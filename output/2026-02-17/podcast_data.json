Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Of this, $1 billion is dedicated to early-stage investments, while the rest is for growth-stage investments, according to an announcement from the firm.\nThrive told Bloomberg that this latest fundraise was oversubscribed. This is the firm\u2019s 10th fund \u2014 called Thrive X \u2014 and comes as some of the firm\u2019s biggest investments, including OpenAI, Stripe, and SpaceX, continue to soar in value. Some of the firm\u2019s other notable investments include Databricks, Anduril, and Cursor. The firm also incubates companies, having spun up 12 so far, with at least six now having reached unicorn status.\nThe firm\u2019s strategy is to \u201ccommit deeply to a small number of founders,\u201d the firm said in its announcement. \u201cConcentration demands loyalty to the founders and missions we back.\u201d\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, Josh Kushner, founder of the firm, said he believed the winners of the AI boom would \u201cbe bigger than we can ever imagine,\u201d and that the technology is still nascent.\nThrive\u2019s massive raise also hints at something else. IPO rumors have swirled around OpenAI and SpaceX in particular, bringing considerable interest from limited partners awaiting returns. These two companies could lead to an unprecedented flow of capital back to limited partners.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Thrive for more information.\n\ntitle1:\nApple is reportedly cooking up a trio of AI wearables\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nLate last month, The Information reported that Apple was developing an AI wearable \u2014 an AirTag-sized pendant with cameras that could be pinned to a user\u2019s shirt. Now, Bloomberg writes that the development of such a device \u2014 along with two other AI-powered items \u2014 is accelerating as Apple looks to stay competitive with other tech giants that are racing to release similar products.\nIn addition to the AI pin, Apple is also speeding up the development of its upcoming AI-powered smart glasses, which have been code-named N50, the report claims. Apple obviously has competition in this space, as other companies \u2014 including Meta (which is arguably the most successful player when it comes to smart glasses) and Snap (which plans to release its \u201cSpecs\u201d later this year) \u2014 are working on similar products.\nApple\u2019s new smart glasses, which will supposedly include a high-resolution camera, may see a public release sooner rather than later, with Bloomberg reporting that the company is \u201ctargeting the start of production as early as December, ahead of a public release in 2027.\u201d\nAdditionally, Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on AirPods with new AI capabilities.\nAll of these items will be designed to connect to the iPhone and will include Siri, the company\u2019s virtual assistant, as a critical component of the user experience, the outlet notes. The glasses are being described as \u201cmore upscale and feature-rich\u201d than the AirPods and the AI pendant, however. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for more information.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla dodges 30-day suspension in California after removing Autopilot\ndescription2:\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles will not suspend Tesla\u2019s sales and manufacturing licenses for 30 days because the EV maker has stopped using the term \u201cAutopilot\u201d in the marketing of its vehicles in the state.\nThe decision, issued late Tuesday, means Tesla can continue selling its EVs in California without interruption and officially settles a case that has been dragging on for nearly three years. California is Tesla\u2019s biggest U.S. market.\nIn November 2023, the DMV filed accusations that Tesla violated state law by using deceptive marketing of Autopilot, its basic advanced driver assistance system, as well as its more capable Full Self-Driving driver assistance software. The state regulator argued that the terms mislead customers and distorted the capabilities of the advanced driver assistance systems.\nTesla stopped using the term \u201cFull Self-Driving Capability,\u201d and instead used Full Self-Driving (Supervised) to more accurately describe the system and clarify that drivers were still required to monitor it. But Tesla held on to the Autopilot term, prompting the DMV to refer the case to an administrative law judge at the California Office of Administrative Hearings.\nIn December, the administrative law judge agreed with the DMV\u2019s request to suspend Tesla\u2019s sales and manufacturing licenses in the state for 30 days as a penalty for its actions. The DMV agreed with the ruling, but didn\u2019t pounce; instead, the state regulator gave Tesla 60 days to comply.\n\u201cSince then, Tesla took corrective action and has stopped using the misleading term \u2018Autopilot\u2019 in the marketing of its electric vehicles in California,\u201d the DMV stated in a release posted on its website. \u201cTesla had previously modified its use of the term \u2018Full Self-Driving\u2019 to clarify that driver supervision is required. By taking this prescribed action, Tesla will avoid having its dealer and manufacturer licenses suspended in the state for 30 days by the DMV.\u201d\nTesla didn\u2019t just stop using the term Autopilot, though. In January, the company discontinued Autopilot in the U.S. and Canada altogether. The move not only helped it comply with the DMV but was also viewed as a way to boost adoption of FSD, which unlike Autopilot, requires the owner to pay for the upgraded system.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Researchers have previously found evidence of Predator abuse in Egypt, Greece, and Vietnam, where the government reportedly targeted U.S. officials by sending the spyware via links on X.\nContact Us Do you have more information about Intellexa? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you have more information about Intellexa? Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email .\nIntellexa is one of the most controversial spyware makers of the last few years, operating from different jurisdictions to skirt export laws and using an \u201copaque web of corporate entities\u201d \u2014 as a U.S government official put it at the time \u2014 to hide its activities.\nIn 2024, around the same time one of Intellexa\u2019s customers was targeting C\u00e2ndido with its spyware, the outgoing Biden administration sanctioned the company, as well as its founder Tal Dilian and his business partner Sara Aleksandra Fayssal Hamou.\nEarlier this year, the Treasury lifted sanctions against three other executives tied to Intellexa, a decision that left Senate Democrats demanding answers from the Trump administration.\nDilian did not respond to a request for comment.\nAn example of a malicious link sent by the hackers to C\u00e2ndido on WhatsApp. Image Credits:Amnesty International\nAmnesty researchers wrote in the report that they linked the intrusions to Intellexa by examining forensic traces found on C\u00e2ndido\u2019s phone. Amnesty said that Intellexa used infection servers that had been previously linked to the company\u2019s spyware infrastructure.\nSeveral hours after clicking on the link that led to his phone hack, C\u00e2ndido rebooted his phone, which wiped the spyware from his device. Amnesty said it wasn\u2019t clear how the spyware was capable of hacking C\u00e2ndido\u2019s phone, as his phone was running an outdated version of iOS at the time.\nThe researchers found that Predator stayed hidden by impersonating legitimate iOS system processes to avoid detection.\nAmnesty believes C\u00e2ndido may be just one of many targets in the country, based on their findings that they were able to find multiple domains linked to the spyware maker used in Angola.\n\u201cThe first domains linked to Angola were deployed as early as March 2023, indicating the start of Predator testing or deployment in the country,\u201d wrote the Amnesty researchers, who added that they had no evidence to determine exactly who hacked C\u00e2ndido.\n\u201cIt is not currently possible to conclusively identify the customer of the Predator spyware in the country,\u201d read the report.\nLast year, based on leaks of internal documents, Amnesty and media organizations revealed that Intellexa employees had the ability to access customers\u2019 systems remotely, potentially giving the spyware maker visibility into government surveillance operations.\nThose leaks, like this report, shows that despite its controversies and sanctions, Intellexa has remained active in recent years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now seen confirmed abuses in Angola, Egypt, Pakistan, Greece, and beyond \u2014 and for every case we uncover, many more abuses surely remain hidden,\u201d said Donncha \u00d3 Cearbhaill, the head of the security lab at Amnesty International.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta's own research found parental supervision doesn't really help curb teens' compulsive social media use\ndescription4:\nAn internal research study at Meta dubbed \u201cProject MYST\u201d created in partnership with the University of Chicago, found that parental supervision and controls \u2014 such as time limits and restricted access \u2014 had little impact on kids\u2019 compulsive use of social media. The study also found that kids who experienced stressful life events were more likely to lack the ability to moderate their social media use appropriately.\nThis was one of the notable claims revealed during testimony at the social media addiction trial that began last week in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is identified by her initials \u201cKGM\u201d or her first name, \u201cKaley.\u201d She, along with her mother and others joining the case, is accusing social media companies of creating \u201caddictive and dangerous\u201d products that led the young users to suffer anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia, eating disorders, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and more.\nThe case is now one of several landmark trials that will take place this year, which accuse social media companies of harming children. The results of these lawsuits will impact these companies\u2019 approach to their younger users and could prompt regulators to take further action.\nIn this case, the plaintiff sued Meta, YouTube, ByteDance (TikTok), and Snap, but the latter two companies had settled their claims before the trial\u2019s start.\nIn the jury trial now underway in LA, Kaley\u2019s lawyer, Mark Lanier, brought up an internal study at Meta, which he said found evidence that Meta knew of, yet didn\u2019t publicize, these specific harms.\nIn Project MYST, which stands for the Meta and Youth Social Emotional Trends survey, Meta\u2019s research concluded that \u201cparental and household factors have little association with teens\u2019 reported levels of attentiveness to their social media use.\u201d\nOr, in other words, even when parents try to control their children\u2019s social media use, either by using parental controls or even just household rules and supervision, it doesn\u2019t impact whether or not the child will overuse social media or use it compulsively. The study was based on a survey of 1,000 teens and their parents about their social media use.\nThe study also noted that both parents and teens agreed on this front, saying \u201cthere is no association between either parental reports or teen reports of parental supervision, and teens\u2019 survey measures of attentiveness or capability.\u201d\nIf the study\u2019s findings are accurate, that would mean that the use of things like the built-in parental controls in the Instagram app or the time limits on smartphones wouldn\u2019t necessarily help teens become less inclined to overuse social media, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer argued. As the original complaint alleges, teens are being exploited by social media products, whose defects include algorithmic feeds designed to keep users scrolling, intermittent variable rewards that manipulate dopamine delivery, incessant notifications, deficient tools for parental controls, and more.\nDuring his testimony, Instagram head Adam Mosseri claimed not to be familiar with Meta\u2019s Project MYST, even though a document seemed to indicate he had given his approval to move forward with the study.\n\u201cWe do a lot of research projects,\u201d Mosseri said, after claiming he couldn\u2019t remember anything specific about MYST beyond its name.\nHowever, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer pointed to this study as an example of why social media companies should be held accountable for their alleged harms, not the parents. He noted that Kaley\u2019s mother, for example, had tried to stop her daughter\u2019s social media addiction and use, even taking her phone away at times.\nWhat\u2019s more, the study found that teens who had a greater number of adverse life experiences \u2014 like those dealing with alcoholic parents, harassment at school, or other issues \u2014 reported less attentiveness over their social media use. That means that kids facing trauma in their real lives were more at risk of addiction, the lawyer argued.\nOn the stand, Mosseri seemed to partially agree with this finding, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of reasons this can be the case. One I\u2019ve heard often is that people use Instagram as a way to escape from a more difficult reality.\u201d Meta is careful not to label any sort of overuse as addiction; instead, Mosseri stated that the company uses the term \u201cproblematic use\u201d to refer to someone \u201cspending more time on Instagram than they feel good about.\u201d\nLawyers for Meta, meanwhile, pushed the idea that the study was more narrowly focused on understanding if teens felt they were using social media too much, not whether or not they were actually addicted. They also generally aimed to put more of the responsibility on parents and the realities of life as the catalyst for kids like Kaley\u2019s negative emotional states, not companies\u2019 social media products.\nFor instance, Meta\u2019s lawyers pointed to Kaley being a child of divorced parents, with an abusive father, and facing bullying at school.\nHow the jury will interpret the findings of studies like Project MYST and others, along with the testimonies from both sides, remains to be seen. Mosseri did note, however, that MYST\u2019s findings had not been published publicly, and no warnings were ever issued to teens or parents as a result of the research.\nMeta has been asked for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
