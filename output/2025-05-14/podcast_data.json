Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday May 15), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nYouTube targets TV dollars with NFL deal, bingeable 'shows' from creators\ndescription0:\nYouTube announced a range of initiatives designed to attract more TV ad dollars to its platform at Brandcast, its annual Upfront event for advertisers. Notably, the Google-owned video service is expanding its relationship with the NFL and plans to exclusively stream the NFL\u2019s first Friday game of the 2025-2026 season. It\u2019s also preparing to pilot a new way for creators to reach the audience that watches YouTube on TV through easily organized and bingeable TV shows.\nThe latter was first announced at YouTube\u2019s Made On YouTube event last September, where CEO Neal Mohan explained that creators making a majority of their revenue on TV screens was up more than 30% year-over-year. A new feature being offered to select creators in the pilot program will allow them to organize their content into seasons and episodes \u2014 just like a \u201creal\u201d TV show.\nIn addition to new efforts around \u201cshoppable TV\u201d and tools that let advertisers target major cultural moments like awards season or The PGA Championship, for instance, the company is once again sending a message to advertisers that it\u2019s not just an online video service, it\u2019s actually the new way people watch \u201cTV.\u201d\nAs part of its NFL deal, YouTube says it will exclusively stream the first Friday game hosted in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, to a worldwide audience. This marks the first time that YouTube has served as a live broadcaster for the NFL, it notes. (In the U.S., the game will be available to YouTube TV subscribers.) The company pointed out that users last year watched over 350 million hours of NFL content on the platform, according to its internal data, and had pulled in over 6 million live views when it streamed the NFL\u2019s Super Bowl LIX Flag Football Game. Its expanded deal with the NFL will see it streaming that Flag Football game over multiple years to come.\nFor creators, YouTube\u2019s pitch focuses on bringing their content to the living room.\nHundreds of creators will be a part of the initial pilot, expected to launch in the U.S. this summer, that will allow them to organize their content into a viewing experience designed for the big screen. Creators like Michelle Khare\u2019s Challenge Accepted and Good Mythical Morning with Rhett & Link will use the new tools to turn their content into \u201cseasons\u201d and \u201cepisodes,\u201d to make their content more bingeable on TV.\nThe company is also rolling out ways to shop from YouTube with QR codes and other send-to-phone functionality, and will look to Gemini AI to match ads to popular, relevant content.\nDuring Brandcast, YouTube featured various case studies from brands like Volvo, Inspire Brands (Dunkin\u2019), Hilton, and State Farm, that have used its advertiser tools to reach their audiences. It also reminded marketers that YouTube has been No. 1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than two years, putting it ahead of Netflix, Disney, and Prime Video as of March 2025. The company also touted its more recent focus on podcasts, where it now sees over 1 billion monthly active podcast users.\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo recalls 1,200 robotaxis following low-speed collisions with gates and chains\ndescription1:\nWaymo issued a software recall on 1,200 self-driving vehicles after some of its robotaxis were involved in minor collisions with gates, chains, and other gate-like roadway objects.\nThe software update, which was first reported by Reuters, was conducted late last year, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Alphabet-owned company said in the document that Waymo\u2019s Safety Board decided to conduct a recall to that specific version of driverless software to \u201cfulfill relevant regulatory reporting obligations.\u201d\nNHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation into Waymo\u2019s automated driving system last May after learning of seven incidents in which robotaxis had collided with \u201cstationary and semi-stationary objects such as gates and chains\u201d between December 2022 and April 2024. None of these resulted in injury, according to NHTSA.\nIn November 2024, Waymo rolled out a software update to its fleet of robotaxis, which numbered 1,200 at the time. The software update significantly decreased the likelihood of these types of event, according to documents filed with NHTSA. Today, Waymo has 1,500 commercial robotaxis in operation in Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco.\nSoftware updates were in progress at the time NHTSA\u2019s examination began, according to the documents. The company had ongoing discussions with NHTSA regarding the evaluation of comparative risk for autonomous vehicles and provided the agency with information regarding nine additional collisions with these kinds of barriers, which occurred between February 2024 and December 2024.\nWaymo has issued at least two other recalls. The company issued a software recall in June 2024 to its Jaguar I-Pace robotaxis after one of them collided with a telephone pole. Waymo also recalled previous software in February 2024 after two of its robotaxis crashed into the same pickup truck that was being towed by a tow truck.\n\ntitle2:\nFoxconn gets nod for $435M project to make more of Apple chips in India, eventually\ndescription2:\nFoxconn, a key manufacturer for Apple, has received an approval from India\u2019s cabinet to build a new 37 billion Indian rupees ($435 million) semiconductor plant in a joint venture with the country\u2019s IT giant HCL Group. The deal is the latest move to reduce Apple\u2019s reliance on China and produce more components in India.\nThe plant, which will be located near the Jewar airport in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and is expected to start operating in 2027, will eventually manufacture display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, PCs, and other devices, India\u2019s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at a press conference in New Delhi on Wednesday. Display driver chips handle how screens show images, text, and videos.\nHowever, since India currently lacks advanced chip fabrication facilities, this plant will not do the chip fabrication immediately but will, at first, be used as a semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) facility. That means it will be focused on providing packaging and testing services for chips that have been manufactured elsewhere, a senior official confirmed to TechCrunch.\nVaishnaw, however, is hopeful that this is a step toward India developing its own fabs for making the chips that could power Apple devices, starting with the display panel chips that this facility will be testing.\n\u201cOnce this unit is there, the display panel [manufacturing] will also come to India,\u201d Vaishnaw said, adding that it \u201cwill have a capacity of 20,000 wafers per month and can produce 36 million units monthly.\u201d\nNevertheless, the deal is still another step toward Apple diversifying manufacturing away from China and deepening ties with India. This deal announcement has come just days after Apple CEO Tim Cook said one way Apple is handling the trade uncertainties between the U.S. and China was to have India do more manufacturing and assembly.\nCook at that time implied that deepening ties with India would mean that Apple would not be forced to raise prices on its devices due to tariffs, although the company is said to be considering weighing price increases anyway.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

The company also plans to broaden its India manufacturing base by making other devices, including AirPods.\nThe minister did not confirm the specifics of the incentives the Indian government will offer Foxconn in this joint venture. Under the state-run semiconductor scheme, the Indian government provides fiscal support covering up to 50% of the capital expenditure for a company to set up facilities.\nIn January last year, Foxconn\u2019s subsidiary Hon Hai Technology India Mega Development announced its plans to invest $37.2 million for a 40% stake in the joint venture with HCL.\nThe latest approval comes eight months after New Delhi greenlit a proposal by Kaynes Semicon, a subsidiary of Bengaluru\u2019s Kaynes Technology, to set up a semiconductor facility in Sanand of the western state of Gujarat with a proposed investment of 33 billion Indian rupees ($386 million).\nIn February last year, the Indian government approved allocating up to 1.26 trillion Indian rupees ($15 billion) to build the first three semiconductor plants under its $10 billion incentive program announced in 2021, including its first semiconductor fab facility.\nThe industry is currently anticipating news on what the second phase of the Indian government\u2019s semiconductor incentive program will involve, though Vaishnaw declined to share details on that at Wednesday\u2019s press conference.\n\ntitle3:\nBillionaire founder of Luminar replaced as CEO following ethics inquiry\ndescription3:\nAustin Russell, who became a billionaire after his lidar startup Luminar went public, appears to be out as CEO, according to the company\u2019s board.\nLuminar\u2019s board announced Wednesday \u2014 the same day of its first-quarter earnings report \u2014 it had replaced Russell and appointed Paul Ricci to the role. Ricci is the former chairman and CEO of Nuance.\nThe press release states that Russell resigned as president and CEO and as the chairperson of the board, effective immediately. The board said in the press release the resignation followed a code of business conduct and ethics inquiry for the audit committee of Luminar\u2019s board. Russell will remain on the board and be \u201cavailable to the incoming Chief Executive Officer on transition and technology matters,\u201d according to the release.\nHowever, it\u2019s not clear if Russell was forced out or if he resigned willingly. Russell could not be reached for comment. The board did not provide further details of this ethics inquiry except that it \u201cdoes not impact any of the company\u2019s financial results.\u201d\nIn a further twist, the company\u2019s earnings report and slide presentation makes no mention of the change of leadership. The first-quarter press release even includes an upbeat statement from Russell that outlines the company\u2019s strategy to drive down cost with its new Halo product.\n\u201cIn a world of macro uncertainty and adversity, we\u2019re firing on all cylinders to ramp up production, ramp down costs, and capitalize on the future, as evidenced by our announcements today,\u201d Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis kicks off our new operating plan for Luminar with a unified product platform, enabling radical focus and streamlining of the business, as well as unlocking value throughout our organization.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the press release from the board tells another story.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe are excited to announce Paul as our next CEO,\u201d board member Matt Simoncini said in a statement. \u201cHis track record speaks for itself. He is a visionary leader with a rare combination of technical insight and operational excellence. His commitment to innovation, his ability to scale organizations, and his instinct for anticipating where technology is heading make him the ideal person to lead us into our next chapter of growth. The Board has full confidence in his leadership, and we are excited about what lies ahead.\u201d\nSimonici, who retired as CEO of Lear in 2018, is chair of the board\u2019s audit committee, which also includes Jun Hong Heng, who is the founder and chief investment officer of technology investment firm Crescent Cove Advisers, Evergreen Capital Partners founder Dominick Schiano, and Daniel Tempesta, who served as executive VP and CFO at Nuance.\nLuminar burst onto the autonomous vehicle scene in April 2017 after operating for years in secrecy. Russell, who was just 22 years old at the time, was thrust into the spotlight and became a Silicon Valley success story. Luminar was founded by Russell in 2012, but it would be years before his company would be known by the public. He worked on the Luminar technology as a Thiel fellow, which gives young people $100,000 over two years to drop out of college and pursue their ideas.\nIn 2021, Luminar merged with special purpose acquisition company Gores Metropoulos Inc., with a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Luminar raised $250 million prior to the SPAC announcement.\n\ntitle4:\nThe Kids Online Safety Act is back, with the potential to change the internet\ndescription4:\nThe Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) has been reintroduced into Congress. If passed into law, this bill could impose some of the most significant legislative changes that the internet has seen in the U.S. since the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) of 1998.\nAs it currently stands, KOSA would be able to hold social media platforms legally accountable if it\u2019s proven that these companies aren\u2019t doing enough to protect minors from harm. The bill includes a long list of possible harms, such as eating disorders, sexual exploitation, substance abuse, and suicide. Though it overwhelmingly passed through the Senate last year, the bill was stifled in the House.\nKOSA has faced much backlash since its introduction in 2022.\nHuman rights groups like the ACLU raised concerns that the bill could be weaponized as a tool for censorship and surveillance. While amendments to KOSA have mitigated some of these concerns, groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fight for the Future have remained against the bill.\n\u201cThe bill\u2019s authors have claimed over and over that this bill doesn\u2019t impact speech. But the Duty of Care is about speech: it\u2019s about blocking speech that the government believes is bad for kids,\u201d Fight for the Future wrote in a statement. \u201cAnd the people who will be determining what speech is harmful? They are the same ones using every tool to silence marginalized communities and attack those they perceive as enemies.\u201d\nHowever, KOSA has garnered support from companies like Microsoft, Snap, and X; X CEO Linda Yaccarino even worked with Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) on the most recent draft of the bill. Google and Meta have remained opposed to the bill, but Apple announced today that it will support the legislation.\n\u201cApple is pleased to offer our support for the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA). Everyone has a part to play in keeping kids safe online, and we believe [this] legislation will have a meaningful impact on children\u2019s online safety,\u201d Timothy Powderly, Apple\u2019s senior director of Government Affairs, said in a statement.\"\n\nResponse:",
