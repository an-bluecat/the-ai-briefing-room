Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

This time, it\u2019s Gemini Space Station Inc., the New York-based crypto exchange and custodian bank founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\nThe outfit, which plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GEMI, was founded in 2014 and operates as an exchange and custodian that offers a number of products and services, including a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and a credit card that offers rewards in crypto.\nThe company\u2019s S-1 document, which was filed Friday after markets closed, provides a look at its finances. The upshot: Gemini appears to have widening net losses. The company reported a net loss of $158.5 million on $142.2 million in revenue in 2024. Net losses in the first six months of 2025 havw already exceeded that number. Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue in the six months ending June 30.\nGemini is the latest crypto company to turn to the public markets as the regulatory environment has eased and the Trump administration has embraced digital currencies and other crypto assets.\nIn June, Circle Internet Group raised $1.2 billion in an IPO. The company, one of the world\u2019s largest issuers of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, had a blockbuster debut with its stock trading 168% above its IPO price of $31 set the previous day.\nOn Monday, despite higher revenue than a year earlier, Circle reported a quarterly loss due to one-time costs associated with that June public offering.\nEarlier this month, crypto exchange Bullish, which also owns media outlet CoinDesk, raised $1.1 billion in its IPO. Bullish, led by former president of the NYSE Tom Farley, saw its shares more than double from its $37 IPO price to peak at $118.\n\ntitle1:\nSam Altman, over bread rolls, explores life after GPT-5\ndescription1:\nI\u2019m looking out at Alcatraz Island from a Mediterranean restaurant in San Francisco with hundred-dollar fish entr\u00e9es on the menu. As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman\u2019s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: \u201cNo phone case is a bold choice.\u201d\nOf course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone\u2019s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one.\n\u201cListen, we\u2019re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,\u201d says Altman, referring to OpenAI and Ive\u2019s forthcoming AI device. \u201cIf you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,\u201d he jokes.\nAltman has gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raises more questions than it answers.\nFor instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launching GPT-5? Is this to encourage me to write nice things about OpenAI\u2019s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it?\nUnlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even brought back GPT-4o and ChatGPT\u2019s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5\u2019s tone and its model router.\nBut throughout the night, it becomes clear to me that this dinner is about OpenAI\u2019s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI\u2019s executives give the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOpenAI shares some new details about those efforts.\nAltman says OpenAI\u2019s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, will oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT \u2014 ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of an AI-powered browser that OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome.\nAltman suggests OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome \u2014 likely an offer that would be taken more seriously than Perplexity\u2019s bid \u2014 should it become available. \u201cIf Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,\u201d he says before looking at all of us and asking: \u201cIs it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d\nSimo also might end up running an AI-powered social media app \u2014 something the OpenAI CEO said he\u2019s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there\u2019s \u201cnothing\u201d inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he\u2019s interested in \u201cwhether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.\u201d\nWhile Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s COO, largely give the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirms reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup, Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink. (\u201cWe have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.\u201d)\nHow intertwined that company will be with OpenAI\u2019s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman describes it only as a \u201ca company that we\u2019d invest in.\u201d\nFor all the talk of browsers and brain chips, though, the elephant in the room remains GPT-5\u2019s rough reception. Eventually, the conversation circles back to the model that has prompted our group dinner in the first place.\nTurley and Altman say they\u2019ve learned a lot from the experience.\n\u201cI legitimately just thought we screwed that up,\u201d says Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear \u201ctransition period\u201d when deprecating AI models in the future.\nTurley also says OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5\u2019s responses \u201cwarmer,\u201d but not sycophantic, such that it won\u2019t reinforce negative behaviors in users.\n\u201cGPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality \u2014 I\u2019m German, you know, whatever,\u201d says Turley. \u201cBut many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman says OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships with the chatbot \u2014 which could still be tens of millions of people.\nTurley says OpenAI has worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5\u2019s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors.\nThat said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn\u2019t hurt OpenAI\u2019s business. In fact, Altman says OpenAI\u2019s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5\u2019s launch, and the company is effectively \u201cout of GPUs\u201d thanks to all the demand. Cursor and other AI coding assistants have since made GPT-5 their default AI models.\nIn many ways, the night\u2019s contradictions \u2014 disappointing launches, record-breaking usage \u2014 reflect OpenAI\u2019s strange reality right now.\nGiven OpenAI\u2019s bets on browsers, brain chips, AI chatbots \u2014 and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy \u2014 Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader.\nAs the night winds down, it becomes clear we aren\u2019t gathered to reflect on GPT-5 at all. We are being pitched on a company that\u2019s eager to outgrow its famous and controversial product.\nIt seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands as part of that picture. In preparation, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. But he also wants OpenAI to get to a place where it\u2019s no longer defined by its best AI model.\n\ntitle2:\nSen.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he intends to investigate whether Meta\u2019s generative AI products exploit, deceive, or harm children, after leaked internal documents showed the company\u2019s chatbots were allowed to have \u201cromantic\u201d and \u201csensual\u201d chats with children.\n\u201cIs there anything \u2013 ANYTHING \u2013 Big Tech won\u2019t do for a quick buck?\u201d Hawley wrote in a post on X announcing the investigation.\nHawley chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he says will commence a probe into whether Meta\u2019s tech harms children, and \u201cwhether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards.\u201d\nReuters broke the story after viewing the guidelines, titled \u201cGenAI: Content Risk Standards.\u201d The document noted, among other things, that chatbots were permitted to hold romantic conversations with an 8-year-old that said, \u201cEvery inch of you is a masterpiece \u2013 a treasure I cherish deeply.\u201d\nA Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch that such examples are inconsistent with Meta\u2019s policies and have since been removed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place,\u201d Hawley wrote in a letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that Meta acknowledged the veracity of the reports and \u201cmade retractions only after this alarming content came to light.\u201d\n\u201cWe intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward,\u201d Hawley wrote.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage \u2014 that unassuming gray box that converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a solar stalker\u201d for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system.\nShowalter, the CEO of EG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn\u2019t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it\u2019s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA published an advisory detailing security vulnerabilities in EG4\u2019s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system.\nFor the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4\u2019s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they\u2019re learning is that modern solar inverters aren\u2019t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there\u2019s excess power, feeding it back into the grid.\nMuch of this has happened without people noticing. \u201cNobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,\u201d observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. \u201cNow we\u2019re talking about it at the national and international level.\u201d\nSecurity shortcomings and customers\u2019 complaints\nSome of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations \u2014 primarily residential \u2014 grew more than fivefold between 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change.\nEach solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWhen pressed about his company\u2019s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. \u201cThis is not an EG4 problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an industry-wide problem.\u201d Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor\u2019s inbox, he produced a 14-page report cataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019.\nNot all of his customers \u2014 some of whom took to Reddit to complain \u2014 are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA\u2019s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures.\n\u201cThese were fundamental security lapses,\u201d says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. \u201cAdding insult to injury,\u201d continues this individual, \u201cEG4 didn\u2019t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.\u201d\nAsked why EG4 didn\u2019t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a \u201clive and learn\u201d moment.\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re so close [to addressing CISA\u2019s concerns] and it\u2019s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the \u2018done\u2019 button, and then advise people, so we\u2019re not in the middle of the cake being baked,\u201d says Showalter.\nTechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that \u201cno known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.\u201d\nConnections to China spark security concerns\nWhile unrelated, the timing of EG4\u2019s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment.\nEarlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries. According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers \u2014 components that hadn\u2019t appeared on official hardware lists.\nThis reported discovery carries particular weight given China\u2019s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world\u2019s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.\nThe geopolitical implications haven\u2019t escaped notice. Lithuania last year passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany.\nBut the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4\u2019s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company\u2019s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NIST warns that \u201cif you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.\u201d\nThe good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations.\nPascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers\u2019 solar inverters, as evidenced by security researchers last year.)\nThe regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards currently apply only to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms.\nBecause residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements.\nBut the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum.\nOn the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes.\n\u201cWhen you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.\u201d\nPut another way, the real concern isn\u2019t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity.\nShowalter has embraced CISA\u2019s intervention as what he calls a \u201ctrust upgrade\u201d \u2014 an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures.\nBut for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company\u2019s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they\u2019d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.\n\ntitle4:\nTrump wants to clean up the space industry\u2019s red tape: Here\u2019s who wins\ndescription4:\nDuring a press conference in late 2024, President Donald Trump vowed to \u201cslash massive numbers of job-killing regulations\u201d in his second term and pledged to eliminate 10 old rules for every new one.\nNow he\u2019s bringing that deregulation drive to commercial space, ordering federal agencies to streamline launch licensing, fast-track spaceport development, and clear out the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s industry advisory board.\n\u201cInefficient permitting processes discourage investment and innovation, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to lead in global space markets,\u201d he stated in an Executive Order signed August 13.\nThe order directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to cut \u201coutdated, redundant, or overly restrictive\u201d rules that govern launch and reentry licenses. It also instructs the Federal Aviation Administration, which is housed under the DOT, to eliminate or accelerate environmental reviews, ease the path to building new spaceports, and to appoint a \u201csenior executive\u201d charged with fostering \u201cinnovation and deregulation.\u201d\nThe Commerce Department also has been ordered to stand up a new process for authorizing \u201cnovel space activities,\u201d like in-space manufacturing or satellite refueling, that don\u2019t fit neatly into existing licensing regimes.\nThe executive order came the same day transportation secretary and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy dismissed every member of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC), a long-standing industry advisory board inside the DOT that shapes spaceflight rules and priorities.\nFor companies that have spent years mired in environmental reviews and licensing delays, the order was a welcome sign that future bids would experience shorter timelines and more regulatory clarity. The Commercial Space Federation, an industry trade group whose members include SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and a dozen others, applauded the executive order for providing \u201cregulatory relief to unleash the U.S. commercial space industry.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

State-backed spaceport operators, like Space Florida, may also be aided by provisions that accelerate new site development.\nCreating a mission authorization framework for \u201cnovel\u201d space activities is equally consequential: startups like Varda Space Industries or Orbit Fab, which are developing technologies to manufacture pharmaceuticals in space and in-orbit refueling, respectively, may gain an advantage by a regulatory approach led by Commerce.\nEnvironmental rule sticking point\nNot everyone is celebrating the order. The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an environmental group that has challenged the FAA\u2019s approval of SpaceX\u2019s Starship program in Texas, called the order \u201creckless.\u201d\n\u201cBending the knee to powerful corporations by allowing federal agencies to ignore bedrock environmental laws is incredibly dangerous and puts all of us in harm\u2019s way. This is clearly not in the public interest,\u201d senior attorney Jared Margolis said.\nFor groups like CBD, environmental reviews are not \u201coverly complex,\u201d as the Order charges \u2014 they are often completely insufficient. In 2023, environmental groups, including the CBD, alleged that the FAA\u2019s environmental assessment of SpaceX\u2019s South Texas plans were inadequate and in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.\nSpaceX has separately waged an increasingly public campaign against \u201csuperfluous\u201d regulations and environmental analyses that have hindered a speedier test campaign.\nThere are still some unknowns. Legal challenges to the order could slow progress, and the new COMSTAC members, who have yet to be appointed, will inform the future of space rule-making.\"\n\nResponse:",
