Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over three years ago \u2014 and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.6 trillion market cap company.\nThe world\u2019s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI.\nNvidia has participated in nearly 67 venture capital deals in 2025, surpassing the 54 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 30 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.)\nNvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be \u201cgame changers and market makers.\u201d\nBelow is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round.\nThis list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products.\nThe billion-dollar-round club\nOpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker\u2019s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI\u2019s other backers, notably Thrive, which invested $1.3 billion according to The New York Times. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI\u2019s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the company announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. Nvidia later revealed in its quarterly filings that it might not follow through, stating, \u201cThere is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAnthropic: In November 2025, Nvidia made its first direct investment in the AI lab, committing up to $10 billion as part of a strategic round that included a $5 billion check from Microsoft. In a \u201ccircular\u201d spending agreement, Anthropic committed to spending $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute capacity, as well as buy Nvidia\u2019s future Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin systems.\nCursor: In November, Nvidia made its first strategic investment in the AI-powered code assistant participating in a massive $2.3 billion Series D round co-led by Accel and Coatue. The deal valued Cursor at $29.3 billion, a nearly 15-fold increase since the start of the year. While Nvidia has long been an enterprise customer, the round marked its official entry as a shareholder alongside Google.\nxAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk\u2019s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI\u2019s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear.\nMistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a \u20ac1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a \u20ac11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September.\nReflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\nThinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati\u2019s Thinking Machines Lab\u2019s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion.\nInflection: One of Nvidia\u2019s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection\u2019s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection\u2019s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future.\nCrusoe: In October, the chipmaker participated in a $1.4 billion Series E round that valued the AI data center developer at $10 billion. Nvidia first backed the company in late 2024 during its Series D. Crusoe is a key infrastructure partner for the \u2018Stargate\u2019 project, building massive data center campuses in Texas and Wyoming to be leased to Oracle specifically to power OpenAI\u2019s workloads.\nNscale: After the startup\u2019s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale\u2019s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That\u2019s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI\u2019s Stargate project.\nWayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nFigure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI\u2019s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation.\nScale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees.\nThe many-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars club\nCommonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup\u2019s $863 million funding round in August. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion.\nCohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023.\nPerplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company\u2019s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup\u2019s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company\u2019s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data.\nPoolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion.\nLambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda\u2019s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia\u2019s GPUs.\nBlack Forest Labs: Nvidia participated in a $300 million Series B for the German startup behind the \u201cFlux\u201d image generation models in December. The round, which was co-led by Salesforce Ventures and Anjney Midha (AMP) valued the company at $3.25 billion.\nCoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That\u2019s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder.\nTogether AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023.\nFirmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient \u201cAI factory\u201d in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining.\nUniphore: In October, Nvidia joined fellow tech giants AMD, Snowflake, and Databricks to lead a $260 million Series F round into this Business AI company. Uniphore\u2019s multimodal platform helps enterprises automate complex workflows and deploy \u201cAI agents\u201d across customer service, sales, and marketing.\nSakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Sakana raised another $135 million at a $2.65 billion valuation in November, but Nvidia didn\u2019t participate in the round.\nNuro: In August, Nvidia participated in a $203 million funding round for the self-driving delivery startup. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021.\nImbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt.\nWaabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE.\nDeals of over a $100 million\nAyar Labs: In December 2024, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup.\nKore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity.\nSandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ\u2019s Series E round to $450 million and the company\u2019s valuation to $5.75 billion.\nHippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Hippocratic raised another $126 million at a valuation of $3.5 billion in November, but Nvidia didn\u2019t participate in the round.\nWeka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion.\nRunway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway\u2019s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data.

The deal tripled the startup\u2019s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.\nThis post was first published in January 2025.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla annual sales decline 9% as it\u2019s overtaken by BYD as global EV leader\ndescription1:\nTesla annual sales have fallen for the second year in a row, a drop fueled by the removal of the federal tax credit in the U.S. and competition from Chinese automakers.\nTesla delivered 1.63 million vehicles globally in 2025, a 9% fall from 1.79 million in 2024, according to figures released by the company. Notably, about 50,850 of those vehicles are considered \u201cother models,\u201d a collection that includes the Cybertruck as well as its older Model X and Model S.\nTesla reported fourth-quarter sales of 418,227, a 15.6% drop from the same period last year and far more than analysts expected. Tesla stock fell more than 2% as the market opened after the New Year holiday.\nTesla, once the global EV sales leader, has seen its market share in Europe and China eroded by the rise of Chinese competitors. China\u2019s BYD, which delivered 2.26 million EVs in 2025, has now taken the top global EV sales spot. Tesla is also facing more competition in the United States \u2014 although notably not from Chinese automakers, which are barred from selling vehicles in the country.\nBut it was the elimination of the $7,500 U.S. federal tax incentive that seems to have delivered the biggest blow in the fourth quarter. Tesla sold a record-breaking 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter \u2014 a 29% increase from the previous quarter \u2014 as consumers raced to buy EVs before the federal EV tax credit disappeared. Since then, sales have retreated in spite of efforts to woo buyers.\nTesla\u2019s declining sales comes as CEO Elon Musk tries to pivot the company away from the business of making and selling EVs and toward AI and robotics. Musk\u2019s pitch is there is money to be made in \u201csustainable abundance,\u201d a catchphrase used throughout the company\u2019s recent Master Plan IV that describes an ecosystem of sustainable products, from transport to energy generation, battery storage, and robotics.\nAnd yet, the bulk of Tesla\u2019s income comes from its EV business. For instance, Tesla generated $28 billion in revenue in the third quarter, of which $21.2 billion came from selling EVs.\n\ntitle2:\nIndia orders Musk's X to fix Grok over 'obscene' AI content\ndescription2:\nIndia has ordered Elon Musk\u2019s X to make immediate technical and procedural changes to its AI chatbot Grok after users and lawmakers flagged the generation of \u201cobscene\u201d content, including AI-altered images of women created using the tool.\nOn Friday, India\u2019s IT ministry issued the order directing Musk\u2019s X to take corrective action on Grok, including restricting the generation of content involving \u201cnudity, sexualization, sexually explicit, or otherwise unlawful\u201d material. The ministry also gave the social media platform 72 hours to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting or dissemination of content deemed \u201cobscene, pornographic, vulgar, indecent, sexually explicit, pedophilic, or otherwise prohibited under law.\u201d\nThe order, reviewed by TechCrunch, warned that failure to comply could jeopardize X\u2019s \u201csafe harbor\u201d protections \u2014 legal immunity from liability for user-generated content under Indian law.\nIndia\u2019s move follows concerns raised by users who shared examples of Grok being prompted to alter images of individuals \u2014 primarily women \u2014 to make them appear to be wearing bikinis, prompting a formal complaint from Indian parliamentarian Priyanka Chaturvedi. Separately, recent reports flagged instances in which the AI chatbot generated sexualized images involving minors, an issue X acknowledged earlier on Friday was caused by lapses in safeguards. Those images were later taken down.\nHowever, images generated using Grok that made women appear to be wearing bikinis through AI alteration remained accessible on X at the time of publication, TechCrunch found.\nThe latest order comes days after the Indian IT ministry issued a broader advisory on Monday, which was also reviewed by TechCrunch, to social media platforms, reminding them that compliance with local laws governing obscene and sexually explicit content is a prerequisite for retaining legal immunity from liability for user-generated material. The advisory urged companies to strengthen internal safeguards and warned that failure to do so could invite legal action under India\u2019s IT and criminal laws.\n\u201cIt is reiterated that non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, its responsible officers and the users on the platform who violate the law, without any further notice,\u201d the order warned.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe Indian government said noncompliance could lead to action against X under India\u2019s IT law and criminal statutes.\nIndia, one of the world\u2019s biggest digital markets, has emerged as a critical test case for how far governments are willing to go in holding platforms responsible for AI-generated content. Any tightening of enforcement in the country could have ripple effects for global technology companies operating across multiple jurisdictions.\nThe order comes as Musk\u2019s X continues to challenge aspects of India\u2019s content regulation rules in court, arguing that federal government takedown powers risk overreach, even as the platform has complied with a majority of blocking directives. At the same time, Grok has been increasingly used by X users for real-time fact-checking and commentary on news events, making its outputs more visible \u2014 and more politically sensitive \u2014 than those of stand-alone AI tools.\nX and xAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Indian government\u2019s order.\n\ntitle3:\nThe 16 top logistics, manufacturing, materials startups from Disrupt Startup Battlefield\ndescription3:\nEvery year, TechCrunch\u2019s Startup Battlefield pitch contest draws thousands of applicants.

As the name suggests, this latest device is another version of the Pebble smartwatch, but with a rounded screen, giving it a more upscale look. But like other Pebble devices, the new watch is still an affordable purchase at $199.\nPebble keeps its smartwatches\u2019 cost down by limiting what they can do. In the case of the new Pebble Round 2, the device offers basic health and activity tracking, like steps and sleep, but it doesn\u2019t include a heart rate monitor or other features that would make it a fitness or sports watch alternative.\nThe trade-off is longer battery life \u2014 the Pebble Round 2 should last 10 to 14 days before needing a charge.\nLike the recently launched Pebble Time 2, the Pebble Round 2 is the company\u2019s reboot of an older smartwatch. Back in 2015, Pebble launched its first rounded watch with the Pebble Time Round, which the company called the industry\u2019s thinnest smartwatch at the time.\nThe newer version maintains that slim look, at just 8.1 mm in thickness, compared with the original\u2019s 7.5 mm.\nImage Credits:Pebble\n\u201c[The Pebble Time Round] was, by far, one of my favorite Pebbles, but it wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d said Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cIt had a few things we could improve, most notably being the gigantic bezel around the edge.\u201d\nTo make the original rounded watch face, the team had used an octagonal piece of glass with rounded edges that were hidden by a large bezel. But the result was a device that didn\u2019t have a very large screen. Technology has since improved, of course, so the new device\u2019s larger screen allows you to see more text. The updated design looks better, too.\nThe touchscreen is now a 1.3\u2033 color e-paper display (260 x 260 pixels at 283 DPI \u2014 or twice as many pixels as the original Pebble Time Round). The screen has a backlight, too, so you can see it at night. Under the hood, the Round 2 runs the open source Pebble OS.\nImage Credits:Pebble\nThe watch\u2019s dual microphones, meanwhile, allow for speech input and replying to messages. (This is currently an Android-only feature, because of Apple\u2019s restrictions. But iOS will be supported in the EU in the days ahead.)\nThe side buttons let you do things like silence incoming calls, play and pause music, navigate, go back, and scroll.\nMigicovsky says one advantage of buttons is that they allow you to use the watch without having to look down. \u201cSay, for example, someone\u2019s calling, and you\u2019re in a meeting, and you just don\u2019t want to answer the call,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t even want to look at your watch. You always know that the bottom button cancels the call. Or if you\u2019re listening to music and you\u2019ve got AirPods in and you don\u2019t want to fiddle with the AirPods or look at your phone, you always know that the center button pauses music.\u201d\nImage Credits:Pebble\nThe watch also has a stainless steel frame, accelerometer, and magnetometer, and includes a silicone watch band and a Pebble charge dongle. Leather bands will be made available separately.\nThere are three watch color options to choose from, but each supports different band sizes. The matte black has a 20 mm quick-release band; the silver supports either a 14 mm or 20 mm band; and the polished rose gold supports only the 14 mm band.\nThe Pebble Round 2 can run thousands of apps and watch faces available on the Pebble Appstore, though developers will need to update their apps to support the rounded screen using the provided SDK. Among the apps that can be accessed are AI assistants, like those that support Claude and other popular assistants.\nPebble is also working on AI features for its devices. The company recently launched an AI smart ring that can record audio and transcribe conversations. When asked, Migicovsky said functionality similar to what\u2019s in the ring will later come to Pebble watches, too.\nThe new Pebble Round 2 will be available for preorder on January 2 from Pebble\u2019s website. It should ship in May. Customers who previously ordered the Pebble Time 2 will also have the option to switch to the Pebble Round 2 if they choose.\"\n\nResponse:",
