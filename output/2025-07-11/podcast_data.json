Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

OpenAI had planned to release the model next week, however Altman said the company is pushing it back indefinitely for further safety testing.\n\u201cWe need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us,\u201d said Altman in a post on X. \u201cWhile we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can\u2019t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s open model release is one of the most highly anticipated AI events of the summer, alongside the ChatGPT-maker\u2019s expected release of GPT-5. Unlike GPT-5, OpenAI\u2019s open model will be available for developers to freely download and run locally. Through both of these launches, OpenAI will attempt to demonstrate that it is still Silicon Valley\u2019s leading AI lab \u2014 an increasingly difficult task as xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic invest billions of dollars in their own efforts.\nThe delay means developers will have to wait a little longer to try the first open model OpenAI has released in years. TechCrunch previously reported that OpenAI\u2019s open model is expected to have similar reasoning capabilities to the company\u2019s o-series of models, and that OpenAI planned for it to be best-in-class compared to other open models.\nThe ecosystem of open AI models became a little more competitive this week. Earlier on Friday, Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2, a one trillion parameter open AI model that outperforms OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks.\nIn June, when Altman announced the initial delays around OpenAI\u2019s open model, he noted that the company had achieved something \u201cunexpected and quite amazing,\u201d but didn\u2019t elaborate on what that was.\n\u201cCapability wise, we think the model is phenomenal \u2014 but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we\u2019re releasing a model we\u2019re proud of along every axis,\u201d said Aidan Clark, OpenAI\u2019s VP of research who is leading the open model team, in a post on X Friday.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nTechCrunch previously reported that OpenAI leaders have discussed enabling the open AI model to connect to the company\u2019s cloud-hosted AI models for complex queries. However, it\u2019s unclear if these features will make it into the final open model.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla reportedly close to starting sales in India\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nTesla is nearly ready to start selling its electric vehicles in India, according to Bloomberg News, after years of flirting with the idea. The company is about to open its first showroom in Mumbai and could start deliveries as early as August, according to the report.\nA few hours after Bloomberg published its report, Tesla created an account specifically for its Indian operation on CEO Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform X. The account has one post so far: an illustration of the Mumbai skyline with the caption \u201cComing soon.\u201d\nTesla has been pushing into a number of new markets as it exhausts existing ones with an aging lineup of EVs. Earlier this year, the company started selling EVs in the oil-rich nation of Saudi Arabia.\nIndia could be particularly challenging for a number of reasons, including price. Tesla will have to export already-built vehicles to the country, and so they will be subject to a 70% import duty, according to Reuters. Tesla once held talks with Indian government officials and came close to executing an agreement to build a factory there. But the company never went through with the deal.\n\ntitle2:\nWindsurf's CEO goes to Google; OpenAI's acquisition falls apart\ndescription2:\nOpenAI\u2019s deal to acquire the viral AI coding startup Windsurf for $3 billion fell apart on Friday, according to The Verge.\nIn a shocking twist, Google DeepMind is now hiring Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and some of the startup\u2019s top researchers. A Google spokesperson confirmed the hiring of Windsurf\u2019s leaders in a statement to TechCrunch.\nNotably, Google is not taking a stake in Windsurf and will not have any control over the company. However, as part of the deal, Google will have a nonexclusive license to certain Windsurf technology, meaning the AI coding startup remains free to license its technology to others.\nBloomberg reports that Google is paying $2.4 billion to license Windsurf\u2019s technology and hire its top employees.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to welcome some top AI coding talent from Windsurf\u2019s team to Google DeepMind to advance our work in agentic coding,\u201d said Google spokesperson Chris Pappas in an email to TechCrunch.\nThe deal represents the AI ecosystem\u2019s latest reverse-acquihire, in which a company hires a startup\u2019s top talent and licenses its technology but does not outright acquire the company. Google previously conducted a similar deal to hire back Character.AI CEO Noam Shazeer, as did Microsoft to hire Mustafa Suleyman. These deals have helped several Big Tech companies increase their position in the AI race without drawing regulatory scrutiny.\n\u201cWe are excited to be joining Google DeepMind along with some of the Windsurf team,\u201d said Mohan and Chen in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are proud of what Windsurf has built over the last four years and are excited to see it move forward with their world class team and kick-start the next phase.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nAs of Friday, Windsurf\u2019s head of business, Jeff Wang, will take over as the startup\u2019s interim CEO, he announced in a post on social media. Most of Windsurf\u2019s 250 person team is not headed to Google DeepMind and will continue offering its AI coding tools for enterprise customers.\nBig welcome to @_mohansolo and others from the Windsurf team joining Deepmind : ) \u2014 Logan Kilpatrick (@OfficialLoganK) July 11, 2025\nOpenAI\u2019s deal to acquire Windsurf has reportedly been a major tension point in the ChatGPT maker\u2019s contract renegotiations with Microsoft. Microsoft currently has access to all of OpenAI\u2019s intellectual property; however, OpenAI didn\u2019t want its largest backer to get Windsurf\u2019s AI coding technology as well, according to previous reporting from the Wall Street Journal.\nEarlier on Friday, Fortune reported that the exclusivity period on OpenAI\u2019s offer to acquire Windsurf had expired, meaning that Windsurf would now be free to explore other offers. It seems that Windsurf didn\u2019t wait long.\nIn recent months, Windsurf has been one of the hottest AI coding startups on the market. In April, the startup\u2019s ARR reached about $100 million, TechCrunch previously reported, up from about $40 million months earlier. That rapid growth attracted suitors such as OpenAI and apparently Google.\nThe addition of Mohan, Chen, and other Windsurf leaders could significantly boost Google\u2019s ability to build AI coding tools. In recent months, AI model providers have focused more on offering AI coding applications to entice developers. Anthropic has boosted its revenue significantly on the back of its AI coding tool, Claude Code, while OpenAI continues to pitch Codex, its AI coding agent, to software engineers.\nWindsurf, on the other hand, is left in a much more uncertain position as a result of this deal. Other AI startups that have seen their leaders hired away have struggled to sustain the same momentum they had beforehand. Scale AI lost customers as a result of its deal with Meta, whereas Inflection had to pivot entirely from consumer AI after its deal with Microsoft.\nIt seems likely that Windsurf could suffer a similar fate.\nUpdate 7:25 pm PT: This article was updated to include the reported price Google paid Windsurf in the deal.\n\ntitle3:\nFirefly Aerospace files for an IPO\ndescription3:\nFirefly Aerospace is taking its orbital ambitions to the public markets. The company, which notched a string of successes this year, including a historic commercial moon landing, submitted its formal declaration to regulators Friday detailing its plans to IPO sometime this year.\nThe S-1 document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission provides a wide-ranging look into the company\u2019s finances and governance plans, though the number of shares to be offered and their price range has not been disclosed. This means the final valuation is still to be determined.\nFirefly is heading into the initial public offering with $176.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. And while it has incurred negative cash flows and losses from operations, Firefly projected that its cash is adequate to meet its liquidity needs for at least 12 months.\nThe company does have a lot of debt: about $173.6 million, including a $136.1 million term loan with a 13.87% interest rate. The net proceeds from the IPO will be used in part to repay that outstanding loan, according to the S-1.\nFirefly reportedly scored $55.8 million in revenue as of March 31, up from just $8.3 million for the same period in 2024. The majority of that \u2014 around $50 million \u2014 is from \u201cspacecraft solutions,\u201d or its Blue Ghost lander missions, and just $5 million from launch. But hardware is an expensive endeavor, and Firefly is still burning a lot of money: The cost of sales, or incurred expenses, was nearly as much as revenue \u2014 about $53 million as of March 31, leaving just $2.2 million in gross profit.\nThe company operated at a net loss of $231.1 million for the 2024 fiscal year, up from $135.5 million in 2023. Its net losses at the end of the first quarter were $60.1 million.\nYet the company tells prospective investors that it sees nothing but growth ahead, and there\u2019s a handful of huge developments in the pipeline that could prove that to be true. That includes a major partnership with defense giant Northrop Grumman for a new, reusable launch vehicle called Eclipse, a launch agreement for up to 25 launches with Lockheed Martin, and the impending commercial debut of Elytra, a spacecraft line designed for in-space transportation services.\nThe company also cited strong customer demand, noting that as of March 31 it had about $1.1 billion worth of backlogged launch orders and spacecraft contracts. That\u2019s about double from the $560 million in backlogged orders it had from a year prior. That big boost came from three multi-launch agreements for Firefly\u2019s small Alpha rocket and an additional lunar delivery contract for its Blue Ghost lander.\nThe regulatory document also states Firefly intends to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d \u2014 essentially, that it will leverage Nasdaq rules to ensure that AE Industrial Partners, the private equity firm that bought a majority stake in Firefly in 2022, will retain significant governance control over the company even after it is listed on the public markets.\nThe company intends to list on the Nasdaq Global Markets under the ticker symbol $FLY. The news comes after a relative quiet period of space company exits. There was a slew of space companies that went public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies in 2021 and 2022, many of which have failed to perform.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nFirefly\u2019s IPO will likely provide some much-needed liquidity to the market. Its IPO comes just one month after Voyager Space, a space company building the private space station Starlab, filed its IPO paperwork last month.\n\ntitle4:\nGoldman Sachs is testing viral AI agent Devin as a \u2018new employee\u2019\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nCognition\u2019s AI coding agent Devin has scored a major customer: Goldman Sachs, the bank\u2019s CIO, Marco Argenti, told CNBC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee,\u201d Argenti told the outlet, adding that it plans to roll out hundreds of instances of Devin, potentially growing to thousands. The bank currently employs around 12,000 human developers, it says.\nDespite the financial industry\u2019s reputation for being slow and stodgy, Goldman Sachs tends to be cutting edge, and it\u2019s been internally using developer copilots since at least 2024, it said.\nDevin is an interesting choice. When Cognition released it last year, it blew up on social media. Some researchers then found that it struggled with more complex coding work.\nAs of May, Devin is now on version 2.1, and Cognition says it performs best on large codebases that provide it with ample context.\nDevin won\u2019t replace humans at the bank. Argenti advocates for a \u201chybrid\u201d workforce, so instances of it will be supervised by a human and, he hopes, improve their productivity.\"\n\nResponse:",
