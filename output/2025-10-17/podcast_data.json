In separate instances, they alleged that certain advocates of AI safety are not as virtuous as they appear, and are either acting in the interest of themselves or billionaire puppet masters behind the scenes.\nAI safety groups that spoke with TechCrunch say the allegations from Sacks and OpenAI are Silicon Valley\u2019s latest attempt to intimidate its critics, but certainly not the first. In 2024, some venture capital firms spread rumors that a California AI safety bill, SB 1047, would send startup founders to jail. The Brookings Institution labeled the rumor as one of many \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d about the bill, but Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed it anyway.\nWhether or not Sacks and OpenAI intended to intimidate critics, their actions have sufficiently scared several AI safety advocates. Many nonprofit leaders that TechCrunch reached out to in the last week asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to spare their groups from retaliation.\nThe controversy underscores Silicon Valley\u2019s growing tension between building AI responsibly and building it to be a massive consumer product \u2014 a theme my colleagues Kirsten Korosec, Anthony Ha, and I unpack on this week\u2019s Equity podcast. We also dive into a new AI safety law passed in California to regulate chatbots, and OpenAI\u2019s approach to erotica in ChatGPT.\nOn Tuesday, Sacks wrote a post on X alleging that Anthropic \u2014 which has raised concerns over AI\u2019s ability to contribute to unemployment, cyberattacks, and catastrophic harms to society \u2014 is simply fearmongering to get laws passed that will benefit itself and drown out smaller startups in paperwork. Anthropic was the only major AI lab to endorse California\u2019s Senate Bill 53 (SB 53), a bill that sets safety reporting requirements for large AI companies, which was signed into law last month.\nSacks was responding to a viral essay from Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark about his fears regarding AI. Clark delivered the essay as a speech at the Curve AI safety conference in Berkeley weeks earlier. Sitting in the audience, it certainly felt like a genuine account of a technologist\u2019s reservations about his products, but Sacks didn\u2019t see it that way.\nAnthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering. It is principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem. https://t.co/C5RuJbVi4P \u2014 David Sacks (@DavidSacks) October 14, 2025\nSacks said Anthropic is running a \u201csophisticated regulatory capture strategy,\u201d though it\u2019s worth noting that a truly sophisticated strategy probably wouldn\u2019t involve making an enemy out of the federal government. In a follow up post on X, Sacks noted that Anthropic has positioned \u201citself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration.\u201d\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAlso this week, OpenAI\u2019s chief strategy officer, Jason Kwon, wrote a post on X explaining why the company was sending subpoenas to AI safety nonprofits, such as Encode, a nonprofit that advocates for responsible AI policy. (A subpoena is a legal order demanding documents or testimony.) Kwon said that after Elon Musk sued OpenAI \u2014 over concerns that the ChatGPT-maker has veered away from its nonprofit mission \u2014 OpenAI found it suspicious how several organizations also raised opposition to its restructuring. Encode filed an amicus brief in support of Musk\u2019s lawsuit, and other nonprofits spoke out publicly against OpenAI\u2019s restructuring.\nThere\u2019s quite a lot more to the story than this.\nAs everyone knows, we are actively defending against Elon in a lawsuit where he is trying to damage OpenAI for his own financial benefit.\nEncode, the organization for which @_NathanCalvin serves as the General Counsel, was one\u2026 https://t.co/DiBJmEwtE4 \u2014 Jason Kwon (@jasonkwon) October 10, 2025\n\u201cThis raised transparency questions about who was funding them and whether there was any coordination,\u201d said Kwon.\nNBC News reported this week that OpenAI sent broad subpoenas to Encode and six other nonprofits that criticized the company, asking for their communications related to two of OpenAI\u2019s biggest opponents, Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. OpenAI also asked Encode for communications related to its support of SB 53.\nOne prominent AI safety leader told TechCrunch that there\u2019s a growing split between OpenAI\u2019s government affairs team and its research organization. While OpenAI\u2019s safety researchers frequently publish reports disclosing the risks of AI systems, OpenAI\u2019s policy unit lobbied against SB 53, saying it would rather have uniform rules at the federal level.\nOpenAI\u2019s head of mission alignment, Joshua Achiam, spoke out about his company sending subpoenas to nonprofits in a post on X this week.\n\u201cAt what is possibly a risk to my whole career I will say: this doesn\u2019t seem great,\u201d said Achiam.\nBrendan Steinhauser, CEO of the AI safety nonprofit Alliance for Secure AI (which has not been subpoenaed by OpenAI), told TechCrunch that OpenAI seems convinced its critics are part of a Musk-led conspiracy. However, he argues this is not the case, and that much of the AI safety community is quite critical of xAI\u2019s safety practices, or lack thereof.\n\u201cOn OpenAI\u2019s part, this is meant to silence critics, to intimidate them, and to dissuade other nonprofits from doing the same,\u201d said Steinhauser. \u201cFor Sacks, I think he\u2019s concerned that [the AI safety] movement is growing and people want to hold these companies accountable.\u201d\nSriram Krishnan, the White House\u2019s senior policy advisor for AI and a former a16z general partner, chimed in on the conversation this week with a social media post of his own, calling AI safety advocates out of touch. He urged AI safety organizations to talk to \u201cpeople in the real world using, selling, adopting AI in their homes and organizations.\u201d\nA recent Pew study found that roughly half of Americans are more concerned than excited about AI, but it\u2019s unclear what worries them exactly. Another recent study went into more detail and found that American voters care more about job losses and deepfakes than catastrophic risks caused by AI, which the AI safety movement is largely focused on.\nAddressing these safety concerns could come at the expense of the AI industry\u2019s rapid growth \u2014 a trade-off that worries many in Silicon Valley. With AI investment propping up much of America\u2019s economy, the fear of over-regulation is understandable.\nBut after years of unregulated AI progress, the AI safety movement appears to be gaining real momentum heading into 2026. Silicon Valley\u2019s attempts to fight back against safety-focused groups may be a sign that they\u2019re working.\n\ntitle1:\nYour AI tools run on fracked gas and bulldozed Texas land\ndescription1:\nThe AI era is giving fracking a second act, a surprising twist for an industry that, even during its early 2010s boom years, was blamed by climate advocates for poisoned water tables, man-made earthquakes, and the stubborn persistence of fossil fuels.\nAI companies are building massive data centers near major gas-production sites, often generating their own power by tapping directly into fossil fuels. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been overshadowed by headlines about the intersection of AI and healthcare (and solving climate change), but it\u2019s one that could reshape \u2014 and raise difficult questions for \u2014 the communities that host these facilities.\nTake the latest example. This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that AI coding assistant startup Poolside is constructing a data center complex on more than 500 acres in West Texas \u2014 about 300 miles west of Dallas \u2014 a footprint two-thirds the size of Central Park. The facility will generate its own power by tapping natural gas from the Permian Basin, the nation\u2019s most productive oil and gas field, where hydraulic fracturing isn\u2019t just common but really the only game in town.\nThe project, dubbed Horizon, will produce two gigawatts of computing power. That\u2019s equivalent to the Hoover Dam\u2019s entire electric capacity, except instead of harnessing the Colorado River, it\u2019s burning fracked gas. Poolside is developing the facility with CoreWeave, a cloud computing company that rents out access to Nvidia AI chips and that\u2019s supplying access to more than 40,000 of them. The Journal calls it an \u201cenergy Wild West,\u201d which seems apt.\nYet Poolside is far from alone. Nearly all the major AI players are pursuing similar strategies. Last month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman toured his company\u2019s flagship Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas \u2014 around 200 miles from the Permian Basin \u2014 where he was candid, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re burning gas to run this data center.\u201d\nThe complex requires about 900 megawatts of electricity across eight buildings and includes a new gas-fired power plant using turbines similar to those that power warships, according to the Associated Press. The companies say the plant provides only backup power, with most electricity coming from the local grid. That grid, for the record, draws from a mix of natural gas and the sprawling wind and solar farms in West Texas.\nBut the people living near these projects aren\u2019t exactly comforted. Arlene Mendler lives across the street from Stargate. She told the AP she wishes someone had asked her opinion before bulldozers eliminated a huge tract of mesquite shrubland to make room for what\u2019s being built atop it.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

She moved to the area 33 years ago seeking \u201cpeace, quiet, tranquility.\u201d Now construction is the soundtrack in the background, and bright lights on the scene have spoiled her nighttime views.\nThen there\u2019s the water. In drought-prone West Texas, locals are particularly nervous about how new data centers will impact the water supply. The city\u2019s reservoirs were at roughly half capacity during Altman\u2019s visit, with residents on a twice-weekly outdoor watering schedule. Oracle claims each of the eight buildings will need just 12,000 gallons per year after an initial million-gallon fill for closed-loop cooling systems. But Shaolei Ren, a University of California, Riverside, professor who studies AI\u2019s environmental footprint, told the AP that\u2019s misleading. These systems require more electricity, which means more indirect water consumption at the power plants generating that electricity.\nMeta is pursuing a similar strategy. In Richland Parish, the poorest region of Louisiana, the company plans to build a $10 billion data center the size of 1,700 football fields that will require two gigawatts of power for computation alone. Utility company Entergy will spend $3.2 billion to build three large natural-gas power plants with 2.3 gigawatts of capacity to feed the facility by burning gas extracted through fracking in the nearby Haynesville Shale. Louisiana residents, like those in Abilene, aren\u2019t thrilled to be encircled by bulldozers around the clock.\n(Meta is also building in Texas, though elsewhere in the state. This week the company announced a $1.5 billion data center in El Paso, near the New Mexico border, with one gigawatt of capacity expected online in 2028. El Paso isn\u2019t near the Permian Basin, and Meta says the facility will be matched with 100% clean and renewable energy. One point for Meta.)\nEven Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, whose Memphis facility has generated considerable controversy this year, has fracking connections. Memphis Light, Gas and Water \u2014 which currently sells power to xAI but will eventually own the substations xAI is building \u2014 purchases natural gas on the spot market and pipes it to Memphis via two companies: Texas Gas Transmission Corp. and Trunkline Gas Company.\nTexas Gas Transmission is a bidirectional pipeline carrying natural gas from Gulf Coast supply areas and several major hydraulically fractured shale formations through Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Trunkline Gas Company, the other Memphis supplier, also carries natural gas from fracked sources.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why AI companies are pursuing this path, they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s not just about electricity; it\u2019s also about beating China.\nThat was the argument Chris Lehane made last week. Lehane, a veteran political operative who joined OpenAI as vice president of global affairs in 2024, laid out the case during an onstage interview with TechCrunch.\n\u201cWe believe that in the not-too-distant future, at least in the U.S., and really around the world, we are going to need to be generating in the neighborhood of a gigawatt of energy a week,\u201d Lehane said. He pointed to China\u2019s massive energy buildout: 450 gigawatts and 33 nuclear facilities constructed in the last year alone.\nWhen TechCrunch asked about Stargate\u2019s decision to build in economically challenged areas like Abilene, or Lordstown, Ohio, where more gas-powered plants are planned, Lehane returned to geopolitics. \u201cIf we [as a country] do this right, you have an opportunity to re-industrialize countries, bring manufacturing back and also transition our energy systems so that we do the modernization that needs to take place.\u201d\nThe Trump administration is certainly on board. The July 2025 executive order fast-tracks gas-powered AI data centers by streamlining environmental permits, offering financial incentives, and opening federal lands for projects using natural gas, coal, or nuclear power \u2014 while explicitly excluding renewables from support.\nFor now, most AI users remain largely unaware of the carbon footprint behind their dazzling new toys and work tools. They\u2019re more focused on capabilities like Sora 2 \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s hyperrealistic video-generation product that requires exponentially more energy than a simple chatbot \u2014 than on where the electricity comes from.\nThe companies are counting on this. They\u2019ve positioned natural gas as the pragmatic, inevitable answer to AI\u2019s exploding power demands. But the speed and scale of this fossil fuel buildout deserves more attention than it\u2019s getting.\nIf this is a bubble, it won\u2019t be pretty. The AI sector has become a circular firing squad of dependencies: OpenAI needs Microsoft needs Nvidia needs Broadcom needs Oracle needs data center operators who need OpenAI. They\u2019re all buying from and selling to each other in a self-reinforcing loop. The Financial Times noted this week if the foundation cracks, there\u2019ll be a lot of expensive infrastructure left standing around, both the digital and the gas-burning kind.\nOpenAI\u2019s ability alone to meet its obligations is \u201cincreasingly a concern for the wider economy,\u201d the outlet wrote.\nOne key question that\u2019s been largely absent from the conversation is whether all this new capacity is even necessary. A Duke University study found that utilities typically use only 53% of their available capacity throughout the year. That suggests significant room to accommodate new demand without constructing new power plants, as MIT Technology Review reported earlier this year.\nThe Duke researchers estimate that if data centers reduced electricity consumption by roughly half for just a few hours during annual peak demand periods, utilities could handle an additional 76 gigawatts of new load. That would effectively absorb the 65 gigawatts data centers are projected to need by 2029.\nThat kind of flexibility would allow companies to launch AI data centers faster. More importantly, it could provide a reprieve from the rush to build natural gas infrastructure, giving utilities time to develop cleaner alternatives.\nBut again, that would mean losing ground to an autocratic regime, per Lehane and many others in the industry, so instead, the natural gas building spree appears likely to saddle regions with more fossil-fuel plants and leave residents with soaring electricity bills to finance today\u2019s investments, including long after the tech companies\u2019 contracts expire.\nMeta, for instance, has guaranteed it will cover Entergy\u2019s costs for the new Louisiana generation for 15 years. Poolside\u2019s lease with CoreWeave runs for 15 years. What happens to customers when those contracts end remains an open question.\nThings may eventually change. A lot of private money is being funneled into small modular reactors and solar installations with the expectation that these cleaner energy alternatives will become more central energy sources for these data centers. Fusion startups like Helion and Commonwealth Fusion Systems have similarly raised substantial funding from those on the front lines of AI, including Nvidia and Altman.\nThis optimism isn\u2019t confined to private investment circles. The excitement has spilled over into public markets, where several \u201cnon-revenue-generating\u201d energy companies that have managed to go public have truly anticipatory market caps, based on the expectation that they will one day fuel these data centers.\nIn the meantime \u2014 which could still be decades \u2014 the most pressing concern is that the people who\u2019ll be left holding the bag, financially and environmentally, never asked for any of this in the first place.\n\ntitle2:\nFacebook's AI can now suggest edits to the photos still on your phone\ndescription2:\nA Facebook feature that gives Meta AI the ability to suggest edits to photos stored on your phone\u2019s camera roll but haven\u2019t yet been shared is now rolling out to all users in the U.S. and Canada. The company announced on Friday that users can choose to opt in to receive these sharing suggestions, which will then prompt them to post photos to their Facebook Feed and Stories with the AI edits.\nFirst launched as a test over the summer, Facebook\u2019s app pops up a permission dialog box requesting access to \u201callow cloud processing\u201d so users can get \u201ccreative ideas made for you from your camera roll.\u201d This box explains that the feature could offer ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling, birthday themes, and more for the end user.\nImage Credits:screenshot of Facebook's app, June 2025\nFor the AI to work, Facebook\u2019s app would upload images from your device to its cloud on an ongoing basis. This allows Meta\u2019s AI to make its suggested edits. Meta says users\u2019 media will not be used for ad targeting purposes, and it won\u2019t use the media to improve its AI systems, unless the user takes the step of editing the media or sharing the edited photos with friends or others on its social network.\nThe feature can be disabled at any time.\nThough Meta may not train its AI on all your photos, when you agree to Meta\u2019s AI Terms of Service, you permit your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. The terms say that, by processing your photos, Meta has the ability to \u201csummarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.\u201d\nThe company also uses the date and presence of people or objects in your photos to craft its creative ideas, giving Meta a lot more information about you, your relationships, and your life.\nPlus, giving Meta access to photos you haven\u2019t yet shared on Meta\u2019s platforms could give the company an advantage in the AI race by providing a wealth of user data, behavioral insights, and ideas for new AI features.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Its estimates indicate that new user growth, measured by percentage changes in new global downloads, slowed after April.\nThe firm looked at the global daily active user (DAU) growth and found that the numbers have begun to even out over the past month or so.\nGlobal DAUs for ChatGPT mobile app. Image Credits:Apptopia\nAlthough October is only half over, the firm says it\u2019s on pace to be down 8.1% in terms of a month-over-month percentage change in global downloads.\nTo be clear, this is a look at download growth, not total downloads. In terms of sheer number of new installs, ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app is still doing well, with millions of downloads per day.\nMonth-over-month change in downloads, worldwide.\nHowever, seeing the download growth stall can suggest that an app\u2019s overall pace of growth is slowing. In ChatGPT\u2019s case, increased competition and changes to its AI model\u2019s characteristics could be to blame.\nDiving in deeper, other metrics indicate that average time spent per DAU in the U.S., specifically, has dropped 22.5% since July, and average sessions per DAU in the U.S. are also down by 20.7%.\nThis indicates that U.S. users are spending less time in ChatGPT\u2019s app and are opening it fewer times per day. User churn in the U.S. has also dropped and stabilized during this time, indicating that the app is now retaining its core users and seeing fewer who just drop by briefly to experiment, then abandon the app.\nOpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.\nImage Credits:Apptopia\nBeyond simply reaching its peak, there are other factors that could have played a role here. That includes not only competition from Google\u2019s Gemini, but also user engagement changes following an April update that was designed to make the chatbot\u2019s AI model less sycophantic. This continued with the August release of GPT-5, which was said to be less personable, as well.\nHowever, Apptopia notes that ChatGPT\u2019s average time spent per DAU and average sessions per DAU metrics were trending downward before the sharp rise of its competitor, Google\u2019s Gemini, which shot up to the top charts in September thanks to the release of Google\u2019s new AI image model, Nano Banana.\nSo while Gemini\u2019s growth may have influenced some of the more recent drops in ChatGPT\u2019s core metrics, it doesn\u2019t explain the overall trend, the firm says.\nImage Credits:Apptopia\nPlus, Apptopia points out that if only average time spent per DAU was dropping, but not average sessions per DAU, it could have suggested that people were getting more efficient with their ChatGPT queries. But since both are on the decline, that\u2019s not the case.\nInstead, Apptopia says it\u2019s possible that the experimentation phase with the ChatGPT app is over, and now it\u2019s becoming a part of users\u2019 daily routines. People are likely using the app when they need it or remember to use it, as compared with the increased use it saw when it was still new.\nFor OpenAI, that means the company will have to invest in app marketing or release new features for it to boost some of these core metrics again, just as other established mobile apps have to do. It can no longer rely on novelty alone to provide growth.\n\ntitle4:\nStellantis teams up with Pony AI to develop robotaxis in Europe\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAutomaker Stellantis and Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony.ai have signed a nonbinding agreement to build robotaxis for deployment in Europe.\nThe collaboration will integrate Pony\u2019s self-driving software into Stellantis\u2019 electric medium-size van platform, which is built with advanced sensors to support autonomous vehicles.\nThe companies plan to first deploy test vehicles based on the Peugeot e-Traveller model.
