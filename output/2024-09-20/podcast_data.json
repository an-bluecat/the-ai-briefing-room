Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday September 23), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nQualcomm recently approached Intel about a possible takeover\ndescription0:\nQualcomm recently approached struggling chipmaker Intel about a takeover, CNBC has confirmed.\nIt wasn't clear if Intel had engaged in conversations with Qualcomm or what the terms would be, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the information was confidential.\nThe Wall Street Journal was first to report on the matter. Intel shares initially popped on the news before closing up about 3%, while Qualcomm shares fell about 3% at the close.\nThe deal, if it were to happen, would be one of the largest technology mergers ever. Intel has a market cap of over $90 billion.\nOnce the world's largest chipmaker, Intel has for years been in a downward spiral that accelerated in 2024. The stock had its biggest one-day drop in over 50 years in August after the company reported disappointing earnings. Intel shares are down 53% this year as investors express doubts about the company's costly plans to manufacture and design chips.\nQualcomm and Intel compete in several markets, including for PC and laptop chips. However, Qualcomm, unlike Intel, doesn't manufacture its own chips, and instead relies on firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung to handle production.\nOn Monday, after a board meeting to discuss strategy, Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger sent a memo to staff that reiterated the company's commitment to investing heavily in its foundry business, a project that could cost $100 billion over the next five years. It also said that it was weighing outside investment.\nIntel has also missed out on the artificial intelligence boom that's captured the attention of Wall Street. Most of the advanced AI programs, such as ChatGPT, run on Nvidia graphics processors, instead of Intel central processors. Nvidia has more than 80% of the fast-growing market, according to analysts.\nQualcomm generates less revenue than Intel. It reported $35.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2023, compared with Intel's $54.2 billion during the same period.\nA potential deal would be complicated by antitrust and national security matters. Both Intel and Qualcomm do business in China, and both have seen deals scuttled by Chinese antitrust enforcers. Intel was unsuccessful with its attempted acquisition of Tower Semiconductor, as was Qualcomm in its bid to acquire NXP Semiconductor.\nOther giant acquisitions in the space have also been scuttled. In 2017, Broadcom made a bid to buy Qualcomm for more than $100 billion. The Trump administration blocked the deal the following year on national security concerns, because Broadcom was based in Singapore at the time. And in 2021, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block Nvidia's attempted purchase of Arm on antitrust grounds. The deal was called off in 2022 following additional pressure from regulators in Europe and Asia.\nRepresentatives for Qualcomm and Intel declined to comment.\n\ntitle1:\nApple releases iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4\ndescription1:\nIn this article AAPL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nwatch now\nApple on Friday greeted customers at its stores around the world for the debuts of the iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and AirPods 4. The new products were announced at an event earlier this month and have been available for pre-order since Sept. 13. The company lit up the glass cube at its Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City, in a nod to the enhanced Siri, which will light up the borders of the new iPhone's screen when that feature rolls out next month. Apple's fresh iPhones mark the company's latest move into artificial intelligence, with new Apple Intelligence features that will begin to launch in October. The new features will allow customers to rewrite text, remove objects from photos and speak with an improved Siri. The software advancements will only be available on iPhone 16 and last year's iPhone 15 Pro devices.\nA view of Apple's new iPhone 16 at an Apple Store on the Regent Street in London, United Kingdom on September 20, 2024. Rasid Necati Aslim | Anadolu | Getty Images\nBut Apple shares slid on Monday after analyst reports suggested that demand for the latest iPhones was lower than expected. TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note on Monday that first-weekend sales were down about 12% year over year from the iPhone 15 last year. Barclays, JPMorgan and Bank of America also noted shipping times could translate to lighter demand for the more expensive iPhone Pro models compared with last year. CNBC's Steve Kovach spoke with CEO Tim Cook outside Apple's Fifth Avenue store and asked whether sales looked better or worse than last year. \"I don't know yet. It's only the first hour, so we'll see,\" Cook said. On Friday, UBS analysts suggested investors shouldn't overreact to what appears to be lighter sales because that data is also collected by analyzing the wait times for new iPhone models and that those were longer last year due in part to supply chain disruptions.\nApple Store Fifth Avenue in New York Steve Kovach| CNBC\n\"Ahead of the iPhone 16 announcement, our analysis suggested that a lack of a killer app and arguably somewhat half-baked introduction of Apple Intelligence would dampen demand,\" the UBS analysts wrote. \"While we still argue the collection of iPhone/iOS attributes are more evolutionary than revolutionary, we caution that investors not overreact to data that suggests somewhat initial tepid demand.\" The UBS analysts said supply chain disruptions last year \"slightly distorted/extended last year's data,\" which led to longer wait times for customers for Pro models. Last year, UBS wrote, customers had a 41-day wait time for some iPhone 15 Pro Max pre-orders compared with a 26-day wait time for the iPhone 16 Pro Max this year. \"Nevertheless, data across all models and regions roughly a week post launch support our view that a super-cycle is not imminent as US and China data on the margin is disappointing relative to last year,\" they wrote.\nDevices of the new Apple Watch Series 10 model are on display after the presentation at Apple headquarters.

CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty Images\nAlibaba on Thursday released more than 100 open-source artificial intelligence models and boosted the capabilities of its proprietary technology as it looks to ramp up competition with rivals. The newly-released models, known as Qwen 2.5, are designed for use in applications and sectors ranging from automobiles to gaming and science research, Alibaba said. They have more advanced capabilities in math and coding, it added. The Hangzhou-headquartered firm is looking to increase competition with domestic rivals such as Baidu and Huawei, as well as U.S. titans like Microsoft and OpenAI.\nAI models are trained on huge amounts of data. Alibaba says its models have the ability to understand prompts and generate texts and images. Open-source means that anyone \u2014 including researchers, academics and companies \u2014 around the world can use the models to create their own generative AI apps without needing to train their own systems, saving time and expense. By open sourcing the models, Alibaba hopes more users will use its AI. The Chinese e-commerce giant first launched its Tongyi Qianwen, or Qwen, model last year. Since then, it has released improved versions and says that, to date, its open source models have been downloaded 40 million times. The company also said that it upgraded its proprietary flagship model called Qwen-Max, which is not open-source. Instead, Alibaba sells its capabilities through its cloud computing products to businesses. Alibaba said that Qwen Max 2.5-Max surpassed rivals such as Meta 's Llama and OpenAI's GPT4 in several areas including reasoning and language comprehension. Alibaba also launched a new text-to-video tool based on its AI models. This allows users to input a prompt and the AI will create a video based on it. This is similar to OpenAI's Sora. \"Alibaba Cloud is investing, with unprecedented intensity, in the research and development of AI technology and the building of its global infrastructure,\" Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba, said in a statement.\nwatch now\n\ntitle3:\nElon Musk threatened with SEC sanctions for failing to appear in court\ndescription3:\nElon Musk, the CEO of X and various other companies with the letter \u201cX\u201d in their names, is in regulators\u2019 crosshairs after skipping testimony this month in an investigation related to Musk\u2019s takeover of Twitter.\nIn a filing today, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said that it intended to seek sanctions against Musk after Musk skipped a court-ordered appearance in a Los Angeles courthouse on September 10. Per the filing, Musk didn\u2019t notify the SEC that he wouldn\u2019t be appearing until just three hours before his testimony was set to begin.\n\u201cThe Court must make clear that Musk\u2019s gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,\u201d the filing reads.\nMusk instead spent September 10 overseeing the launch of Polaris Dawn, a spacecraft made by his space exploration company, SpaceX, according to the filing.\nThe SEC\u2019s legal counsel offered to reschedule Musk\u2019s hearing to the following day, September 11. But Musk\u2019s attorney declined, agreeing only to court dates in October.\nThe SEC is seeking \u201cmeaningful conditional relief\u201d if Musk doesn\u2019t appear in court in October. The agency also signaled that it plans to file a sanctions motion against Musk to recoup its travel costs for the canceled testimony and other relief. (In the filing, the SEC said that it spent \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d to fly three attorneys to Los Angeles for the September 10 hearing.)\nMusk\u2019s court-mandated appearance stems from the SEC\u2019s probe looking into whether the billionaire followed the law when disclosing his purchases of Twitter stock before acquiring the company for $44 billion in 2022. The probe also seeks to uncover whether Musk\u2019s statements concerning the deal were misleading; the SEC alleges that Musk waited at least 10 days too long to disclose he was buying Twitter shares.\nThe probe is the second time Musk has been under the SEC\u2019s gun in recent years. In 2018, the agency ordered Musk to step down as Tesla\u2019s chairman and pay $40 million in penalties over tweets related to Tesla shares that the SEC found to be market-manipulating. At the time, Musk called the fraud charges an \u201cunjustified action.\u201d\nThe SEC has also investigated Musk and Tesla over claims regarding Tesla vehicles\u2019 \u201cfull self-driving\u201d capabilities, as well as Tesla\u2019s use of company funds to build Musk a \u201cglass house.\u201d\nYou can read the full filing below.\nUpdated 9/20 at 5:48 p.m. Pacific: We originally wrote that Musk failed to appear in a San Francisco courtroom. The courtroom was in fact in Los Angeles; we\u2019ve made the correction and regret the error.\nJOINT STATEMENT REGARDING R\u2026 by SP-TechCrunch\n\ntitle4:\nThe 25 battery tech startups that just got a piece of $3B in federal funds\ndescription4:\nThe federal government is handing out another $3 billion to startups in the buzzy battery tech sector.\nThe investment, which the Biden administration announced Friday, is the latest injection of capital to come from a $16 billion pot that the Department of Energy set aside to build out local battery manufacturing, processing, and recycling facilities. It\u2019s part of the broader Inflation Reduction Act, which passed into law in August 2022 and includes incentives to boost the domestic battery industry and reduce reliance on the world\u2019s battery incumbent, China.\nThis tranche of funding went to startups across 14 states, but there were certain winners that will see the bulk of the expected 18,000 jobs to be created as a result of this funding. South Carolina companies secured the most funding, with five projects being awarded $850 million. For example, Cirba Solutions grabbed a $200 million bag to build, own, and operate a facility to process large-scale battery-grade salts to support the electric vehicle market.\nFour Michigan companies snagged a total $355 million in grant money. General Motors-backed Mitra Chem got $100 million from the DOE and another $25 million from the state of Michigan\u2019s Competitiveness Fund. The company will partner with Sun Chemical to build a facility that will develop and manufacture lithium-iron phosphate materials for electric vehicles and battery storage systems.\nThe DOE also awarded venture-backed battery recycling startup Ascend Elements $125 million, alongside chemical manufacturing company Orbia, to build a recycled graphite production facility in Kentucky that converts graphite residue from lithium-ion battery recycling and cathode material production into battery-grade graphite.\nThe loans and grants will go to companies working across the battery supply chain, from critical mineral extraction to production of cathode and anode materials, from electrolyte salt production to battery recycling.\nHere\u2019s a list of all of the startups that have secured funds:\"\n\nResponse:",
