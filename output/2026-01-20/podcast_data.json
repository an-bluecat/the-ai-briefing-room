Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday January 21), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOne-time hot insurance tech Ethos poised to be first tech IPO of the year\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nEthos Technologies has priced its initial public offering and the expectation is that it will go public on Thursday, making it one of the first tech IPOs of the year.\nIf it lands in its current price range of $18 to $20 a share, it will enter the day valued at $1.26 billion on the high end \u2014 raising $102.6 million for itself and about $108 million for its selling shareholders. Should investor interest be high, it could wind up pricing higher. That means a bigger valuation and more money raised.\nThe company, which offers software to sell life insurance, is backed by Sequoia, Accel, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm GV, SoftBank, General Catalyst, and Heroic Ventures. Sequoia and Accel are not selling shares in the IPO, the company disclosed.\nEthos was a rising startup star in the pre-AI era, raising one big round after another through 2021. In its early rounds, it was backed by a who\u2019s who of family offices, including those of Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Durant, and Jay-Z, the company told TechCrunch in 2018.\nIt hit a $2.7 billion valuation in 2021 having raised $400 million by then, most of it that year. It completed only very small fundraises after that, PitchBook estimates.\nEthos is profitable and has been for years, its IPO documents disclose. In the nine months ending September 30, Ethos generated almost $278 million in revenue and just under $46.6 million in net income.\n\ntitle1:\nX open sources its algorithm while facing a transparency fine and Grok controversies\ndescription1:\nIn 2023, the website then known as Twitter partially open sourced its algorithm for the first time. In those days, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk had only recently acquired the platform, and he claimed to be on a mission to restructure the social media platform to make it more transparent.\nHowever, the algorithm\u2019s code release was swiftly critiqued for being \u201ctransparency theater,\u201d with critics noting that it was \u201cincomplete,\u201d and that it didn\u2019t reveal much about the inner workings of the organization, or why the code worked the way that it did.\nNow the site (rebranded as X) has open sourced its algorithm again, fulfilling a promise made by Musk last week. \u201cWe will make the new \ud835\udd4f algorithm, including all code used to determine what organic and advertising posts are recommended to users, open source in 7 days,\u201d he\u2019d said. Musk also promised to provide transparency into the algorithm every four weeks for the foreseeable future.\nIn a post on GitHub on Tuesday, X provided an accessible write-up about its feed-generating code, along with a diagram of how the program works.\nWhat has been revealed isn\u2019t particularly earth-shattering \u2014 but it does provide a peek behind the algorithmic curtain. The diagram shows that, when sifting about for content to feed a particular user, the site\u2019s algorithm considers their engagement history (what posts they\u2019ve clicked on, etc.) and surveys recent in-network posts. It also conducts a machine-learning-based analysis of \u201cout-of-network\u201d posts \u2014 as in, content from accounts that the user doesn\u2019t necessarily follow \u2014 that it believes the user might also find appealing.\nImage Credits:Screenshot\nThe algorithm then filters out certain kinds of posts, including ones that come from blocked accounts or that are associated with muted keywords, as well as content that has been deemed too violent or spam-like. The algorithm then ranks this content based on what it thinks the user will find most appealing. This process considers factors like relevance and content diversity so users don\u2019t just get a bunch of posts that are all alike. The algorithm also considers content according to the likelihood that the user will like it, reply to it, repost it, favorite it, or otherwise engage with it in some way.\nImage Credits:Screenshot\nThis whole system is AI-based, according to X. The GitHub write-up released Tuesday notes that the system \u201crelies entirely\u201d on the company\u2019s \u201cGrok-based transformer\u201d to \u201clearn relevance from user engagement sequences.\u201d In other words, Grok is looking at what you\u2019re clicking and liking and feeding that information into the recommendation system. The write-up also notes that there is no \u201cmanual feature engineering for content relevance,\u201d meaning humans don\u2019t manually adjust how the algorithm determines what\u2019s relevant. It adds that the automation \u201csignificantly reduces the complexity in our data pipelines and serving infrastructure.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nWhy is X revealing all of this now? It\u2019s not totally clear. In the past, Musk has claimed that he wants to make the platform an exemplar of corporate transparency \u2014 a theme that continues to today. In 2023, when the Twitter algorithm was first revealed, Musk said that providing \u201ccode transparency\u201d would be \u201cincredibly embarrassing at first\u201d but would ultimately \u201clead to rapid improvement in recommendation quality.\u201d He added: \u201cMost importantly, we hope to earn your trust.\u201d With its first code open sourcing, the platform proclaimed a \u201cnew era of transparency\u201d for Twitter.\nThough Musk has talked transparency, certain aspects of the platform have arguably grown less open since Musk took it over. When the tech billionaire bought Twitter in 2022, the site was notably forced to transition from a public company to a private one \u2014 an evolution that isn\u2019t typically synonymous with openness. While the site used to release multiple transparency reports a year, X didn\u2019t release its first transparency report until September of 2024. In December, X was also fined $140 million by European Union regulators who claimed that the site had violated \u201ctransparency obligations\u201d under the Digital Services Act (DSA), and argued that the site\u2019s verification check mark system had made it more difficult for users to judge the authenticity of particular accounts.\nX has also been under pressure over the past month due to the ways in which its chatbot, Grok, have been used to create and distribute sexualized content. The California Attorney General\u2019s office and congressional lawmakers have both scrutinized the platform in recent weeks, citing claims that Grok has been used to create naked images of women and minors. As a result, some may view this appeal to openness as just more theater.\n\ntitle2:\nNetflix to redesign its app as it competes with social platforms for daily engagement\ndescription2:\nAs YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram continue to dominate mobile viewing, Netflix is rethinking how its app fits into a social-first video landscape. During its fourth-quarter earnings call on Tuesday, the company announced plans to revamp its mobile app and expand its short-form video feature, which it mentions could help promote the new slate of original video podcasts it unveiled last week.\nSet to launch later in 2026, Netflix\u2019s redesigned mobile app is intended to \u201cbetter serve the expansion of our business over the decade to come,\u201d according to co-CEO Greg Peters. The update will act as a foundation for ongoing experimentation, allowing the company to \u201citerate, test, evolve, and improve\u201d its offering over time.\nAt the center of the redesign is deeper integration of vertical video feeds, which the streaming giant has been experimenting with since May. The feed displays short clips from Netflix shows and movies in a format familiar to TikTok and Instagram Reels users.\n\u201cYou can imagine us bringing more clips based on new content types, like video podcasts,\u201d Peters remarked during the earnings call, further signaling that Netflix sees swipeable short-form clips as a powerful tool for capturing attention and increasing time spent in the app.\nNetflix is also making a significant push into video podcasts \u2014 a sector where YouTube has long been the leader. This week, Netflix debuted its first original video podcasts, including shows hosted by high-profile personalities such as Pete Davidson and Michael Irvin. The company has also partnered with major podcast players to bring established video podcast libraries to the platform, including tie-ups with Spotify and iHeartMedia.\nBoth of these moves signal a broader effort to make content discovery and daily engagement on Netflix feel more like a social platform experience. At the same time, Netflix has been careful to position its strategy as experimentation rather than imitation. Speaking at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference, CTO Elizabeth Stone emphasized that the company isn\u2019t trying to become TikTok, but rather to strengthen its entertainment discovery capabilities through mobile-first features.\nDuring the earnings call, co-CEO Ted Sarandos reflected on the wider shift in the streaming industry: services are no longer competing only with one another, but with the entire entertainment industry.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been more competition for creators, for consumer attention, for advertising and subscription dollars, the competitive lines around TV consumption are already blurring,\u201d Sarandos said. \u201cTV is not what we grew up on. TV is now just about everything. The Oscars and the NFL are on YouTube\u2026Apple\u2019s competing for Emmys and Oscars, and Instagram is coming next.\u201d\nSarandos also commented on Netflix\u2019s evolving film strategy, referencing the company\u2019s recent shift in its theatrical release strategy as it prepares to acquire Warner Bros. This signals an openness to hybrid distribution models, as the line between cinema, streaming, and social content continues to blur.\nIn 2025, Netflix delivered $45.2 billion in revenue, with ad revenue rising to over $1.5 billion. Additionally, Netflix crossed the 325 million paid subscriptions milestone in the fourth quarter.\n\ntitle3:\nElon Musk says Tesla\u2019s restarted Dojo3 will be for \u2018space-based AI compute\u2019\ndescription3:\nElon Musk said over the long weekend that Tesla aims to restart work on Dojo3, the electric vehicle company\u2019s previously abandoned third-generation AI chip. Only this time, Dojo3 won\u2019t be aimed at training self-driving models on Earth. Instead, Musk says it will be dedicated to \u201cspace-based AI compute.\u201d\nThe move comes five months after Tesla effectively shut down its Dojo effort. The company disbanded the team behind its Dojo supercomputer following the departure of Dojo lead Peter Bannon. Around 20 Dojo workers also left to join DensityAI, a new AI infrastructure startup founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\nAt the time of Dojo\u2019s shutdown, Bloomberg reported Tesla planned to increase its reliance on Nvidia and other partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing, rather than continue developing its own custom silicon. Musk\u2019s latest comments suggest the strategy has shifted again.\nThe billionaire executive and Republican megadonor said in a post on X the decision to revive Dojo was based on the state of its in-house chip roadmap, noting that Tesla\u2019s AI5 chip design was \u201cin good shape.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s AI5 chip, made by TSMC, was designed to power the automaker\u2019s automated driving features and Optimus humanoid robots. Last summer, Tesla signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to build its AI6 chips that promise to power Tesla vehicles and Optimus, as well as enable high-performance AI training in data centers.\n\u201cAI7/Dojo3 will be for space-based AI compute,\u201d Musk said on Sunday, positioning the resurrected project as more of a moonshot.\nTo achieve that, Tesla is now gearing up to rebuild the team it dismantled months ago. Musk used the same post to recruit engineers directly, writing: \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in working on what will be the highest volume chips in the world, send a note to AI_Chips@Tesla.com with 3 bullet points on the toughest technical problems you\u2019ve solved.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

At CES 2026, Nvidia unveiled Alpamayo, an open source AI model for autonomous driving that directly challenges Tesla\u2019s FSD software. Musk commented on X that solving the long tail of rare edge cases in driving is \u201csuper hard,\u201d adding: \u201cI honestly hope they succeed.\u201d\nMusk and several other AI executives have argued the future of data centers may lie off-planet, since Earth\u2019s power grids are already strained to the max. Axios recently reported Musk rival and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also excited by the prospect of putting data centers into orbit. Musk has an edge over his peers because he already controls the launch vehicles.\nPer Axios, Musk plans to use SpaceX\u2019s upcoming IPO to help finance his vision of using Starship to launch a constellation of compute satellites that can operate in constant sunlight, harvesting solar power 24/7.\nStill, there are many roadblocks to making AI data centers in space a possibility, not least the challenge of cooling high-power compute in a vacuum. Musk\u2019s comments of Tesla building \u201cspace-based AI compute\u201d fit a familiar pattern: float an idea that sounds far-fetched, then try to brute-force it into reality.\n\ntitle4:\nIn an effort to protect young users, ChatGPT will now predict how old you are\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAs concern for AI\u2019s impact on young people continues to mount, OpenAI has introduced an \u201cage prediction\u201d feature into ChatGPT that is designed to help identify minors and put sensible content constraints on their conversations.\nOpenAI has been heavily criticized in recent years for the impacts that ChatGPT can have on children. A number of teen suicides have been linked to the chatbot, and, like other AI vendors, OpenAI has also been criticized for allowing ChatGPT to discuss sexual topics with young users. Last April, the company was forced to address a bug that allowed its chatbot to generate erotica for users who were under the age of 18.\nThe company has already been working on its underage user problem for some time, and its new \u201cage prediction\u201d feature merely adds to protections already in place. The new feature leverages an AI algorithm that assesses user accounts for particular \u201cbehavioral and account-level signals,\u201d in an effort to identify young users, OpenAI said in a blog post Tuesday.\nThose \u201csignals\u201d include things like the user\u2019s stated age, the length of time an account has existed, and the times of day that the account is usually active, the company said. The company already has content filters designed to weed out discussions of sex, violence, and other potentially problematic topics for users who are under age 18. If the age prediction mechanism identifies an account as under 18, those filters are automatically applied.\nIf a user is mistakenly designated as underage, there is a way for them to reestablish their \u201cadult\u201d account. They can submit a selfie to OpenAI\u2019s ID verification partner Persona, OpenAI says.\"\n\nResponse:",
