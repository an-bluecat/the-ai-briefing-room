Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The company has been helped along by the strong demand for AI chips, particularly from Nvidia, as well as ever-improving smartphone semiconductors.\n\"TSMC has benefited significantly from the strong demand for AI,\" Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC.\nWang said \"capacity utilization\" for TSMC's 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer processes \u2014 the most advanced chips \u2014 \"has consistently exceeded 100%.\"\nAI graphics processing units (GPUs), such as those designed by Nvidia, and other artificial intelligence chips are driving this demand, Wang said.\nTaiwan-listed shares of TSMC have risen 88% over the last 12 months.\nTSMC's latest sales figures may also give hope to investors that the the demand for artificial intelligence chips and services may continue into 2025.\nFoxconn , which assembles Apple's iPhones, reported its highest-ever fourth quarter revenue this week, as it notched strong demand for AI servers.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft this month said that it plans to spend $80 billion in its fiscal year to June on the construction of data centers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads.\nCNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta DEI programs are being canceled. Read the memo\ndescription1:\nMeta on Friday told employees that its plans to end a number of internal programs designed to increase the company's hiring of diverse candidates, the latest dramatic change ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second White House term.\nJanelle Gale, Meta's vice president of people, made the announcement on the company's Workplace internal communications forum.\nAmong the changes, Meta is ending the company's \"Diverse Slate Approach\" of considering qualified candidates from underrepresented groups for its open roles. The company is also putting an end to its diversity supplier program and its equity and inclusion training programs.\nGale also announced the disbanding of the company's diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, team, and she said that Meta Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams will move into a new role focused on accessibility and engagement.\nSeveral Meta employees responded to Gale's post with comments criticizing the new policy.\n\"If you don't stand by your principles when things get difficult, they aren't values. They're hobbies,\" one employee posted in a comment that got reaction from more than 600 colleagues.\nThe DEI policy change follows a number of sweeping policy reversals by the social media company this month. Last week, Meta replaced global affairs head Nick Clegg with Joel Kaplan, a veteran at the company with longstanding ties to the Republican Party. On Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg announced a new speech policy that included bringing an end to the company's third-party fact-checking program.\nAxios was first to report the DEI changes at the social media company. Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBelow is Gale's full internal memo, which CNBC obtained.\nHi all,\nI wanted to share some changes we're making to our hiring, development, and procurement practices. Before getting into details, there is some important background to lay out:\nThe legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing. The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI. It reaffirms long standing principles that discrimination should not be tolerated or promoted on the basis of inherent characteristics. The term \"DEI\" has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others.\nAt Meta, we have a principle of serving everyone. This can be achieved through cognitively diverse teams, with differences in knowledge, skills, political views, backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences. Such teams are better at innovating, solving complex problems and identifying new opportunities which ultimately helps us deliver on our ambition to build products that serve everyone. On top of that, we've always believed that no one should be given \u2014 or deprived \u2014 of opportunities because of protective characteristics, and that has not changed.\nGiven the shifting legal and policy landscape, we're making the following changes:\nOn hiring, we will continue to source candidates from different backgrounds, but we will stop using the Diverse Slate Approach. This practice has always been subject to public debate and is currently being challenged. We believe there are other ways to build an industry leading workforce and leverage teams made up of world-class people from all types of backgrounds to build products that work for everyone.\nWe previously ended representation goals for women and ethnic minorities. Having goals can create the impression that decisions are being made based on race or gender. While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.\nWe are sunsetting our supplier diversity effort within our broader supplier strategy. This effort focused on sourcing from diverse-owned businesses; going forward, we will focus our efforts on supporting small and medium sized businesses that power much of our economy. Opportunities will continue to be available to all qualified suppliers, including those who are part of the supplier diversity program.\nInstead of equity and inclusion training programs, we will build programs that focus on how to apply fair and consistent practices that mitigate bias for all, no matter your background.\nWe will no longer have a team focused on DEI. Maxine Williams is taking on a new role at Meta focused on accessibility and engagement.\nWhat remains the same are the principles we've used to guide our People Practices:\nWe serve everyone. We are committed to making our products accessible, beneficial and universally impactful for everyone. We build the best teams with the most talented people. This means sourcing people from a range of candidate pools but never making hiring decisions based on protected characteristics, (e.g., race, gender, etc.). We will always evaluate people as individuals. We drive consistency in employment practices to ensure fairness and objectivity for all. We do not provide preferential treatment, extra opportunities or unjustified credit to anyone based on protected characteristics. Nor will we devalue impact based on these characteristics. We build connection and community. We support our employee communities, people who use our products and those in the communities. We operate our employee community groups (MRGs) continue to be open to all.\nMeta has the privilege to serve billions of people every day. It is important to us that our products are accessible to all, and useful in promoting economic growth and opportunity around the world. We continue to be focused on serving everyone and building a multi-talented, industry-leading workforce from all walks of life.\nWATCH: Meta is returning to free speech tradition, says Facebook's former chief privacy officer Chris Kelly\n\ntitle2:\nTikTok ban likely to be upheld by Supreme Court\ndescription2:\nwatch now\nThe Supreme Court on Friday heard oral arguments in the case involving the future of TikTok in the United States, and a law that could effectively ban the popular app as soon as next week. The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act targets TikTok and will impose harsh civil penalties on app \"entities\" that carry the service after a Jan.19 deadline. Among several issues the justices considered was whether the law violates the Constitution's free speech protections. During the over two-hour long argument, justices repeatedly questioned TikTok's head lawyer about the social media platform's ties to the People's Republic of China. And they seemed generally unconvinced by TikTok's main argument, that the law violates the free speech rights of its millions of individual users in the United States. Still, questions remain about president-elect Donald Trump's willingness to enforce the law once he assumes office, just a day after it goes into effect. If Trump decides not to enforce violations, third-party service providers like Apple and Google will face a dilemma: Whether to follow the letter of the law or put their trust in the new administration's assurances that they can effectively ignore it. Cornell University law professor Gautam Hans said in a statement that \"the consensus that the Court will allow the ban to go into effect seems correct.\" \"What remains unfortunate is the credulity with which many of the justices treated this law, which clearly implicates free speech rights on underspecified national security grounds,\" Hans said.\nTikTok's argument\nNoel Francisco, the U.S. solicitor general during president-elect Donald Trump's first term, opened the hearing as TikTok's legal representative. He echoed Trump's desire for the court to halt the effective ban, in order to give Trump time to find a political resolution to the national security concerns over TikTok.\nwatch now\nThe justices peppered Francisco with questions about TikTok's ties to China-based ByteDance, which owns the social media service, and interrogated TikTok's first-amendment argument against the law. Much of the court's line of inquiry focused on the ownership-structure of TikTok. When Justice Samuel Alito asked Francisco whether he would make the same argument if TikTok was directly owned by the Chinese government, the TikTok lawyer said he would not. But Francisco also insisted that Beijing does not force TikTok to make content decisions. \"We absolutely resist any kind of content manipulation by China at all,\" said Francisco. His careful use of the word \"resist,\" rather than, for example, \"reject\" was noted by court watchers. O'Melveny & Myers special counsel Jeffrey Fisher argued on behalf of the TikTok content creators who are challenging the law.\nIn the interest of national security, \"Congress can prohibit Americans ... from associating with terrorist organizations,\" said Fisher. But the \"government just doesn't get to come in and say 'national security' and the case is over.\" \"You have to dig underneath what is the national security claim,\" Fisher said.\nThe government's case\nMuch of the argument in support of the TikTok divesture law so far centers around the claim that TikTok indeed poses a national security threat. This was at the heart of U.S. solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar's argument. Americans using TikTok may believe \"they are speaking to one another,\" Prelogar said. But in reality, \"the PRC, a foreign adversary nation, is instead exploiting a vulnerability in the system.\" The justices pressed Prelogar on how TikTok differs from other foreign-owned outlets, like Politico and the Oxford University Press. \"China is a foreign adversary nation that looks for every opportunity it has to weaken the United States,\" she said. \"If it has control over [TikTok], it's hard to predict exactly how it's going to use that as a tool to harm our interests.\" \"But we know it's going to try,\" Prelogar said. \"What we're trying to prevent is not the specific subject matter, the specific viewpoints, but the technical capability of a foreign adversary nation to use a communications channel,\" Prelogar said.\nwatch now\nRegarding whether the incoming Trump administration could extend the deadline before the law is enacted, Prelogar said that the U.S. government has not yet taken a position on that. \"We have not run it to ground, in part because it's simply not presented here,\" Prelogar said. Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, and the deadline for divestiture is Jan. 19. Regarding whether president-elect Trump can choose to not enforce the law, Prelogar said that \"raises a tricky question.\" It's unclear when the court will hand down a decision, and if China's ByteDance continues to refuse to divest TikTok to an American company, it faces a complete ban nationwide.\nWhat are the potential impacts on users?\nThe roughly 115 million U.S. TikTok monthly active users could face a range of scenarios depending on when the Supreme Court hands down a decision. If no word comes before the law takes effect on Jan. 19 and the ban goes through, it's possible that users would still be able to post or engage with the app if they already have it downloaded. However, those users would likely be unable to update or redownload the app after that date, multiple legal experts said. Thousands of short-form video creators who generate income from TikTok through ad revenue, paid partnerships, merchandise and more will likely need to transition their businesses to other platforms, like YouTube or Instagram. \"Shutting down TikTok, even for a single day, would be a big deal, not just for people who create content on TikTok, but everyone who shares or views content,\" said George Wang, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute who helped write the institute's amicus briefs on the case. \"It sets a really dangerous precedent for how we regulate speech online,\" Wang said.\nWhat comes next?\nIt's unclear when the Supreme Court will issue its ruling, but the case's expedited hearing has some predicting that the court could issue a quick ruling. The case will have \"enormous implications\" because TikTok's user base in the U.S. is so large, said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law. \"It's unprecedented for the government to prohibit platforms for speech, especially one so many people use,\" Chemerinsky said. \"Ultimately, this is a tension between free speech issues on the one hand and claims of national security on the other.\" \"There are valid reasons to have concerns about privacy and data collection,\" said Hans, of Cornell.\n\"But this law specifically targets one platform in ways that should make us all unsettled about whether future government action could target other speech platforms.\" WATCH: It appears TikTok could really get shut down, says Jim Cramer\n\ntitle3:\nMicrosoft accuses group of developing tool to abuse its AI service in new lawsuit\ndescription3:\nMicrosoft has taken legal action against a group the company claims intentionally developed and used tools to bypass the safety guardrails of its cloud AI products.\nAccording to a complaint filed by the company in December in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a group of 10 unnamed defendants allegedly used stolen customer credentials and custom-designed software to break into the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft\u2019s fully managed service powered by ChatGPT maker OpenAI\u2019s technologies.\nIn the complaint, Microsoft accuses the defendants \u2014 who it refers to only as \u201cDoes,\u201d a legal pseudonym \u2014 of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and a federal racketeering law by illicitly accessing and using Microsoft\u2019s software and servers for the purpose to \u201ccreate offensive\u201d and \u201charmful and illicit content.\u201d Microsoft did not provide specific details about the abusive content that was generated.\nThe company is seeking injunctive and \u201cother equitable\u201d relief and damages.\nIn the complaint, Microsoft says it discovered in July 2024 that customers with Azure OpenAI Service credentials \u2014 specifically API keys, the unique strings of characters used to authenticate an app or user \u2014 were being used to generate content that violates the service\u2019s acceptable use policy. Subsequently, through an investigation, Microsoft discovered that the API keys had been stolen from paying customers, according to the complaint.\n\u201cThe precise manner in which Defendants obtained all of the API Keys used to carry out the misconduct described in this Complaint is unknown,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s complaint reads, \u201cbut it appears that Defendants have engaged in a pattern of systematic API Key theft that enabled them to steal Microsoft API Keys from multiple Microsoft customers.\u201d\nMicrosoft alleges that the defendants used stolen Azure OpenAI Service API keys belonging to U.S.-based customers to create a \u201chacking-as-a-service\u201d scheme. Per the complaint, to pull off this scheme, the defendants created a client-side tool called de3u, as well as software for processing and routing communications from de3u to Microsoft\u2019s systems.\nDe3u allowed users to leverage stolen API keys to generate images using DALL-E, one of the OpenAI models available to Azure OpenAI Service customers, without having to write their own code, Microsoft alleges. De3u also attempted to prevent the Azure OpenAI Service from revising the prompts used to generate images, according to the complaint, which can happen, for instance, when a text prompt contains words that trigger Microsoft\u2019s content filtering.\nA screenshot of the De3u tool from the Microsoft complaint. Image Credits:Microsoft\nA repo containing de3u project code, hosted on GitHub \u2014 a company that Microsoft owns \u2014 is no longer accessible at press time.\n\u201cThese features, combined with Defendants\u2019 unlawful programmatic API access to the Azure OpenAI service, enabled Defendants to reverse engineer means of circumventing Microsoft\u2019s content and abuse measures,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cDefendants knowingly and intentionally accessed the Azure OpenAl Service protected computers without authorization, and as a result of such conduct caused damage and loss.\u201d\nIn a blog post published Friday, Microsoft says that the court has authorized it to seize a website \u201cinstrumental\u201d to the defendants\u2019 operation that will allow the company to gather evidence, decipher how the defendants\u2019 alleged services are monetized, and disrupt any additional technical infrastructure it finds.\nMicrosoft also says that it has \u201cput in place countermeasures,\u201d which the company didn\u2019t specify, and \u201cadded additional safety mitigations\u201d to the Azure OpenAI Service targeting the activity it observed.\n\ntitle4:\nTesla launches refreshed Model Y in China to fend off domestic rivals\ndescription4:\nTesla's Model Y refresh comes after the auto giant this month reported its first ever annual decline in overall deliveries for 2024 .\nA spokesperson for Tesla China said that the new Model Y is only open for pre-sale in the Chinese market, rather than being launched globally.\nThe Model Y will start at 263,500 Chinese yuan ($35,935), with deliveries set to begin in March. That is 5.4% more expensive than the starting price of the previous Model Y.\nTesla on Friday announced a revamped version of its popular Model Y in China, as the U.S. electric car giant looks to fend off challenges from domestic rivals.\nElon Musk's electric vehicle firm is facing heightened competition around the world, from startups and traditional carmakers in Europe. In China, the company continues to face an onslaught of rivals from BYD to newer players like Xpeng and Nio .\nJason Low, principal analyst at Canalys, notes that the Tesla Model Y was the best-selling EV in China in 2024 and that the popularity of the car \"remains high.\" However, he noted that the competition in the sports utility vehicle (SUV) segment with vehicles priced between 250,000 yuan and 350,000 yuan \"has been fierce.\"\n\"Tesla must showcase compelling smart features, particularly a unique but well localized cockpit and services ecosystem,\" as well as \"effective\" semi-autonomous driver assistance features \"to ensure its competitiveness in the market,\" Low added.\nTesla is offering a number of incentives for customers to buy the Model Y including a five-year 0% interest financing plan.\nThe new Model Y can accelerate from 0 kilometers per hour to 100 kilometers per hour in 4.3 seconds, Tesla said, exceeding the speed capabilities of the previous vehicle. The Model Y Long Range has a further driving range on a single charge versus its predecessor.\nTesla has not introduced a new model since it began delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, which starts at nearly $80,000.\nInvestors have been yearning for a new mass-market model to reinvigorate sales. Tesla has previously hinted that that a new affordable model could be launched in the first half of 2025.\nDespite Tesla's headwinds, the company's stock is up nearly 70% over the last 12 months, partly due to CEO Musk's close relationship with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.\"\n\nResponse:",
