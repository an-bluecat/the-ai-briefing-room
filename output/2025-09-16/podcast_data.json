Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The cells were made by an unnamed third-party supplier. Despite the fires, no injuries have been reported, the ACCC said in a recall notice.\nThe Powerwall 2 contains 14 kWh of lithium ion batteries, and its usually installed alongside solar panels to store excess power generated during the day.\nCustomers can also enroll their batteries in a virtual power plant to support the grid in times of heavy load. Enrolling extends the warranty to up to 15 years and gives customers access to time-of-use rates that will help reduce energy bills, Tesla says.\nHomeowners will be notified in the Tesla app if their Powerwall is part of the recall, and the company is in the process of discharging the batteries to reduce the risk of fire. Recalled batteries will be replaced free of charge, and the company \u201cwill consider compensation for lost energy savings \u2026 on a case-by-case basis,\u201d the ACCC said.\n\ntitle1:\nSame-day delivery comes to space, as Impulse promises satellite transport in hours, not months\ndescription1:\nAmazon made same-day delivery the benchmark on Earth. Impulse Space is pitching a similar concept for satellites bound for geostationary orbit about 22,000 miles above Earth, compressing what is typically a months-long transit into a matter of hours.\nIn the span of a week, the in-space propulsion startup announced a trio of deals aiming to unlock geostationary orbit (GEO) for commercial and defense users. That includes a demonstration mission with defense contractor Anduril planned for 2026; a transportation deal with GEO communications startup Astranis in 2027; and a multi-launch agreement to carry Infinite Orbits\u2019 servicing satellites to GEO starting the same year.\nTom Mueller founded Impulse in 2021 after nearly two decades leading propulsion at SpaceX, where he led development of the Merlin and Raptor engines. He left SpaceX in 2020 and started Impulse to build out in-space transport services focused on last-mile delivery in low Earth orbit (LEO) \u2014 which is typically 100 to 1,200 miles above Earth \u2014 and ultra-fast satellite transport to GEO.\nThe common denominator across these missions is Helios, Impulse\u2019s methane-oxygen kick stage. A kick stage is essentially a small rocket engine system that rides on a larger rocket and then fires its own engine \u2013 in this case, a powerful engine called Deneb \u2013 to propel spacecraft to their final destination.\nHelios is meant to be the \u201csame day\u201d courier from LEO to higher altitude orbits. If it performs as advertised, commercial operators could reach higher orbits much faster, and the Department of Defense could maneuver more quickly in an increasingly contested region of space.\nGEO isn\u2019t just far away. Getting there and operating satellites from there presents special challenges. Spacecraft must transit the high-radiation Van Allen belts \u2014 zones of charged particles trapped by Earth\u2019s magnetic field \u2014 deal with latency in long-distance communication, and maintain their precise position.\nThe partnership between Anduril and Impulse could prove especially lucrative. The pair will jointly build a demo satellite for rendezvous and proximity operations \u2014 a capability that allows spacecraft to approach and inspect other objects in orbit \u2014 which the Space Force has identified as critical for space domain awareness and deterrence.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

That mission profile is super valuable to Astranis, as it will allow the company to dramatically accelerate satellite activation dates for customers waiting for their satellite broadband services here on Earth.\nFinally, Impulse signed a multi-launch agreement with France\u2019s Infinite Orbits to carry several satellite servicing spacecraft to GEO via a ride-share program called Caravan. Impulse says the Caravan offering will deliver multiple small satellites at the same time, much as SpaceX\u2019s ride-share program lets companies split the cost of a launch. The first Caravan mission is fully booked for 2026, Impulse said.\nIn recent years, the space industry\u2019s explosive growth has mostly focused on LEO as operators shifted to smaller, less expensive satellites for applications in communications and remote sensing. But if Impulse has its way, the next phase of growth will be in GEO.\n\ntitle2:\nWhat to know about TikTok\u2019s uncertain future in the US and the people who want to buy it\ndescription2:\nTikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.\nEarlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\nA number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app, and if a deal were to go through, the platform\u2019s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research\u2019s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.\nFollowing extensive discussions and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, it seems that progress has been made. This week, a \u201cframework\u201d deal was reportedly established between the U.S. and China, with new information revealed indicating that a consortium of investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz, may oversee TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.\nTikTok ban: What\u2019s happened so far\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives, in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok. On April 23, 2024, the Senate passed the bill.\nShortly after, President Joe Biden signed the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\nTrump has a change of heart\nOn December 27, 2024, Trump opposed the potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as \u201cthe TikTok ban.\u201d TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.\nTikTok shuts down \u2026 then comes back online\nAlthough TikTok indeed shut itself down in the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn\u2019t last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. The platform noted, \u201cAs a result of President Trump\u2019s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.\u201d\nWhere we are today\nOn January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nIn early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups that are interested in buying the platform, per Reuters. More recently, The Information reported that Trump intends to announce TikTok America, a company backed by American investors that owns around 50% of U.S. operations. ByteDance would reportedly own 19.9%.\nAs of now, no definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.\nBelow is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly, Elon Musk is not among them.)\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok is a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The listing comes comes just over a year after the company restructured its corporate headquarters from Delaware back to India \u2014 a move that could make it the first Indian startup to list at home following a relocation from the U.S.\nBacked by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and marquee investors including Y Combinator, Ribbit Capital, and Tiger Global, Groww\u2019s listing \u2014 expected later this year \u2014 is set to double as a major exit opportunity for global venture funds. The three investment firms are offloading about 236 million shares \u2014 roughly 5.6% of Groww\u2019s total equity base \u2014 per the draft IPO documents filed on Tuesday. That makes them the single largest selling bloc, accounting for about 41% of all shares being offered to the public.\nPine Labs, Razorpay, Meesho, and Zepto are among the Indian startups that have recently shifted their base back home. Walmart-backed PhonePe relocated its headquarters from Singapore to India in 2022, while Flipkart \u2014 once its parent and also backed by Walmart \u2014 similarly announced plans to move its headquarters from Singapore to India earlier this year.\nLast year, Groww became one of the first startups to shift its headquarters back to India from the U.S. The startup paid around $159 million in taxes as part of the move.\nRelocating their base back home helps startups align with evolving local regulations and meet requirements for domestic stock listings. It also makes sense to tap India\u2019s public markets, given the expanding retail investor base and rising appetite for IPOs. The trend reflects the growing maturity and attractiveness of India\u2019s capital markets compared to overseas alternatives.\nWhile U.S. investors plan to offload a large chunk of their holdings in Groww, founders Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain, Neeraj Singh, and Ishan Bansal together are selling only about 4 million shares \u2014 only 0.7% of the total offer for sale, per the draft prospectus.\nThe small sale signals that Groww\u2019s founders are holding on to nearly all their equity, in contrast to the established investors who are using the IPO as an exit route.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The IPO is expected to value the Bengaluru-based company at $9 billion.\nIn the fiscal year ending March 31, Groww reported total income of \u20b940.6 billion (about $462 million), up 45% year-on-year, with profit after tax of \u20b918.2 billion (roughly $208 million). The startup had posted a net loss of about \u20b98 billion (around $92 million) in the previous year, primarily due to expenses tied to its Delaware headquarters relocation.\nAs of June, Groww had about 37.4 million individual demat accounts (digital accounts that hold securities electronically), representing nearly 19% of India\u2019s market, along with 12.6 million active clients on the National Stock Exchange, equal to a 26% share. The platform also counted around 17 million active systematic investment plans (SIPs, which are recurring monthly investments) and 9 million unique mutual fund investors, becoming the only investment app in the country to surpass 100 million cumulative downloads.\nThe offering is being advised by JPMorgan Chase, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Citigroup, Axis Bank and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors.\n\ntitle4:\nSilicon Valley bets big on 'environments' to train AI agents\ndescription4:\nFor years, Big Tech CEOs have touted visions of AI agents that can autonomously use software applications to complete tasks for people. But take today\u2019s consumer AI agents out for a spin, whether it\u2019s OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Agent or Perplexity\u2019s Comet, and you\u2019ll quickly realize how limited the technology still is. Making AI agents more robust may take a new set of techniques that the industry is still discovering.\nOne of those techniques is carefully simulating workspaces where agents can be trained on multi-step tasks \u2014 known as reinforcement learning (RL) environments. Similarly to how labeled datasets powered the last wave of AI, RL environments are starting to look like a critical element in the development of agents.\nAI researchers, founders, and investors tell TechCrunch that leading AI labs are now demanding more RL environments, and there\u2019s no shortage of startups hoping to supply them.\n\u201cAll the big AI labs are building RL environments in-house,\u201d said Jennifer Li, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBut as you can imagine, creating these datasets is very complex, so AI labs are also looking at third party vendors that can create high quality environments and evaluations. Everyone is looking at this space.\u201d\nThe push for RL environments has minted a new class of well-funded startups, such as Mechanize and Prime Intellect, that aim to lead the space. Meanwhile, large data-labeling companies like Mercor and Surge say they\u2019re investing more in RL environments to keep pace with the industry\u2019s shifts from static datasets to interactive simulations. The major labs are considering investing heavily too: according to The Information, leaders at Anthropic have discussed spending more than $1 billion on RL environments over the next year.\nThe hope for investors and founders is that one of these startups emerge as the \u201cScale AI for environments,\u201d referring to the $29 billion data labelling powerhouse that powered the chatbot era.\nThe question is whether RL environments will truly push the frontier of AI progress.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWhat is an RL environment?\nAt their core, RL environments are training grounds that simulate what an AI agent would be doing in a real software application. One founder described building them in recent interview \u201clike creating a very boring video game.\u201d\nFor example, an environment could simulate a Chrome browser and task an AI agent with purchasing a pair of socks on Amazon. The agent is graded on its performance and sent a reward signal when it succeeds (in this case, buying a worthy pair of socks).\nWhile such a task sounds relatively simple, there are a lot of places where an AI agent could get tripped up. It might get lost navigating the web page\u2019s drop down menus, or buy too many socks. And because developers can\u2019t predict exactly what wrong turn an agent will take, the environment itself has to be robust enough to capture any unexpected behavior, and still deliver useful feedback. That makes building environments far more complex than a static dataset.\nSome environments are quite elaborate, allowing for AI agents to use tools, access the internet, or use various software applications to complete a given task. Others are more narrow, aimed at helping an agent learn specific tasks in enterprise software applications.\nWhile RL environments are the hot thing in Silicon Valley right now, there\u2019s a lot of precedent for using this technique. One of OpenAI\u2019s first projects back in 2016 was building \u201cRL Gyms,\u201d which were quite similar to the modern conception of environments. The same year, Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo AI system beat a world champion at the board game, Go. It also used RL techniques within a simulated environment.\nWhat\u2019s unique about today\u2019s environments is that researchers are trying to build computer-using AI agents with large transformer models. Unlike AlphaGo, which was a specialized AI system working in a closed environments, today\u2019s AI agents are trained to have more general capabilities. AI researchers today have a stronger starting point, but also a complicated goal where more can go wrong.\nA crowded field\nAI data labeling companies like Scale AI, Surge, and Mercor are trying to meet the moment and build out RL environments. These companies have more resources than many startups in the space, as well as deep relationships with AI labs.\nSurge CEO Edwin Chen tells TechCrunch he\u2019s recently seen a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in demand for RL environments within AI labs. Surge \u2014 which reportedly generated $1.2 billion in revenue last year from working with AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and Meta \u2014 recently spun up a new internal organization specifically tasked with building out RL environments, he said.\nClose behind Surge is Mercor, a startup valued at $10 billion, which has also worked with OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic. Mercor is pitching investors on its business building RL environments for domain specific tasks such as coding, healthcare, and law, according to marketing materials seen by TechCrunch.\nMercor CEO Brendan Foody told TechCrunch in an interview that \u201cfew understand how large the opportunity around RL environments truly is.\u201d\nScale AI used to dominate the data labeling space, but has lost ground since Meta invested $14 billion and hired away its CEO. Since then, Google and OpenAI dropped Scale AI as a data provider, and the startup even faces competition for data labelling work inside of Meta. But still, Scale is trying to meet the moment and build environments.\n\u201cThis is just the nature of the business [Scale AI] is in,\u201d said Chetan Rane, Scale AI\u2019s head of product for agents and RL environments. \u201cScale has proven its ability to adapt quickly. We did this in the early days of autonomous vehicles, our first business unit. When ChatGPT came out, Scale AI adapted to that. And now, once again, we\u2019re adapting to new frontier spaces like agents and environments.\u201d\nSome newer players are focusing exclusively on environments from the outset. Among them is Mechanize, a startup founded roughly six months ago with the audacious goal of \u201cautomating all jobs.\u201d However, co-founder Matthew Barnett tells TechCrunch that his firm is starting with RL environments for AI coding agents.\nMechanize aims to supply AI labs with a small number of robust RL environments, Barnett says, rather than larger data firms that create a wide range of simple RL environments. To this point, the startup is offering software engineers $500,000 salaries to build RL environments \u2014 far higher than an hourly contractor could earn working at Scale AI or Surge.\nMechanize has already been working with Anthropic on RL environments, two sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Mechanize and Anthropic declined to comment on the partnership.\nOther startups are betting that RL environments will be influential outside of AI labs. Prime Intellect \u2014 a startup backed by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy, Founders Fund, and Menlo Ventures \u2014 is targeting smaller developers with its RL environments.\nLast month, Prime Intellect launched an RL environments hub, which aims to be a \u201cHugging Face for RL environments.\u201d The idea is to give open-source developers access to the same resources that large AI labs have, and sell those developers access to computational resources in the process.\nTraining generally capable agents in RL environments can be more computational expensive than previous AI training techniques, according to Prime Intellect researcher Will Brown. Alongside startups building RL environments, there\u2019s another opportunity for GPU providers that can power the process.\n\u201cRL environments are going to be too large for any one company to dominate,\u201d said Brown in an interview. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re doing is just trying to build good open-source infrastructure around it. The service we sell is compute, so it is a convenient onramp to using GPUs, but we\u2019re thinking of this more in the long term.\u201d\nWill it scale?\nThe open question around RL environments is whether the technique will scale like previous AI training methods.\nReinforcement learning has powered some of the biggest leaps in AI over the past year, including models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4. Those are particularly important breakthroughs because the methods previously used to improve AI models are now showing diminishing returns.\nEnvironments are part of AI labs\u2019 bigger bet on RL, which many believe will continue to drive progress as they add more data and computational resources to the process. Some of the OpenAI researchers behind o1 previously told TechCrunch that the company originally invested in AI reasoning models \u2014 which were created through investments in RL and test-time-compute \u2014 because they thought it would scale nicely.\nThe best way to scale RL remains unclear, but environments seem like a promising contender. Instead of simply rewarding chatbots for text responses, they let agents operate in simulations with tools and computers at their disposal. That\u2019s far more resource-intensive, but potentially more rewarding.\nSome are skeptical that all these RL environments will pan out. Ross Taylor, a former AI research lead with Meta that co-founded General Reasoning, tells TechCrunch that RL environments are prone to reward hacking. This is a process in which AI models cheat in order to get a reward, without really doing the task.\n\u201cI think people are underestimating how difficult it is to scale environments,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cEven the best publicly available [RL environments] typically don\u2019t work without serious modification.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s Head of Engineering for its API business, Sherwin Wu, said in a recent podcast that he was \u201cshort\u201d on RL environment startups. Wu noted that it\u2019s a very competitive space, but also that AI research is evolving so quickly that it\u2019s hard to serve AI labs well.\nKarpathy, an investor in Prime Intellect that has called RL environments a potential breakthrough, has also voiced caution for the RL space more broadly. In a post on X, he raised concerns about how much more AI progress can be squeezed out of RL.\n\u201cI am bullish on environments and agentic interactions but I am bearish on reinforcement learning specifically,\u201d said Karpathy.\nUpdate: A previous version of this article referred to Mechanize as Mechanize Work. It has been updated to reflect the company\u2019s official name.\"\n\nResponse:",
