Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

AWS re:Invent 2024 kicks off in Las Vegas on Sunday, with sessions scheduled to run through December 6. A keynote address featuring AWS CEO Matt Garman will take place December 3, starting at 8 a.m. PT sharp.\nAWS plans to make a livestream of the keynote available on YouTube, and we\u2019ll be covering everything that\u2019s announced onstage. Keep your eyes peeled for that, as well as for our stories popping up throughout the course of re:Invent.\nNotably, this is Garman\u2019s first re:Invent as AWS\u2019 CEO. His predecessor, Adam Selipsky, stepped down in May after just three years at the helm.\nSo what can we expect?\nGarman must deal with a market perception that AWS continues to trail Microsoft and Google in the generative AI race. AWS has introduced a number of generative AI services in recent months, and the company claims that its revenue from generative AI has reached \u201cmultiple billions\u201d of dollars.\nIn another win, AWS just weeks ago shored up its partnership with Anthropic by becoming the AI company\u2019s primary model training partner, and by agreeing to have Anthropic\u2019s team help guide its future AI chip design efforts.\nBut AWS has also faced setbacks, like the departure of top AI exec Matt Wood and delays of its flagship Olympus model.\nGarman will almost certainly talk about generative AI during his keynote. (The re:Invent catalog lists over 500 generative AI-related sessions.) But he told TechCrunch in October that re:Invent wouldn\u2019t be \u201cjust an AI conference\u201d this year.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have innovations across the stack in compute and storage and databases and analytics and AI,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be across the whole stack of AWS.\u201d\nExpect a cameo from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy during Garman\u2019s keynote, the theme of which Amazon rather bombastically describes as \u201chighlighting how AWS is reinventing foundational building blocks as well as developing new experiences to empower customers and partners with what they need to build a better future.\u201d\nAWS VP Swami Sivasubramanian will give an AI- and data-focused presentation on new AWS services on December 4 . And December 5, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels will dive deep into his tech predictions for the coming year \u2014 a longtime regular fixture of re:Invent.\nSivasubramanian and Vogels\u2019 speeches, like Garman\u2019s, will be streamed on YouTube \u2014 and we\u2019ll be covering them right here on TechCrunch.\n\ntitle1:\nSpaceX gets FCC green light for Starlink direct-to-phone deal with T-Mobile\ndescription1:\nThe FCC has granted SpaceX permission to go forward with plans to offer a direct-to-phone version of its Starlink satellite internet service, with T-Mobile as its provider and a few provisos in place.\nThe proposal dates to summer 2022, when SpaceX and T-Mobile first announced that they were pursuing the ability for the mobile provider\u2019s customers to get Starlink access on their phones. At the time, they said they expected the service to start in 2023, but here we are at the end of 2024 and it\u2019s only just now getting regulatory approval.\nStill, it\u2019s a coup for Starlink, which will get its foot in the door in the US market before its rivals, including existing direct-to-phone satellite provider Lynk, which is already in orbit but has no US commercial partners. SpaceX will be able to use certain wireless bands, in close partnership with T-Mobile as the terrestrial operator, to allow customers with compatible devices to communicate.\nBut as the leaders of the companies pointed out at the announcement, it\u2019s more than just getting approval and turning on the service. Non-trivial engineering problems must be solved to sync a phone up with a cell \u201ctower\u201d that\u2019s actually on a satellite hundreds of miles away and going thousands of miles per hour. But they appear to have figured this part out: the company demonstrated a video call six months ago, and as the FCC notes, direct-to-phone connections were allowed during hurricanes Helene and Milton to allow disconnected areas better access to emergency services.\nThe FCC states in its filing (first reported by Bloomberg) that the upside is clear:\nWe find that SpaceX and T-Mobile\u2019s SCS operations will yield many benefits, including an increase in access to emergency services in areas where consumers would otherwise not have the capability to access a terrestrial network to call or text 911, as evidenced, for example, through SpaceX\u2019s provision of emergency SCS in areas affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nThere are a few limitations on how this type of service (which the FCC calls \u201csupplemental coverage from space,\u201d or SCS) can work. Right now it officially has to operate as an extension of an existing terrestrial provider, in this case T-Mobile. That\u2019s because the regulations on how you broadcast stuff in space are different from those for how you broadcast stuff to and from a phone (as opposed to a base station antenna). AT&T, for its part, is partnering with AST SpaceMobile.\nSpaceX must also be sure that its service does not interfere with other services on the ground, while the ground services do not have to worry about whether they might interfere with the satellite signals.\nAs for latency and signal power, every kilometer of altitude matters \u2014 and Starlink is up at the 530 km level. Fortunately for SpaceX, the FCC has authorized it to operate any of the remainder of its 7,500 approved satellites at altitudes of 340, 345, 350, and 360 kilometers. Those in the know will have noticed that this is rather close to the lower limit of the International Space Station\u2019s orbit (370 kilometers) \u2014 and indeed, SpaceX will need to coordinate any deployment below 400 km with NASA.\nIt is notable, reading through the filing, how many notional competitors to Starlink \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Kuiper, DISH, Omnispace, TerreStar, and more \u2014 filed objections to its applications, no doubt to delay it. This is not to say that their objections are without substance, but the FCC was clearly not convinced by many of them, or was happy to let SpaceX cure its applications with the appropriate remedies.\nBefore long, \u201cno signal\u201d will be a thing of the past \u2014 and fortunately, many of those involved in this space tend to favor universal access for emergencies and the like, rather than privileged access for streaming Netflix at Burning Man. That said, nothing in the filing indicates when SpaceX and T-Mobile will bring the service online or at what cost.\n\ntitle2:\nUber is building a fleet of gig workers to label data for AI models\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nUber is expanding its fleet of gig workers and creating a new category: AI annotation and data labeling.\nThe ride-hailing company has started hiring contractors for a new AI and data labeling division called Scaled Solutions. These workers complete projects for Uber\u2019s internal business units but are also serving outside customers including self-driving vehicle company Aurora Innovation and video game developer Niantic, according to reporting from Bloomberg.\nUber has started recruiting contractors in countries including the U.S., Canada, and India, among others, Bloomberg reported.\nUber\u2019s move into data labeling comes as that market has become increasingly hot, thanks to the rise of AI. For example, Scale AI is one company in the sector seeing increased demand. The company raised a $1 billion round at a $13.8 billion valuation earlier this year after only raising $600 million prior in its eight-year history.\n\ntitle3:\nIntel finalizes $7.9 billion CHIPS Act grant\ndescription3:\nChipmaker Intel and the CHIPS and Science Act office finalized a $7.86 billion grant, the government announced Tuesday, as the Biden administration moves to dole out funds before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.\nThat $8 billion will go toward Intel's factory-building efforts. The topline number is lower than the Initially announced $8.5 billion grant, a haircut that senior administration officials said was because Intel's $3 billion contract with the Department of Defense came from CHIPS Act funds.\nThat deal was announced in September, a rare bright spot in the company's struggling efforts to grow its fab business.\n\"Thanks to the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, our CHIPS award is enabling Intel to drive one of the most significant semiconductor manufacturing expansions in U.S. history,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a release.\n\"Intel is deeply committed to advancing these shared priorities as we further expand our U.S. operations over the next several years,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in the release.\nCNBC earlier reported that the two sides were close to finalizing the grant.\nThe U.S. awarded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. a $6.6 billion grant earlier this month, raising investor expectations that cash funding for Intel would come soon. Intel has benefited from CHIPS tax breaks but had not yet received cash awards, something which Gelsinger has expressed dissatisfaction with.\n\"We're frustrated that hasn't moved faster,\" Gelsinger told CNBC in October, referring to the CHIPS grants. \"They've been too bureaucratic in that process. We're anxious to see those finished.\"\nIntel's struggles have intensified since the grant was initially announced. The New York Times, citing four people familiar with the matter, reported Sunday that the government had decided to decrease the grant by roughly $500 million due to uncertainties about Intel's ability to execute on its investment commitment, and because of Intel's shifting technology road map and customer demand. Senior administration officials said the reduced award did not have anything to do with issues at Intel.\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had previously said he might look to repeal the bipartisan legislation, but he then walked back those comments. The Biden administration and grant awardees have touted the legislation as a job-creating machine.\nIntel's struggles have increased significantly this year. The company posted a nearly $17 billion loss last quarter and has been dialing back Gelsinger's ambitious plans worldwide.\nIntel announced earlier this year it would trim 15,000 jobs via layoffs and voluntary buyouts. It has made moves to make its foundry business more easily separable from its legacy business, and has been working with advisors on activist defense and a broader strategic review, people familiar with the matter previously said. Intel is also seeking to raise cash via a minority stake in the Altera business, CNBC previously reported, and has been sounding out interested acquirers for weeks.\nCNBC's Megan Cassella contributed to this report.\n\ntitle4:\nRussia-linked hackers exploited Firefox and Windows bugs in 'widespread' hacking campaign\ndescription4:\nSecurity researchers have uncovered two previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited by RomCom, a Russian-linked hacking group, to target Firefox browser users and Windows device owners across Europe and North America.\nRomCom is a cybercrime group that is known to carry out cyberattacks and other digital intrusions for the Russian government. The group \u2014 which was last month linked to a ransomware attack targeting Japanese tech giant Casio \u2014 is also known for its aggressive stance against organizations allied with Ukraine, which Russia invaded in 2014.\nResearchers with security firm ESET say they found evidence that RomCom combined use of the two zero-day bugs \u2014 described as such because the software makers had no time to roll out fixes before they were used to hack people \u2014 to create a \u201czero click\u201d exploit, which allows the hackers to remotely plant malware on a target\u2019s computer without any user interaction.\n\u201cThis level of sophistication demonstrates the threat actor\u2019s capability and intent to develop stealthy attack methods,\u201d ESET researchers Damien Schaeffer and Romain Dumont said in a blog post on Monday.\nRomCom\u2019s targets would have to visit a malicious website controlled by the hacking group in order to trigger the zero-click exploit. Once exploited, RomCom\u2019s eponymous backdoor would be installed on the victim\u2019s computer, allowing broad access to a victim\u2019s device.\nSchaeffer told TechCrunch that the number of potential victims from RomCom\u2019s \u201cwidespread\u201d hacking campaign ranged from a single victim per country to as many as 250 victims, with the majority of targets based in Europe and North America.\nMozilla patched the vulnerability in Firefox on October 9, a day after ESET alerted the browser maker. The Tor Project, which develops the Tor Browser based on Firefox\u2019s codebase, also patched the vulnerability; though Schaeffer told TechCrunch that ESET has seen no evidence that the Tor Browser was exploited during this hacking campaign.\nMicrosoft patched the vulnerability affecting Windows on November 12. Security researchers with Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed cyberattacks and threats, reported the bug to Microsoft, suggesting that the exploit may have been used in other government-backed hacking campaigns.\"\n\nResponse:",
