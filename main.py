"I'm Steve Kovach, and this is your tech Briefing for Tuesday March 23rd. AMD revealing today its latest AI chips. The new chips will be for so-called AI PCs, or PCs with special processors, for tasks like real-time language translation, or using tools like Microsoft's Copilot Assistant more efficiently. Last month, Intel put its latest AI PC chip in Microsoft's new Surface computer lineup, and Qualcomm is expected to put its chips in PCs starting next month. Sticking with AI, Microsoft announcing today a $1.5 billion investment in G42, a startup based in the United Arab Emirates. As part of the deal, G42 will use Microsoft's Azure Cloud to run its AI applications, and Microsoft President Brad Smith will join the company's board. Microsoft has made several foreign AI and cloud investments so far this year. Some examples include the company said it would open a headquarters in London, invest in the French startup Mistral, and invest $2.9 billion in AI infrastructure in Japan. Now over to China. Baidu, the Chinese search company, announced its AI chatbot ErnieBot has surpassed 200 million users. ErnieBot launched last year, and other companies like Samsung and Honor have integrated Ernie into their devices. Apple is reportedly going to partner with Baidu as well to help power new AI features in devices sold in China. That's all from today. We'll see you back here tomorrow."
