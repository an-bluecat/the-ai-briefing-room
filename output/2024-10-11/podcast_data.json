The tools aim to help health-care organizations build AI applications quicker and save clinicians time on administrative tasks, a major cause of industry burnout. Nurses spend as much as 41% of their time on documentation, according to a report from the Office of the Surgeon General. \"By integrating AI into health care, our goal is to reduce the strain on medical staff, foster the collective health team collaboration, enhance the overall efficiency of healthcare systems across the country,\" Mary Varghese Presti, vice president of portfolio evolution and incubation at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences, said in a prerecorded briefing with reporters. The new tools are the latest example of Microsoft's efforts to establish itself as a leader in health-care AI. Last October, the company unveiled a series of health features across its Azure cloud and Fabric analytics platform. It also acquired Nuance Communications, which offers speech-to-text AI solutions for health care and other sectors, in a $16 billion deal in 2021. Many of the solutions Microsoft announced on Thursday are in the early stages of development or only available in preview. Health-care organizations will test and validate them before the company rolls them out more broadly. Microsoft declined to share what these new tools will cost. Health-care AI models\nMicrosoft's model catalog Courtesy of Microsoft\nRoughly 80% of hospital and health system visits include an imaging exam because doctors often rely on images to help treat patients. Microsoft is launching a collection of open-source multimodal AI models that can analyze data types beyond just text, such as medical images, clinical records and genomic data. Health-care organizations can use the models to build new applications and tools. For example, digitizing a single pathology slide can require more than a gigabyte of storage, so many existing AI pathology models have trained on small pieces of slides at a time. Microsoft and Providence Health & Services built a whole-slide model that improves on mutation prediction and cancer subtyping, according to a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature. Now, health systems can build on it and fine-tune it to meet their needs. \"Getting a whole-slide foundation model for pathology has been a challenge in the past \u2026 and now we're actually able to do it,\" Sara Vaezy, chief strategy and digital officer at Providence, told CNBC in an interview. \"It was really sort of a game changer.\" The models are available in the model catalog within Azure AI Studio, which serves as Microsoft's generative AI development hub. Health-care agent service\nMicrosoft's health-care agent service. Courtesy of Microsoft\nMicrosoft also announced a new way for health systems to build AI agents. AI agents vary in complexity, but they can help users answer questions, automate processes and perform specific tasks. Through Microsoft Copilot Studio, these organizations can create agents equipped with health-care-specific safeguards. When an answer contains a reference to clinical evidence, for instance, the source is shown, and a note indicates if the answer is AI-generated. Fabrications and omissions are also flagged, Microsoft said. For example, a health-care organization could build an AI agent to help doctors identify relevant clinical trials for a patient. Microsoft said a physician could type the question, \"What clinical trials for a male 55-year-old with diabetes and interstitial lung disease?\" and receive a list of potential options. It would save the doctor the time and effort of finding each trial. AI agents that can help patients answer basic questions have been popular among the health systems that have already begun testing the service, Hadas Bitran, general manager of health AI at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences, said in a Q&A with reporters. Agents that can help doctors answer questions about recent guidelines and patients' history are also common, she added. Microsoft's health-care agent service is available in a preview capacity starting Thursday. Bringing automated documentation to nurses\nwatch now\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia-backed CoreWeave picks up $650 million credit line\ndescription1:\nIn this photo illustration, a Core Weave logo is displayed on a smartphone with stock market percentages on the background.\nCoreWeave, an Nvidia -backed artificial intelligence startup that rents out chips to other companies, announced Friday that it has a new $650 million credit line to expand its business and data center portfolio.\nThe cloud infrastructure company said it's raised $12.7 billion from equity and debt investors in the past 18 months, including a $1.1 billion round in May at a $19 billion valuation.\nBy the end of 2024, CoreWeave plans to have 28 data centers across the U.S. and abroad \u2014 including locations in Austin, Texas, Chicago, Las Vegas and London \u2014 and it plans to build another 10 data centers in 2025. In the past, CoreWeave has supplied Microsoft and French AI startup Mistral with graphics processing units, or GPUs.\nAs of last year, CoreWeave reportedly had $2 billion in revenue under contract lined up for 2024.\nAI models are notoriously expensive to build and train, requiring thousands of specialized chips that, to date, have largely come from Nvidia. Most, if not all, tech companies that are power players in AI spend between hundreds of thousands and billions of dollars on Nvidia chips to make their models work. And in addition to developing the chips, Nvidia has taken stakes in emerging AI companies like CoreWeave, partly as a way to make sure its technology gets widely deployed.\nGoldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley led the financing CoreWeave announced Friday, with participation from Barclays, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Jefferies, Mizuho, MUFG and Wells Fargo.\n\"This credit facility provides additional liquidity to accelerate our growth strategy and capitalize on new opportunities in the rapidly evolving AI space,\" Mike Intrator, CoreWeave's co-founder and CEO, said in a press release.\nCoreWeave's new credit line is part of a broader trend, as banks are positioning themselves for a slice of the AI gold rush ahead of a number of potential IPOs in the space. The generative AI market is poised to top $1 trillion in revenue by 2032, according to one estimate.\nLast week, OpenAI received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion. The news came just after OpenAI closed its latest funding round at a $157 billion valuation.\nMany of the same banks contributed to OpenAI's credit line. The startup has an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion.\nCoreWeave declined to provide details about the interest rate it's paying or the timeframe for the credit facility.\n\ntitle2:\nAMD launches AI chip to rival Nvidia's Blackwell\ndescription2:\nLisa Su, chairwoman and CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), delivers the opening keynote speech at Computex 2024, Taiwan's premier tech expo, in Taipei on June 3, 2024.\nAMD launched a new artificial intelligence chip on Thursday that is taking direct aim at Nvidia's data center graphics processors, known as GPUs.\nThe Instinct MI325X, as the chip is called, will start production before the end of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices said Thursday during an event announcing the new product. If AMD's AI chips are seen by developers and cloud giants as a close substitute for Nvidia's products, it could put pricing pressure on Nvidia, which has enjoyed roughly 75% gross margins while its GPUs have been in high demand over the past year.\nAdvanced generative AI such as OpenAI's ChatGPT requires massive data centers full of GPUs in order to do the necessary processing, which has created demand for more companies to provide AI chips.\nIn the past few years, Nvidia has dominated the majority of the data center GPU market, but AMD is historically in second place. Now, AMD is aiming to take share from its Silicon Valley rival or at least to capture a big chunk of the market, which it says will be worth $500 billion by 2028.\n\"AI demand has actually continued to take off and actually exceed expectations. It's clear that the rate of investment is continuing to grow everywhere,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su said at the event.\nAMD didn't reveal new major cloud or internet customers for its Instinct GPUs at the event, but the company has previously disclosed that both Meta and Microsoft buy its AI GPUs and that OpenAI uses them for some applications. The company also did not disclose pricing for the Instinct MI325X, which is typically sold as part of a complete server.\nWith the launch of the MI325X, AMD is accelerating its product schedule to release new chips on an annual schedule to better compete with Nvidia and take advantage of the boom in AI chips. The new AI chip is the successor to the MI300X, which started shipping late last year. AMD's 2025 chip will be called MI350, and its 2026 chip will be called MI400, the company said.\nThe MI325X's rollout will pit it against Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chips, which Nvidia has said will start shipping in significant quantities early next year.\nA successful launch for AMD's newest data center GPU could draw interest from investors that are looking for additional companies that are in line to benefit from the AI boom. AMD is only up 20% so far in 2024 while Nvidia's stock has risen over 175%. Most industry estimates say Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for data center AI chips.\nAMD's stock fell 4% on Thursday. Nvidia shares were up about 1%.\nAMD's biggest obstacle in taking market share is that its rival's chips use their own programming language, CUDA, which has become standard among AI developers. That essentially locks developers into Nvidia's ecosystem.\nIn response, AMD this week said that it has been improving its competing software, called ROCm, so that AI developers can easily switch more of their AI models over to AMD's chips, which it calls accelerators.\nAMD has framed its AI accelerators as more competitive for use cases where AI models are creating content or making predictions rather than when an AI model is processing terabytes of data to improve. That's partially due to the advanced memory AMD is using on its chip, it said, which allows it to serve Meta's Llama AI model faster than some Nvidia chips.\n\"What you see is that MI325 platform delivers up to 40% more inference performance than the H200 on Llama 3.1,\" said Su, referring to Meta's large language AI model.\nTaking on Intel, too\nWhile AI accelerators and GPUs have become the most intensely watched part of the semiconductor industry, AMD's core business has been central processors, or CPUs, that lay at the heart of nearly every server in the world.\nAMD's data center sales during the June quarter more than doubled in the past year to $2.8 billion, with AI chips accounting for only about $1 billion, the company said in July.\nAMD takes about 34% of total dollars spent on data center CPUs, the company said. That's still less than Intel , which remains the boss of the market with its Xeon line of chips. AMD is aiming to change that with a new line of CPUs, called EPYC 5th Gen, that it also announced Thursday.\nThose chips come in a number of different configurations ranging from a low-cost and low-power 8-core chip that costs $527 to 192-core, 500-watt processors intended for supercomputers that cost $14,813 per chip.\nThe new CPUs are particularly good for feeding data into AI workloads, AMD said. Nearly all GPUs require a CPU on the same system in order to boot up the computer.\n\"Today's AI is really about CPU capability, and you see that in data analytics and a lot of those types of applications,\" Su said.\n\ntitle3:\nKhosla Ventures just backed OpenAI with $405M more, but not necessarily with its own capital\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nKhosla Ventures has raised $405 million for OpenAI, according to a regulatory filing.\nBased on the filing alone, Khosla\u2019s stake in the ChatGPT maker appears to be at least 6% of the $6.6 billion round the company closed last week. But that doesn\u2019t mean Khosla has put substantial or any capital into the round. The majority or possibly all of the $405 million was pooled from other investors through a special purpose vehicle, or an SPV.\nSPVs are used when a firm doesn\u2019t have enough capital to fill a round, or when it has enough exposure to a company and offers its allocation to others clamoring for a stake.\nKhosla Ventures declined to comment, so we don\u2019t know the terms of its participation in OpenAI\u2019s last round, which valued the firm at $157 billion. Either way, OpenAI has been good to Khosla Ventures, which invested $50 million in the company in 2019, for what The Information has since reported was 5% ownership. OpenAI\u2019s valuation at the time isn\u2019t publicly known, but likely it was significantly lower than the $29 billion valuation OpenAI reportedly garnered in 2023, when Microsoft invested $10 billion.\n\ntitle4:\nWhat internet data brokers have on you, and how you can get it back\ndescription4:\nIn this article EFX Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nD3sign | Moment | Getty Images\nData brokers have long operated in the shadows of the internet, quietly amassing unprecedented amounts of personal information on billions of people across the globe, but few realize just how deep this data collection really goes. In an age where every move you make online \u2014 every click, every purchase, every \"like\" \u2014 is meticulously harvested, packaged, and sold for profit, aggregated personal data has become a valuable commodity, and the global data broker industry is proof of that. The rise of artificial intelligence tools poses the risk of even more personal information being scraped from the internet and an already opaque world of data brokering becoming even more aggressive, and that is heightening data privacy concerns. A 2023 study from Pew Research found that the American public increasingly says it does not understand what companies do with their data. According to Pew, 67% of Americans say they \"understand little to nothing about what companies are doing with their personal data, up from 59% in its previous survey on the subject in 2019. A majority of Americans (73%) think they have \"little to no control\" over what companies do with their data. Many people are unaware that something as simple as their phone number can be used by data brokers and bad actors to uncover highly sensitive information, including a Social Security number, address, email, and even family details, said Arjun Bhatnagar, co-founder and CEO of Cloaked, an app that disguises your personal information by generating a unique \"identity\" for each online account you have. According to Roger Grimes, an expert at cybersecurity education firm KnowBe4, while many data brokers \u2014especially the more well-known players \u2014 sell information responsibly, some of the smaller, unknown brokerages skirt regulations, push ethical boundaries, and exploit data in ways that can lead to misuse or harm. This is partly due to the hazy regulation landscape around data brokerage, which makes it easier for these practices to go unchecked. Some of the largest providers of data brokerage services include Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, LexisNexis, Epsilon (formerly Acxiom), and CoreLogic, according to a ranking from OneRep, an online personal data management service. People-search services Spokeo and Intelius are also among the top data brokers, according to OneRep. These companies operate across multiple industries, handling both publicly available information and more sensitive consumer data. They offer various services, ranging from marketing analytics to credit scoring and background checks, and all of them have processes for requesting your data or asking for it to be deleted. However, depending on the state you live in, they may not have to comply. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion are a good place to begin to understand how much the data industry has grown. While many consumers know these companies for their credit services, those are now just one piece of the revenue pie, with broader digital marketing of data increasingly important, according to Jeff Chester, founder and executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington, D.C.,-based consumer privacy advocate. And data collection spans much farther across the economy, with companies from grocery stores offering discount programs to streaming video services amassing data that others will pay for. \"Today, everyone is a data broker. Having the ability to reach someone online and target has become a core part of business,\" Chester said. \"I try to lock down everything as much as I can, but I'm also aware that even though I'm a security expert, I'm probably overexposed,\" said Bruno Kurtic, president and CEO of data security firm Bedrock Security. As a basic step to limit financial risks, he recommends that all individuals freeze their credit reports as a proactive measure against identity theft and to prevent malicious actors from opening new accounts or loans in their name.\nInside data brokers' massive vault\nCybersecurity experts estimate that data brokers collect an average of 1,000 data points on each individual with an online presence. \"It behooves them to collect as much as humanly possible about you, because the larger the information pool about you and the more specific they can get, the higher the cost of that data,\" said Chris Henderson, senior director of threat operations at Huntress, a cybersecurity company founded by former National Security Agency personnel. Here's a breakdown of the types of information data brokers typically collect, according to privacy experts interviewed by CNBC: Basic identifiers. Full name, address, phone number, and email.\nFull name, address, phone number, and email. Financial data. Credit scores and payment history.\nCredit scores and payment history. Purchase history.

Relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. By analyzing your network of friends, followers, and connections on social media and messaging apps, data brokers can map out your relationships and even track how frequently you interact with certain individuals to determine the depth of your bonds.\nLittle oversight around data privacy\nThe lack of comprehensive regulation around data privacy allows data brokers to operate with little oversight, unlike the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. \"There is no comprehensive federal privacy law that specifically regulates the industry, which makes it hard to combat them,\" said Chelsea Magnant, adjunct instructor of cyber leadership at NYU's Center for Global Affairs and a director at corporate consulting firm Brunswick. \"We essentially have a patchwork of state laws with varying privacy protections that these companies know how to navigate.\" California was the first to enact comprehensive legislation in 2018 with the California Consumer Privacy Act, giving residents more control over their personal data. In 2020, California voters approved an expansion of the CCPA, called the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect in 2023. It offers the most extensive protections in the U.S., including data correction, limiting the use of sensitive information, and requiring businesses to honor opt-out preference signals. It also imposes stricter data-protection obligations on companies, such as minimizing data collection. Since then, about 20 other U.S. states have followed suit; however, the specific rights and thresholds for which companies must comply vary widely between states. \"Different states have different business environments, economies, and viewpoints. This lack of a unified approach, something that protects all citizens across the country, leaves us vulnerable to data brokers,\" said Rob Hughes, chief information security officer at RSA. Even in states where the privacy laws are strict, there is skepticism that smaller companies on the margins of the data brokerage industry will follow them. \"They have extremely sensitive data sets under their management, and they have to essentially behave like the most sensitive enterprises. And we know that some of these data brokers just don't operate businesses like that,\" Kurtic said.\nHow to take control of your data\nTo start protecting your privacy, it's important to rethink how much personal information is shared on a daily basis, says Cloaked's Bhatnagar. While we can't fully hide, consumers need to develop new habits and tools to limit what we expose, from turning off permissions that track your location to saying no to cookies and refraining from posting personal details online. Additionally, using tools like secure browsers, VPNs, and tracker blockers can help. Some of the largest technology companies in our daily lives, such as Apple, are continually updating and adding to privacy options, such as on the new iPhone and latest iOS update. An Equifax spokeswoman said U.S. consumers can opt out of their personal information being shared in accordance with U.S. state privacy laws. On average, she said, opt-out requests made through the Equifax Privacy Preference Center are processed in less than one business day and consumers are informed of a successful submission through the company's Preference Center. Consumers can also review the types of third-parties that companies such as Equifax share personal data within its privacy section.\nOpt-out links and instructions are readily available for most of the major data brokers: Experian\nTransUnion\nLexisNexis\nEpsilon But data privacy experts says reclaiming or deleting your data from brokers can be a deliberately complex process that is not only time-consuming but frustrating. Each broker has its own opt-out requirements, and even after you've removed your data, it often reappears, sourced from other places. \"Removing your data from their systems impacts their bottom line, so they are disincentivized to make this easy for you,\" said Henderson. \"Ultimately, if you remove the information, they can't sell that. So the more people who request their information be removed, the less attractive of a broker they are to the advertisers.\" There are data-removal services, such as DeleteMe, Kanary, OneRep, and PrivacyDuck, which charge a fee to manage these ongoing tasks, and are becoming increasingly popular. In October, Consumer Reports launched Permission Slip, a free app that helps you control which companies can collect, store and sell your personal data. It relies on donations to keep it going, either through the app or the Consumer Reports website. For those opting for the DIY approach, here's what the data privacy experts interviewed by CNBC recommend to get started: Identify the brokers collecting your data. As already stated, this can be a daunting task, as many operate behind the scenes. However, there are a few methods you can use to track them down, says Henderson. One is to conduct a Google search using your name, phone number, and email address and see which brokers pop up. You'll most likely find your name on sites like Spokeo, Whitepages, or MyLife. Another strategy is to visit the websites of the largest data brokers and search your information. Submit opt-out requests. If you live in a state with data privacy regulations, you can submit a request to delete your data on the opt-out page of these companies' websites, including at the links listed above, so they cannot share your data with third-party companies. It's important to note that each broker may have different processes for handling these requests and state laws vary when it comes to what types of data are covered. Some data brokers may also require you to provide identification or verify your identity. Check your results. After submitting opt-out requests, revisit the data brokers' sites periodically to ensure your data has been removed. It may take several weeks or months for your request to be processed. Engage in digital hygiene practices. Regularly reviewing and updating your online security practices is essential. Secure passwords, two-factor authentication, and encryption tools can help protect your information. Using virtual identities, such as alternative email addresses and phone numbers, can further safeguard your personal information. Seek legal recourse if necessary. If a data broker refuses to comply with a deletion request, you may be able to file a formal complaint with regulatory authorities such as the Federal Trade Commission, which has brought cases against the industry. However, it's important to understand that not every state provides the same level of protection. Consult a privacy attorney if you believe your rights have been violated.\n'The future is unfortunately dark'\nExperts say deleting the data is an imperfect solution, \"a Band-Aid to address a gaping wound,\" according to Chester. \"Consumers have been placed in a bad position,\" he said. \"Data is now a form of payment,\" he added, referring to cases where the consumer wants a discount in the grocery store or pharmacy. \"This is a comprehensive privacy problem which requires Congress or the FTC. The idea an individual can take care of their privacy ... you can shut down a tiny bit of it, but you would need to spend a great deal of time, and once you opt-in to get a discount at a store, it all starts over again.\" The future of the data broker industry looks both promising and troubling as technological advancements continue. Javad Abed, assistant professor of information systems at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, warns that data brokers will continue to evolve as AI and machine learning advance. \"With AI, data brokers will create even more detailed and predictive profiles, incorporating everything from biometric data to behavioral tracking,\" Abed said. \"The problem will increase, and things are going to become more complicated.\" Abed sees potential in blockchain and privacy-enhancing technologies, which could disrupt the data brokerage model by increasing transparency and giving individuals more control over their digital identities. However, he remains skeptical: \"The future is unfortunately dark. It needs to be collaborative work. I don't see the motivation right now from the main actors for a collaborative change.\" \"Telling our grandmothers or a child to configure settings on their social media and their browsers and search engines is not a winning proposition,\" Kurtic said. \"It's going to take a combination of regulation, technology on the vendor side, and know-how on our own personal side.\"\nUntil regulation steps in, data brokers will continue to collect as much data as possible. \"These are revenue streams for companies that might not have other recurring revenue streams,\" Henderson said. \"And given there's no regulation stopping businesses from selling information about you, I don't see the practice stopping, especially given how lucrative it is.\"\"\n\nResponse:",
