Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\nA number of investors competed to purchase the app, and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, the battle is finally over. As of last week, TikTok officially signed a deal to divest a portion of its U.S. entity to a group of American investors.\nThis comes nearly three months after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that approves the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to an American investor group.\nA week prior, President Trump announced that President Xi Jinping of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.\nWho owns TikTok in the U.S.?\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nAccording to a memo viewed by TechCrunch, the investor group consists of Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and investment firm MGX. Collectively, they will hold 45% of the U.S. operation, with ByteDance keeping nearly a 20% stake. Axios first reported the news, citing sources who estimate TikTok U.S. is valued at approximately $14 billion \u2014 a figure also mentioned by Vice President JD Vance.\nIn September, a report indicated that a \u201cframework\u201d deal was established between the U.S. and China, with a consortium of investors \u2014 including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz \u2014 overseeing TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. These investors were expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares would belong to Chinese stakeholders.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe newly formed \u201cTikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC\u201d will oversee the app\u2019s operations, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance.\nOracle will serve as the trusted security partner, responsible for auditing and ensuring compliance with National Security Terms, according to the memo. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.\nA White House official previously said Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, and the U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.\nByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok\u2019s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.\n\u200bThe deal is scheduled to close on January 22, 2026.\nWhat users in the U.S. should know\nReports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.\nHow did we get here?\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.\nIn response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\nFast-forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nThere have been several contenders, including The People\u2019s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O\u2019Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.\nImage Credits:Justin Sullivan / Getty Images\nAnother group, called the American Investor Consortium, is led by Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley and includes Roblox co-founder David Baszucki, Anchorage Digital co-founder Nathan McCauley, and famous YouTuber MrBeast.\nOthers in the running included Amazon, AppLovin, Microsoft, Perplexity AI, Rumble, Walmart, Zoop, former Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\nThe story has been updated after publication.\n\ntitle2:\n12 investors dish on what 2026 will bring for climate tech\ndescription2:\nThis was supposed to be the year that climate tech died.\nPresident Donald Trump and the Republican Party have done their best to dismantle the Biden administration\u2019s hallmark industrial and climate policies. Even the European Union has begun to ease off its most aggressive goals.\nAnd yet, as the year closes, the receipts provide a different view of climate and clean energy investing in the U.S. and Europe. Instead of tanking, venture bets in the sector remained essentially flat relative to 2024, according to CTVC, far from the slide some had expected.\nThat resiliency is due in part to continued threat of climate change. Perhaps a bigger contributing factor is that many climate technologies have become either cheaper or better than the fossil fuel alternatives \u2014 or are on the cusp of being so.\nThe incredible cost reductions of solar, wind, and batteries continue to fill climate tech\u2019s sails. Not every new technology will follow the same path. But it does provide evidence that fossil fuels aren\u2019t invincible and ample opportunities to fund companies providing cleaner, cheaper replacements do exist.\nData centers continue to dominate\nLast year, I predicted that 2025 would be the year that climate tech learned to love AI and its thirst for electricity, one that has largely borne out. It\u2019s not entirely surprising \u2014 for the climate tech world, cheap, clean energy is its cornerstone.\nInterest in data centers has only increased in the last year. And investors TechCrunch surveyed were nearly unanimous in their agreement that data centers will remain at the center of the conversation in 2026.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cThey are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don\u2019t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026,\u201d Tom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures, told TechCrunch.\n\u201cI\u2019m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates,\u201d Po Bronson, managing director at SOSV\u2019s IndieBio, told TechCrunch.\nIn 2025, data centers were obsessed with securing new sources of power. But Lisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures, thinks they\u2019ll adjust their focus for 2026. \u201cThe 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid,\u201d she said. Decoupling could solve some challenges that data centers face, namely in resistance from grid operators and the public, who are increasingly worried that the new loads are driving up their electricity prices.\nThere will still be the need for more power, though, and investors saw geothermal, nuclear, solar, and batteries as having benefited from the boom. \u201cZero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected,\u201d said Daniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures.\nInvestors also acknowledged the AI bubble might burst; some voiced skepticism about whether it would drag the energy sector down with it.\n\u201cCould a bubble burst in 2026? Sure,\u201d said Kyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health. But it\u2019s not likely to affect infrastructure plans, he added. \u201cThe spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station.\u201d\nAndrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures, thinks the data center bubble might burst in 2026 or early 2027, but that no such bubble exists in electricity generation. \u201cWe still need a LOT more power, and we\u2019ll use that \u2014 no build-out bubble there \u2026 yet.\u201d\nOutside of AI and data centers, Anil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partners, said reindustrialization will take more of the spotlight this year. \u201cWe need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets,\u201d he said, citing robotics, batteries, and power electronics as examples.\nThe continuing quest for power\nThanks to the drumbeat of new data center announcements, energy-related startups have gotten a boost this past year, perhaps none more than those working on nuclear fission. In the last few weeks, nuclear startups have announced rounds totaling over $1 billion, leading to speculation that many will SPAC or go public through a traditional IPO in 2026.\n\u201cNuclear everything is in vogue right now,\u201d Teamey said.\nBut it will take a while for nuclear power to make a dent in electricity demand. In the meantime, tech companies and data center developers have been turning to solar and batteries as inexpensive, rapidly deployable power sources. Grid-scale batteries, in particular, have been a major beneficiary, seeing record-setting deployments in 2025. As alternative battery chemistries like sodium-ion and zinc come to market, they stand to lower costs and drive further adoption.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on [battery] chemistry and business models.\u201d said Leo Banchik, director at Voyager. \u201cOne of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.\u201d\nSeveral investors felt geothermal would step in to help fill the void in the coming years. It helps that investors see enhanced geothermal as a relatively mature technology that\u2019s ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026.\n\u201cGeothermal will be hot on solar\u2019s heals in terms of new generation,\u201d said Joshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures. \u201cNatural gas assets are growing pretty linearly. There\u2019s not much new capacity in turbine manufacturing coming online, and they\u2019re selling everything they can. Geothermal will go geometric.\u201d\nAnd while AI is helping to drive demand, companies and technologies that think beyond the data center will benefit the most, said Laurie Menoud, founding partner at At One Ventures. \u201cData centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.\u201d\nWhich startup is most likely to go public in 2026?\nNot everyone was in agreement or would proffer a guess. But among those who did, several said nuclear or geothermal startups were most likely to go public, either via IPO or SPAC.\nThe name mentioned most was Fervo, the enhanced geothermal startup that recently raised a $462 million round. The company is widely seen as a leader in the sector and is in the midst of building a 500-megawatt development in Utah that should serve as a template for future power plants. Tapping the public markets would give the company more reserves to tackle additional projects.\nTrends to watch\nBeyond data centers, investors are interested in a range of technologies and sectors, including critical minerals, robotics, and software to manage the electrical grid.\n\u201cWe should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category,\u201d said Amy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures. \u201cThe quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.\u201d\nResiliency and adaptation will be big themes in 2026, according to Coca of Toyota Ventures and Posamentier of Congruent Ventures. Achyuta at EIP zeroed in on one potential application: robots that bury electrical transmission lines quicker and more cheaply than humans, mitigating wildfire risks and increasing the grid\u2019s reliability.\nBeebe, at Obvious Ventures, said that EV trucking would also be an area to watch. \u201cOne of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.\u201d\nAI, of course, is likely to play a role in climate tech\u2019s transformation. \u201cWe will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers,\u201d said Matt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill. \u201cCombining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems.\u201d\nBut it might also pay to keep an eye on technologies that have already been written off, said Bronson at SOSV. \u201cWhen investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won\u2019t pan out, that\u2019s when the real breakthroughs finally happen,\u201d he said.\nDive deeper\nBelow are the detailed comments from the investors who replied to TechCrunch\u2019s survey, listed in alphabetical order. Click the link to jump to a specific response.\nAnil Achyuta, partner at Energy Impact Partner\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nReindustrialization beyond data centers will be a major theme. We need to rebuild supply chains for systems that require multiple components and complex flowsheets. For example, supporting next-generation robotics to address labor shortages and national security concerns will require integrated supply chains. Batteries, power electronics, fuel cells, gas turbines, and even home building are examples of end markets/technologies where parts of the value chain will need to be reindustrialized.\nAnother area to watch is AI-driven physical science. While companies like Zanskar (predictive AI for geothermal) and Fabric8Labs (generative cooling for data centers) have shown promise, we haven\u2019t seen many visible breakthroughs yet. That said, the talent pool working on these problems is impressive and could lead to exciting developments.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nGas turbines provide firm capacity and remain the option for many large players deploying data centers. Beyond that, batteries \u2014 particularly sodium-ion \u2014 represent one of the most economical and near-term solutions at the grid-scale. I am bullish about the progress in this technology, and pairing solar with batteries (as companies like Peak Energy are doing) continues to be a highly attractive approach. Next-gen geothermal is also showing a good amount of promise but the timelines are like that of nuclear, potent but will take about a decade to bring full capacity online.\nIn addition, algorithmic solutions to unlock new power using existing infrastructure (e.g., Gridcare, ThinkLabs AI) and optimize workloads (e.g., Emerald AI) can further enhance grid efficiency. There are also other innovations worth noting in bringing more power, such as applying optical coating to transmission lines to reduce losses being advanced by AssetCool (an EIP portfolio company).\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nFervo Energy, Commonwealth Fusion, Redwood Materials would be my personal guesses, but I could be wrong.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nSodium-ion batteries for grid-scale storage are already being deployed and will accelerate significantly in 2026. Another technology to watch is solid-state transformers (note Heron Power is an EIP portfolio company). The industry is advancing faster than expected and scale similarly to semiconductors, though at-scale production might take longer.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nOne emerging trend is the underground build-out of transmission lines. Advances in robotics could enable a rapid, cost-effective approach that significantly reduces wildfire risk and, in turn, mitigates the substantial carbon emissions associated with such events.\nDistributed power, heat, and computation are the last class of trends we are curiously tracking for 2026.\nLeo Banchik, director at Voyager\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nData centers will keep driving record power demand as AI workloads scale. Despite talk of overbuild, we\u2019re unlikely to see much stranded capacity \u2014 as compute gets cheaper and more available, we\u2019ll keep finding new uses for it. The interesting shift is hyperscalers differentiating between clean power sources \u2014 firm vs. intermittent, location, and additionality \u2014 rather than just headline megawatt-hours. This is already playing out in bespoke offtake deals and on-site supply strategies.\nFission and geothermal should see continued momentum from both private capital and federal support. Fusion will likely attract increased federal support as geopolitical competition intensifies, though we\u2019re still many years away from high-capacity-factor grid-scale deployment.\nNatural gas peaker alternatives will gain traction too \u2014 using new turbines and modular designs with integrated carbon capture as grids manage new peak demands from AI.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nSolar and battery build-out will continue given their strong economics. For dispatchable, 24/7 baseload power, we\u2019ll see growth in fission, geothermal, and peaker alternatives like modular gas turbines with integrated carbon capture. There\u2019s also a grid-edge opportunity worth watching: large facilities procuring dedicated baseload on-site rather than adding to grid congestion.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nMost likely fission or geothermal. These companies have raised substantial capital and built strong offtake agreements with hyperscalers and utilities. With multibillion-dollar project pipelines and the need for continued growth financing, several could pursue public markets in 2026.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nEnergy storage deployment is accelerating across residential, commercial, industrial (including data center backup), and grid-scale applications. Domestic supply chains, including second-life battery systems, are gaining traction for stationary storage. We\u2019ll see growth in 2026 with new plays on chemistry and business models. One of the key lessons from earlier failures was scaling gigafactories before proving demand or achieving better unit economics than the status quo. The new wave is more disciplined.\nIndustrial heat pumps and thermal storage systems for steam and process heat are becoming cheaper to operate than gas boilers in many regions and applications, especially where waste heat is available and electricity prices are favorable.\nWe\u2019ll also see more growth in critical minerals and battery materials projects \u2014 lithium, rare earth, magnesium refining; battery component and cell manufacturing; copper recycling \u2014 maturing with federal support as supply chain security becomes a strategic priority.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nSoftware and AI enabling physical infrastructure: real-time factory intelligence that improves energy efficiency and manufacturing yields, AI-based design tools that speed up product development cycles, grid management software that orchestrates intermittent renewables with storage and dispatchable power.\nCompanies taking a clean-sheet approach to reimagining foundational technologies \u2014 a SpaceX-style rethink of components once considered solved problems. Motor designs that eliminate rare earth dependencies, grid infrastructure like transformers with modern manufacturing techniques, advanced materials processing that significantly reduces costs while improving quality. Improvements in robotics help to enable these cost curves, making U.S. manufacturing economically viable where it wasn\u2019t before.\nLastly, dual-use climate technologies with superior unit economics that happen to strengthen domestic supply chains. Defense and industrial policy are backing these not for climate reasons, but because they deliver cost advantages and supply security.\nAndrew Beebe, managing director at Obvious Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nData centers will again dominate. But there will be a lot more talk of a build-out bubble (in data centers, not electricity generation). We will live with the dual reality of too much money/debt spent on data centers, and the speculation bubble will likely burst (maybe early 2027). But at the same time, we\u2019ll still need a LOT more power, and will use that \u2014 no build-out bubble there \u2026 yet.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nFor power generation: geothermal in the near-term. Fission in the mid-term. Fusion in the 10-year-plus long-term. For actual siting: The above technologies can be sited anywhere, but mainly western states for geothermal. For batteries \u2014 PJM [the grid that covers the mid-Atlantic west to parts of Illinois] and Texas.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nVenture-backed: Fervo\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nGeothermal and grid-scale batteries.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nGrid software and EV trucking. One of the biggest pieces of news of 2026 is going to be the release and specs behind the Tesla Semi. The range and pricing of that vehicle will change that industry in ways as powerful as the Model S or 3.\nPo Bronson, managing director at SOSV\u2019s IndieBio\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nI\u2019m still hearing about an ever increasing concentration of effort and focus on data centers virtually every single day in meetings, especially with corporates. To some extent this is from \u201cpicks and shovels\u201d companies who don\u2019t want to get commoditized so they\u2019re strategizing how to be a bigger player/more integrated rather than just a component that\u2019s purchased.\nA related phrase I hear more frequently is power density and/or specific power (power to weight), as a load of corporates are anticipating or planning how their energy divisions branch into robotics. Duncan Turner here is our expert.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nI don\u2019t have a climate tech company in my portfolio going public in 2026. Tidal Vision is targeting 2027. That\u2019s my closest. I don\u2019t want to opine on other VC\u2019s portfolio companies, even though I have my feelings, because I shouldn\u2019t open my mouth where I\u2019m only partially informed.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nFor larger scales in 2026, my fastest scaling companies are Tidal Vision and Voyage Foods, which has taken over a General Motors plant in Ohio.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nOn what to pay more attention to, I\u2019ll toot Duncan\u2019s horn here again \u2014 what he\u2019s doing with the Plasma Forge is IMHO going to be super compelling and make everyone study at night.\nOne last note is my consistent feeling that it\u2019s when investors finally get tired of a sector and come to the conclusion it won\u2019t pan out that the real breakthroughs finally happen. I learned this lesson back in 1999 when we were all wondering if the search space was going to be won by Yahoo, AltaVista, Excite, Lycos, or Infoseek.\nI do feel like that\u2019s happening in my personal portfolio. I said this to AgFunder recently, but when the VC world asks about winning sectors, there\u2019s a presumption that the sector will be so hot that there will be multiple winners. Most markets don\u2019t have multiple winners, and the sector doesn\u2019t win; just one company wins.\nTom Chi, founding partner at At One Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nThere will be a lot more around data centers in 2026. They are creating their own financial ecosystem, and there is enough actual momentum in current AI efforts that I don\u2019t see the hyperscalers pulling back in 2026.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nBudgets for hyperscalers are in the $50 billion to $100 billion range, which encompasses power, chips, and much more. The chips are expensive enough that folks are willing to pay a bit more to get power on the grid sooner as the losses from chip depreciation are greater than most things you could incrementally add to your power scale-up budget.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nIPO market still a bit murky, and most folks don\u2019t telegraph exactly when they will go public.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nFolks like Fervo are at an interesting inflection point. One of our portcos Provectus Algae is also at an interesting point.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nWe\u2019ve had a pretty big pendulum swing away from the more capital-intensive work in industrial decarbonization that aren\u2019t in AI. They are still critical for our collective future, even if out of fashion for a few years.\nLisa Coca, partner at Toyota Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nIn our view at Toyota Ventures, the 2026 data center energy conversation is likely to shift from demand to resilience and the need to accelerate plans to decouple from the grid.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nWe believe that the biggest investment opportunities are in firm, dispatchable, and scalable carbon-free energy. We have actively invested in technologies that support increasing baseload power, both geothermal and nuclear, through portfolio companies such as Rodatherm and Natura Resources. For critical grid flexibility, we are backing advanced, long-duration energy storage battery technologies with an investment in e-Zinc.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nWe anticipate that nuclear power will continue to lead the way in terms of IPOs and SPACs in 2026.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nChallenging question since we believe it is more a function of how, and if, the capital stack continues to evolve. There is a healthy number of climate tech companies across multiple sectors that are on the cusp of deploying at a larger scale. The biggest hurdle is securing FOAK financing to de-risk the all-important step of advancing from first of a kind to nth of a kind.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nOur team expects resiliency and adaptation will continue to reign strong in 2026. The Toyota Ventures portfolio illustrates this: BurnBot addresses wildfire mitigation, ZymoChem bolsters supply chain resilience with sustainable materials, and Alora creates adaptable resource solutions.\nAmy Duffuor, general partner at Azolla Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nMy prediction is that the energy conversation shifts from generation of power to how fast power can actually be delivered. Interconnection timelines, permitting, and physical grid constraints continue to be a bottleneck and data centers will increasingly rely on hybrid strategies that blend grid power, storage, and demand flexibility to hit timelines.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nOne opportunity is at grid-ready sites, like places with existing transmission and substation. Anything that shortens interconnection timelines creates outsized value right now because access to the grid is scarce. Also interested in wireless transmission of power even though it\u2019s in the early stages.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nThere has been a lot of talk about Fervo Energy\u2026!\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nLong-duration energy storage technology companies, which will move from initial pilots to demos to repeatable deployments. We\u2019re particularly excited about our portfolio company Noon Energy.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nWe should be paying more attention to grid execution as a category. The quiet winners are companies that make interconnection, planning, and deployment faster software, hardware, and supply-chain solutions that help utilities actually move projects forward.\nDaniel Goldman, managing partner at Clean Energy Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nWe expect to see an acceleration of deal making in the data center/hyperscaler space consisting of the following:\nStructured power off take agreements with a mix of behind-the-meter and utility-related infrastructure to bring optimization around pricing and reliability; More action at the federal, ISO/RTO, and state level to accelerate deployment of energy assets while balancing tariff structures that avoid burdening voting consumers with increased costs; M&A in the technology optimization area, including resources such as geothermal, nuclear, critical minerals and downstream hardware and software products enabling the digitalization, decarbonization and distribution of energy supplies and load management, a key area of our focus and that which venture capital in general is quite focused on.\nWhile we don\u2019t expect an overall \u201cbust cycle\u201d for data center and hyperscaler development activities, we do expect some rationalization of development and implementation of efficiency options to reduce capacity needs.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nThe greatest near-term opportunity \u2014 and challenge \u2014 lies in improving the grid itself. Grid modernization through digitalization, decarbonization, and decentralization will unlock cost savings, optimize existing infrastructure, and better integrate significant distributed energy resources \u2014 probably not saying anything new here. Zero-carbon generation is already among the cheapest sources of power, and growing demand for both grid-scale and distributed batteries is accelerating cost reductions faster than expected.\nWe expect this trend to continue despite recent policy shifts in the IRA and there are hundreds of venture capital-backed companies that can have a material impact on the grid as they scale-up and see more adoption rates in the market. Disruption is here!\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nFactorial appears to be a leading candidate following its plans to de-SPAC in 2026. Its trajectory illustrates that companies with strong customer traction in large markets, clear cost and performance advantages, and rapidly scaling revenues are well-positioned for the public markets. (This SPAC market contrasts with the 2020 one where entrants such as QuantumScape did not have meaningful revenues and perhaps were ill-prepared for public markets.)\nWatch out for more companies hitting public markets on hype, instead of good fundamentals.\nBeyond Factorial, several companies in energy storage, generation, and critical minerals are approaching scalable revenue levels to access low-cost of capital public markets (a real benefit), though in the minerals sector we may see growth in mergers and acquisitions precede any public offerings in 2026.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nProjects in energy storage, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), critical minerals, and material manufacturing facilities across the energy supply chain will see significant investment in the U.S., with manufacturing tax credits and attractive market opportunities still available notwithstanding federal policy headwinds.\nIn 2025, we extensively evaluated and developed new risk transfer solutions for FOAK project developers. We see commercial lenders and private credit starting to lean more heavily into this space with the support of insurance underwriting and catalytic capital. We expect to see more projects and more debt financing for early commercialization, which up until this point has only trickled in. This is the key enabler of the greater scale we need across the industry.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nFor western markets to compete with China\u2019s manufacturing and increasingly innovation prowess, financial innovation is CRITICAL. Global markets need to deploy $3 trillion to $9 trillion per year through 2050 on climate related technologies and implementation of projects if we hope to reduce global temperatures and compete in these markets internationally. Global spending on climate related investment was only $2 trillion in 2024 and is on a path for a similar amount in 2025.\nTo increase the rate of deployment, we must convince public and private investors that the risk-return balance is favorable to deploy capital across the climate capital stack \u2014 early-stage venture, growth-stage venture, private equity, commercial lending and private credit, and infrastructure. Our sector is not attracting enough capital; in simple terms, risks need to decline or returns need to increase.\nWe see opportunities to use risk-sharing mechanisms to optimize capital stacks and lower the cost of capital for new technology projects, which also brings them down the cost curve faster. Promising solutions include technology and performance risk insurance, surety bonds for managing construction risks, pooling off-take agreements among buyer groups (e.g., hyperscalers for clean power or airlines for SAF), filling gaps in construction financing, and more. Clean Energy Ventures\u2019 spent time during 2025 identifying new risk transfer solutions working closely with our counterparts in the finance and insurance sectors. We believe 2026 will see more innovative financing solutions enabling faster scaling of climate technologies.\nWe should also be paying very close attention to cost curves. The impact of AI is showing up but not being widely reported in climate tech. Inside large companies and small startups the benefits of AI are driving costs down, allowing faster innovation at complex facilities and in supply chains. This is apparent in chemicals, mining and refining, power generation and grid optimization, manufacturing (steel, cement), recycling and waste management, and more.\nWe are only at the embryonic stage of seeing the impact of AI on the cost curves in a wide range of commodities and industries. As we talk about the upward impact on power prices driven by AI infrastructure requirements, we need to keep in mind that AI will also radically transform industries globally and reduce cost of production.\nLaurie Menoud, At One Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nYes, there\u2019s been massive excitement around everything connected to data centers, energy generation, storage, transmission, cooling. But from a VC perspective, building and scaling data centers isn\u2019t a startup timeline. It\u2019s a decade-long struggle of permits, substations, and grid upgrades. To put numbers on it, hyperscale data centers take 3 to 6 years to permit and connect in the US today. In some markets, interconnection alone can exceed 5 to 7 years. So in 2026, I expect to see continued traction for energy companies that are not only tied to data centers but can expand into commercial and industrial use cases and front-of-the-meter applications. Data centers are one demand driver, not the whole market.\nRelated to this is the supply of critical metals, which I continue to be very focused on: mining, extraction, refining, and recycling. This is critical not only for data centers (especially copper), but also for EV batteries with lithium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nIn places where thermal (coal and gas) and nuclear plants are being retired, because those sites already have high-capacity grid connections. That makes deploying new clean generation dramatically faster. In the U.S. alone, more than 60 GW of coal capacity has retired since 2015, and another 40+ GW is scheduled to retire by 2030. Each retirement frees up a transmission node that took decades to build. Reusing that interconnection is often the difference between a 2-year vs. an 8-year project timeline. And that\u2019s where you could install next-gen nuclear reactors, like Stellaria, that cut long-lived waste, capex, opex, deployment time, and extends fuel use, or geothermal energy like Factor2 Energy, utilizing underground CO2 reservoirs for lower constraints on deployment location.\nThe same is true of industrial sites (chemicals, steel, refineries) that already have oversized grid connections. These sites are trying to expand production, and add storage, and they already have one of the hardest problems solved: interconnection. If you want to electrify heavy industry quickly, you go where the grid already exists.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nNo one can really know, but the battery recycling and circular critical materials subsector is one I\u2019d watch closely. Lithium, nickel, and cobalt prices are extremely sensitive to geopolitics, and recycling provides a lower-risk, domestic supply for the U.S.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nRelectrify is deploying their battery systems at commercial production scale in 2026 with a cumulative capacity of 100 MWh. They use cell-level semiconductor circuitry to individually control battery cells at high frequency, directly producing an alternating current waveform. No need for an inverter anymore, which is a direct win on CAPEX, improved usable lifetime battery capacity, and lower OPEX by identifying and replacing malfunctioning cells with precision. It\u2019s happening now.\nAnd overall, grid-scale energy storage beyond lithium, driven by both AI data centers and renewable growth. Without it, you simply can\u2019t run 24/7 clean power outside of nuclear and hydro. Globally, stationary storage is projected to grow from ~45 GWh in 2023 to hundreds of GWs by 2030. Some of the new technologies are already ready today.\nBattery recycling and closed-loop supply chains with automakers (recycled lithium, nickel, cobalt, and copper going back into new batteries) are also already scaling. 2026 is about acceleration. Ascend Elements has already built the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facility in North America, and has now achieved the first production of recycled lithium carbonate. Imports make up the majority of the US supply of lithium carbonate today, mostly from Argentina and Chile. If you can secure your metal supply with lower-cost recycled content, isn\u2019t that a big win?\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nCompanies like Chemfinity, that could make domestic metal refining at cost parity with China, and anything tied to mining, extraction, refining, and recycling of critical metals for data centers and EVs. Copper is THE metal for data centers. It\u2019s used in power cables, busbars, transformers, cooling loops. A single gigawatt of data-center capacity requires on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. And about 40% \u2013 45% of the world\u2019s copper refining is in China, followed by Chile. It\u2019s the same geographical structure as lithium refining and battery precursor chemistry. People talk about energy security. This is what it actually looks like.\nJoshua Posamentier, managing partner at Congruent Ventures\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nPush for growth will continue but attention will shift from flashy gigawatt announcements to construction, commissioning, and dealing with the brutal realities of interconnect and permitting delays. The result will be a huge upwelling of \u201cbring your own generation\u201d and \u201cdemand flexibility.\u201d\nThe age of ASSPs/ASICs will begin in earnest for AI data centers. GPUs will continue to grow, but the rate will taper in favor of more specialist chips that are far more efficient, especially for inference loads. This will start decoupling data center power consumption from token generation.\nThe unit economics of the marquee foundational AI shops will leak. They will not look good. But they will convince investors to support them through their trough of upside down unit economics until they achieve positive unit economics, which will come sooner than expected. But the shine will be off: These will fall into a different bucket than high margin SaaS companies from prior bubbles.\nData centers will become far better grid participants through flexibility, load shaping, and power quality, and they will be rewarded with far faster interconnect times than other big loads \u2014 the more tech they adopt, the faster they\u2019ll get connected.\nWe\u2019ll see the first off-grid world-scale data center NTP [notice to proceed, or a letter telling a contractor to begin work]. We\u2019ll also see more NIMBY pushback on proximate data centers because of everything from power costs to size to water use.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nNuclear fusion! I think we\u2019ll see the first net gain by analysis (i.e., deuterium fusion where it would be Q>1 if it were tritium) in a startup reactor.\nGeothermal will be hot on solar\u2019s heels in terms of new generation with linearly deploying gas assets.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nSPAC or IPO? Lots in the pipe, pun intended.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nGeothermal for electricity and district heating. Friction is still way too high for single site geothermal heat loops to scale much faster than today. Thermal energy storage (load shifting) for industrial applications.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nRobotics (not the humanoid kind) are taking over a huge number of labor-intensive industries; they will impact many industrial, agriculture, waste, and manufacturing operations in 2026.\nLogistics and manufacturing efficiency: electrification, efficiency, onshoring, and AI are pushing on emissions from half of the economy and these sectors are economic, not impact buyers. Give them long-term certainty on lower costs vs. conventional fuels, for example, and you\u2019ll have buyers. This is everything from electrified autonomous trucking to electric autonomous rail and dark terminals.\nResilience technology is going to really get going. Insurance costs (due to climate risk) are outpacing every other cost for homeowners and impacting commercial operations. Businesses and individuals are going to aggressively begin to invest in resilience in the face of accelerating climate change and extreme weather but also aging infrastructure and a shift from centralized to distributed resource paradigms.\nMatt Rogers, founder at Incite and Mill\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nData centers will serve as factories for the next phase of AI innovation powering America\u2019s society and economy. I think local governments will step up more in 2026 and challenge hyperscalers to deliver solutions that are more in line with community needs and municipal partnership that allows for swifter construction. Energy affordability is top of mind, and we really need to reverse the trend of 2025 of rising costs.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nThe call is coming from inside the house in 2026. In other words, consumers have more impact than anyone thinks. Decentralized infrastructure solutions, including rooftop solar, energy storage, and distributed energy resources, like heat pumps and smart thermostats, are available today. Households can turn them on swiftly, cost-effectively, and without the major disruptions to grids across the nation we are seeing today. It\u2019s faster to permit than building new centralized power plants.\nIf enough people adopt these approachable solutions, America\u2019s grid has a better shot at handling the increased capacity from the data center AI boom.\nThere\u2019s also an alignment opportunity hiding in plain sight: AI pioneers and Big Tech companies want a faster, more predictable path to build. Local and state governments want affordability, economic investment, and resilience. Communities are actually in a unique position to trade swift permitting and flexible construction timelines for economic rejuvenation, tax revenue, and job creation from the private sector.\nBy enabling more efficient households with lower utility bills, hyperscalers can access the energy they need to operate AI data centers. Much faster. That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t a moonshot. The opposite, in fact.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nMill. We\u2019ll deploy more Food Recyclers, and on a different scale, than ever before. We\u2019re planning more partnerships to encourage more households, businesses, and communities to view food as something to return back to the food system rather than leave for weeks in dumpsters and then years in landfills.\nRobotics is going to attract massive funding and private sector attention in 2026. Simultaneously, builders will move away from the hype around humanoid models towards functional robots designed to handle specific tasks and make life easier. The future of robotics will look more like Roomba than your neighbor Rhonda, which actually bodes well from both an affordability and technology risk perspective.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nWe will see massive innovation where AI meets the physical world in 2026 on both the infrastructure and consumer app layers. Combining AI with smart hardware and physical infrastructure will ensure the transformation of trillion-dollar industries from manufacturing to life sciences to food systems. In order for AI to power the future without tanking grids or negatively impacting communities, it must be paired with physical hardware that solves problems and makes everyday life better for people. We\u2019ll benefit as much from an AI smartphone as we will with an AI-powered waste facility.\nKyle Teamey, managing partner at RA Capital Planetary Health\nData centers have dominated conversations about energy in 2025. What should we expect in 2026?\nI think data centers will still dominate in 2026. But I guess I\u2019m a little jaded on this stuff because I was in the last AI cycle \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of the same conversation. But the level of investment is orders of magnitude greater. The level of attention is orders of magnitude greater. And so it\u2019s going to take a long while for this to shake out one way or another.\nThe spending for 2026 is already budgeted. The train has left the station. Could a bubble burst in 2026? Sure. But that would take a while to be manifested. It\u2019s going to take months to a year perhaps to to really be manifested. You\u2019d have to shut it off midstream and try to claw your money back. That\u2019s pretty hard to do.\nWhere is the biggest opportunity to find or place power on the grid?\nThis has been talked about a lot, but the data use, the requirements for data, it scales fairly exponentially. Power it scales quite linearly. As a consequence, it\u2019s going to take a long while, I think, for the physical world to catch up to the data demand side. It\u2019s really all of the above. If you can if you can do anything in power generation, power storage, transmission, distribution, if you can improve grid operations \u2014 the list goes on and on and on.\nA bull market in electricity like this, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been, maybe like a century? And so it really, at least to us, it looks like it\u2019s all of the above. Lots and lots of interesting opportunities within that. We\u2019ve seen some companies go public in the like the last 12, 18 months. We probably will see more. I think it\u2019s fair to to think that there will be.\nWhich climate tech or clean energy startup is most likely to IPO in 2026?\nI think power generation is gonna see more public companies in 2026, for sure. There could be a wide, wide variety there. Nuclear everything is in vogue right now. We\u2019ll likely see more of those. Geothermal, we\u2019ll definitely see some of those. And you\u2019ve already got a bunch of interesting players who are in project development and implementation, some of those could go public as well. It\u2019s not just the tech companies, but the folks up and down the value chain.\nWhich technologies do you think will be ready to deploy at larger scales in 2026?\nNuclear fission companies in particular. That could be a bubble for sure, but if some of these companies start succeeding and start getting uh projects built. Every few years these opportunities pop up, and it makes sense that people take advantage of those opportunities to raise some additional cash and grow more rapidly.\nWhat trend or technology should we be paying more attention to?\nThere haven\u2019t been any technologies I\u2019ve seen recently where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh wow that\u2019s going to change the world, everyone should be looking at that.\u2019 I do think it is more about scaling for a lot of these right now. If you can hit scale quickly, it\u2019s an amazing opportunity.\nIf you look at the the various trends, it\u2019s not just the manufacturing demand. The other driver is the regionalization of everything, which is driving demand for labor, for resources. Fill in the blank, there\u2019s demand for it.\n\ntitle3:\nThe best AI-powered dictation apps of 2025\ndescription3:\nIn some ways, 2025 was when AI dictation apps really took off. Dictation apps have been around for years, but in the past they\u2019ve proved slow and inaccurate \u2014 unless you speak with particular accents and enunciate clearly.\nBut advances in large language models (LLMs) and speech-to-text models have helped improve the systems that can decipher speech better while retaining the context to format the text. And developers have built in features to automatically format text, remove filler words, and ignore fumbles to output text that would need fewer edits.\nBut with the soaring popularity of everything AI, there\u2019s dozens of such apps on the market. So we\u2019ve collated our pick of the best and most useful dictation apps his year.\nWispr Flow\nWispr Flow is a well-funded AI dictation app that lets you add custom words and instructions for dictation. It has native apps for macOS, Windows, and iOS, and an Android version is in the works.\nThe app lets you customize how its system transcribes your notes by letting you choose from \u201cformal,\u201d \u201ccasual,\u201d and \u201cvery casual\u201d styles for different kinds of writing, such as personal messaging, work, and email.

Its subscription plans offer unlimited transcription and start at $15 per month.\nImage Credits:Wispr Flow\nWillow\nWillow advertises itself as a big time-saver for those who don\u2019t like to type. Alongside common features like automatic editing and formatting, the app has a feature that taps large language models to generate a full chunk of text from just a few dictated words.\nWillow also takes a more privacy-focused stab at AI-assisted note-taking by storing all transcripts locally on your device, and lets you opt out of model training as well. It also lets you add custom vocabulary to the app to help it adapt to your industry\u2019s parlance, or your local dialect.\nImage Credits:Willow\nWillow lets you dictate 2,000 words per month on its desktop app for free. Individual subscription plans start at $15 per month, giving you unlimited dictation and enabling the app to remember your writing style.\nMonologue\nIf you are focused on privacy, Monologue lets you download its model so you can run it on your device for transcriptions and avoid sending data to the cloud. What\u2019s more, the app lets you customize its tone of voice according to the apps you use it with.\nMonologue lets you jot down 1,000 words per month for free, and its subscription costs $10 per month, or $100 per year. And if you end up becoming one of the app\u2019s top users, the company will also send you this funky Monokey to use with the app.\nKeyboards are so 1983.\nYou only need one key\u2014Monokey, the limited edition device that turns your voice into text in Monologue.\nWe're giving away 10, along with a free annual subscription to Monologue. pic.twitter.com/nXuz1ll2LU \u2014 Monologue (@usemonologue) November 18, 2025\nSuperwhisper\nSuperwhisper is primarily a dictation app, but it can also transcribe from audio or video files. The app gives you the freedom to choose and download AI models, including its own models that have different speeds and accuracy, along with Nvidia\u2019s Parakeet speech-recognition models.\nThe app also lets you write custom prompts to steer the output.

Now, academic spinouts have consolidated into a solid startup funnel worth $398 billion \u2014 and VC money is following.\nAccording to Dealroom\u2019s European Spinout Report 2025, 76 of these deep tech and life sciences companies have either reached $1 billion valuations, $100 million in revenue, or both. These include unicorns like Iceye, IQM, Isar Aerospace, Synthesia, and Tekever, which are now inspiring more funds to back university spinouts.\nJust this month, two new funds emerged that will bring more funding to talent emerging out of European tech universities, while adding breadth to a pipeline currently topped by Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH Zurich.\nPSV Hafnium, out of Denmark, recently closed its inaugural fund at an oversubscribed \u20ac60 million (approximately $71 million), with a focus on Nordic deep tech. With offices in Berlin and London, but also in Aachen, U2V (University2Ventures) is targeting the same amount for its first fund, of which it recently completed the first closing.\nThese two newcomers join the growing ranks of European venture firms that have university spinouts as a core part of their investment thesis. Pioneered by the likes of Cambridge Innovation Capital and Oxford Science Enterprises, which have now fully matured, this category has also diversified.\nWhile it still mostly consists of funds backed by one or several universities and institutes, it now includes independent firms that simply see spinouts as potential fund returners \u2014 and rightly so. Oxford Ionics, acquired by U.S.-based IonQ, was one of the six spinouts out of Switzerland, the U.K., and Germany that delivered exits of more than $1 billion to their investors in 2025.\nThese exits come alongside increased amounts of funding. According to Dealroom, European university spinouts in deep tech and life sciences are on track to raise a near all-time-high $9.1 billion in 2025. This contrasts with overall VC funding in Europe, which is down nearly 50% from its 2021 peak.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

In many cases, these startups leverage research from specialized labs, which also explains why there is a long tail of European locations capable of producing spinouts.\nBuilding relationships with hubs outside of Oxbridge and leading countries can also be a way for newcomers to differentiate themselves and find deals. \u201cThe Nordic\u2019s research institutions hold extraordinary, untapped potential,\u201d PSV Hafnium\u2019s partners stated in a press release.\nPSV Hafnium itself is a spinout from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU), but is also making early-stage investments in other Nordic countries. One of its nine checks to date went to SisuSemi, a Finnish startup leveraging a decade of research at the University of Turku to bring new surface cleaning tech to the semiconductor industry.\nIt is good news for teams like SisuSemi that there is more funding available to them. It also comes in addition to grants, commercialization support, and improved deal terms that contribute to an encouraging environment for Europe\u2019s spinouts. However, one pain point remains: growth capital.\nAs the report\u2019s authors note, this gap \u201cis not a unique trend to spinouts, but something impacting the entire startup ecosystem in Europe.\u201d Still, it is quite striking that nearly 50% of late-stage funding for European deep tech and life sciences spinouts comes from outside Europe, mainly from the U.S.\nWhile this share has decreased over the years, Europe won\u2019t be fully reaping the benefits of its investments in talent and research unless this changes more substantially \u2014 but that\u2019s a broader issue to be solved.\"\n\nResponse:",
