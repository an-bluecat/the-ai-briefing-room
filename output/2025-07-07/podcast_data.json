Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

This marks the latest high-ranking AI executive Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has scooped up to lead his new AI superintelligence unit.\nPang previously ran Apple\u2019s in-house team that trained the AI foundation models that underpin Apple Intelligence and other on-device AI features, according to the report. Apple\u2019s AI models haven\u2019t exactly been a huge success \u2014 they\u2019re far less capable than what OpenAI, Anthropic, and even Meta offer. Apple has reportedly even considered tapping third-party AI models to power its forthcoming AI-enabled Siri upgrade.\nSources told Bloomberg that Pang\u2019s departure might be the first of many in Apple\u2019s troubled AI unit.\nNevertheless, Pang could bring expertise in designing small, on-device AI models to Meta, joining an array of talent Zuckerberg has poached in recent months, including leaders from Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Safe Superintelligence.\n\ntitle1:\nCoreWeave acquires data center provider Core Scientific in $9B stock deal\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nCoreWeave announced Monday that it signed a $9 billion all-stock deal to acquire Core Scientific, a data center infrastructure provider.\nAs a result of the deal, CoreWeave says it will gain access to more than a gigawatt of data center capacity \u2014 enough energy to power more than 850,000 homes \u2014 that it can rent out for AI training and inference workloads. Much like CoreWeave, Core Scientific previously offered Bitcoin mining services, but now its GPUs will run and train generative AI models.\nCloud infrastructure providers are racing to grow their data center footprint to keep up with the seemingly never-ending computational demands of AI companies. Bloomberg reported last week that OpenAI struck a deal to rent an additional 4.5 gigawatts\u2019 worth of data center capacity from Oracle, expanding on the two companies\u2019 already massive Stargate infrastructure deal.\n\ntitle2:\nFortnite maker Epic Games settles antitrust case against Samsung\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nFortnite maker Epic Games has settled its antitrust case against Samsung, according to a court filing. The case, filed last September, accused Samsung of working with Google to block rival app stores by default on Samsung phones.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dismissing our court case against Samsung following the parties\u2019 discussions,\u201d Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said in a post on X. He added, \u201cWe are grateful that Samsung will address Epic\u2019s concerns.\u201d\nAn Epic spokesperson declined further comment, pointing to Sweeney\u2019s post. Samsung and Google did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nEpic had alleged in the lawsuit that Samsung\u2019s \u201cAuto Blocker\u201d feature, which blocked downloads outside of the Google Play Store and Samsung Galaxy Store, was a coordinated effort to block competition in app distribution.\nAt the time, Google called Epic\u2019s legal action \u201cmeritless,\u201d saying, \u201cAndroid device makers are free to take their own steps to keep their users safe and secure.\u201d Samsung said it planned to \u201cvigorously contest Epic Game\u2019s baseless claims.\u201d\nThe settlement comes almost a year after Epic launched its own mobile app store to distribute both its own games and third-party titles.\nBefore suing Samsung, Epic won a separate antitrust case against Google in 2023 over claims that Google\u2019s app store practices constituted an illegal monopoly. A judge ordered Google to open its app store to rivals, though a decision on Google\u2019s appeal is still pending.\n\ntitle3:\nChatGPT is testing a mysterious new feature called 'study together'\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nSome ChatGPT subscribers are reporting a new feature appearing in their drop-down list of available tools called \u201cStudy Together.\u201d\nThe mode is apparently the chatbot\u2019s way of becoming a better educational tool. Rather than providing answers to prompts, some say it asks more questions and requires the human to answer, like OpenAI\u2019s answer to Google\u2019s LearnLM. Some also wonder whether it will have a mode where more than one human can join the chat in a study group mode. OpenAI did not respond to our request for comment but, for what it\u2019s worth, ChatGPT told us, \u201cOpenAI hasn\u2019t officially announced when or if Study Together will be available to all users \u2014 or if it will require ChatGPT Plus.\u201d\nThe feature is interesting because ChatGPT has quickly become a mainstay in education in both helpful and not-so-helpful ways. Teachers are using it for things like lesson plans; students can use it like a tutor \u2014 or they can use it to write their papers for them. Some have even suggested that ChatGPT could be \u201ckilling\u201d higher education. This could be a way for ChatGPT to encourage the good uses while discouraging \u201ccheating.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nApple appeals EU's \u20ac500M fine over App Store payment restraints\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nApple on Monday filed an appeal against the EU\u2019s decision to fine the company \u20ac500 million (about $580 million) for not complying with rules that mandate the company to let developers steer users outside the App Store to make purchases, according to multiple reports.\nThe European Commission issued the fine in April, saying that Apple failed to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) rules to allow developers to accept payments for their apps outside Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\nApple revised its fee structure for app distribution in the EU in late June with a more complicated framework that includes an initial acquisition fee, a store services fee, and a core technology commission to accommodate alternative payment methods. This move was likely to avoid further fines from the European Commission.\n\u201cWe believe the European Commission\u2019s decision \u2014 and their unprecedented fine \u2014 go far beyond what the law requires. As our appeal will show, the EC is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users,\u201d Apple told TechCrunch in a comment.\nThe story has been updated with Apple\u2019s comments\"\n\nResponse:",
