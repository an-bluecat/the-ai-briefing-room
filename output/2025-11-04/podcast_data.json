The media giant (formerly known as Dotdash Meredith) made the announcement Tuesday as a part of parent company IAC\u2019s third-quarter earnings.\nUnder the deal, People Inc. will become a launch partner in Microsoft\u2019s publisher content marketplace. This is the company\u2019s second AI deal following its earlier agreement with OpenAI last year.\nPeople Inc. CEO Neil Vogel described the new marketplace as \u201cessentially a pay-per-use market where AI players directly can compensate publishers for use of their content on, sort of like an \u2018a la carte\u2019 basis.\u201d\nHe also praised Microsoft for being committed to paying for content to support its AI efforts, adding that Microsoft\u2019s Copilot would be the first buyer for the marketplace.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very strong endorsement of us to be in the room with them and a very strong endorsement of the publishing marketplace and the value of content to make AI that is of high value,\u201d Vogel said.\nThe announcement of the Microsoft deal was shared during IAC\u2019s earnings, alongside the news that Google Search\u2019s AI Overviews has been hurting the publisher\u2019s traffic. For the first time, People Inc. shared data with investors that showed how Google Search, which accounted for 54% of its traffic two years ago, had dropped to 24% of its traffic during the past quarter.\nThe agreement differs from the OpenAI deal, which Vogel characterized as more of an \u201call-you-can-eat\u201d model, but said People Inc. was happy with either model. What matters to the company is that its work is \u201crespected and paid for,\u201d he said. The company didn\u2019t share the specific deal terms, though.\nPeople Inc. has taken issue with the way AI companies have ingested media without paying to fuel their AI products and train their models. Recently, Vogel criticized Google, calling the tech giant a \u201cbad actor\u201d because it uses the same bot to crawl websites for its Google search engine and its AI features. Publishers can\u2019t block the bot, as Google search still accounts for a large percentage of their traffic.\nHowever, People Inc. uses the technology from web infrastructure provider Cloudflare to block other AI crawlers, prompting AI players to approach it with content deals. In September, Vogel attributed its decision to leverage Cloudflare\u2019s tech as a way to push AI companies to the negotiating table, noting that its progress on deals was \u201cmuch further along\u201d after adopting the solution.\nHe reiterated those comments on today\u2019s earnings call with investors, saying that blocking AI crawlers has been \u201cvery effective\u201d and \u201cbrought almost everyone to the table.\u201d Vogel suggested that more deals would be announced in time, as well.\nIAC reported that People Inc. grew its digital revenue 9% to $269 million in the quarter, driven by performance marketing and licensing, which saw 38% and 24% growth, respectively. It also noted its acquisition of a food-focused media publisher and influencer network Feedfeed.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle's AI Mode gets new agentic capabilities to help book event tickets and beauty appointments\ndescription1:\nGoogle announced on Tuesday that it\u2019s launching new agentic capabilities in AI Mode, its feature that allows users to ask complex questions and follow-ups to dig deeper on a topic directly within Search.\nUsers can now get help with booking event tickets and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode.\nFor example, you can say, \u201cFind me two cheap tickets for the Shaboozey concert coming up. Prefer standing floor tickets.\u201d AI Mode will then search across multiple websites to find real-time ticket options that meet your specific requests. It will then present you with a curated list of ticket prices to choose from. AI Mode links you directly to the booking page so you can finalize your purchase.\nThe new agentic capabilities are available to all users opted into Google\u2019s experimental arm, Search Labs, in the U.S. The company notes that Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers have access to high limits.\nGoogle first brought agentic capabilities to AI Mode back in August, when it started letting people use the feature to find restaurant reservations.\nImage Credits:Google\nWith this capability, you can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. For example, you could ask, \u201cFind me a dinner reservation for three people this Friday after 6 p.m. around Logan Square. Craving ramen or bibimbap.\u201d\nAI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from.\n\u201cOur priority in Google Search is connecting you with high-quality information you can rely on,\u201d Google explained on its Search Labs page. \u201cThis new mode is rooted in our core quality and safety systems, but it\u2019s still an early experiment and may make mistakes.\u201d\nGoogle first launched AI Mode in March to take on popular services like Perplexity AI and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search. Since then, the tech giant has brought AI Mode to more than 180 countries and has been building it out with new functionalities. For instance, AI Mode recently got access to a Canvas feature that helps you build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel. It also now lets you use Google Lens to ask about what\u2019s on your desktop screen.\n\ntitle2:\nNVIDIA, Qualcomm join U.S., Indian VCs to help build India's next deep tech startups\ndescription2:\nNVIDIA and Qualcomm Ventures have joined a growing coalition of U.S. and Indian investors backing India\u2019s deep tech startups. The group launched in September with more than $1 billion in commitments, timing that aligns with India\u2019s new \u20b91 trillion (around $12 billion) research and development initiative.\nNVIDIA has joined the coalition as a strategic technical advisor, without any financial commitments, while Qualcomm Ventures has come on board alongside six Indian venture firms, bringing additional capital commitments totaling more than $850 million.\nIndia is home to more than 180,000 startups and over 120 unicorns. In its early years, much of the ecosystem closely mirrored Western business models before evolving into SaaS companies that serve global clients, especially those in the U.S. In recent years, however, India\u2019s focus has shifted to building ventures that tackle harder, infrastructure-scale problems \u2014 from launching satellites and electrifying transportation to designing semiconductors. The Indian government has sought to accelerate this shift as major economies race to secure technological sovereignty. Yet capital for such ventures remains scarce, as they require a longer gestation period than traditional sectors and most VCs favor proven, lower-risk models.\nIn September, Silicon Valley- and India-based Celesta Capital spearheaded the launch of the India Deep Tech Alliance (IDTA) to bridge that gap, bringing together seven major U.S. and Indian investors \u2014 Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, Gaja Capital, Ideaspring Capital, Tenacity Ventures, and Venture Catalysts. The latest addition includes Indian venture firms Activate AI, Chiratae Ventures, InfoEdge Ventures, Kalaari Capital, Singularity Holdings, and YourNest Venture Capital.\nThe coalition aims to invest capital and provide mentorship and network access to Indian deep-tech startups over the next five to ten years. It also plans to collaborate with the Indian government on its policy initiatives, including the recently introduced Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) scheme.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a coalition of the willing, wanting to support the development of the Indian deep tech ecosystem,\u201d Sriram Viswanathan, founding managing partner of Celesta Capital and founding executive council member of the IDTA, said in an interview.\nApproved by the Indian cabinet earlier this year and rolled out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week, the \u20b91 trillion RDI scheme will fund projects in areas such as energy security and transition, quantum computing, robotics, space tech, biotech, and AI through long-term loans, equity infusions, and allocations to deep-tech funds of funds. The venture firms participating in the alliance plan to leverage the initiative to back Indian-domiciled deep-tech startups.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cThis is, in a way, the most seminal moment where the Indian government\u2019s action will drive creation and the formation of many of these deep tech companies and will be supported by a number of VCs in India that are really looking at developing this ecosystem,\u201d Viswanathan told TechCrunch. \u201cThere is a turning point in the Indian entrepreneurial ecosystem in favor of deep tech, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all excited about.\u201d\nImage Credits:IDTA\nThe alliance has brought in NVIDIA to provide strategic and technical guidance to its members and emerging startups. The U.S. chipmaker \u2014 whose market value has surged amid the global boom in AI \u2014 will advise on best practices for integrating NVIDIA\u2019s AI and accelerated computing platforms, offer technical talks and training through the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, and contribute to policy dialogues between industry and the government to advance India\u2019s deep-tech capabilities, the alliance said in a statement.\nAlthough NVIDIA will not participate financially, Vishal Dhupar, NVIDIA\u2019s managing director for South Asia, said the company will share technical insights and scalable computing resources with Indian startups in the coalition.\n\u201cNVIDIA\u2019s support is a pretty significant validation of the ecosystem, and them joining the IDTA is an endorsement of our collective objective that there is an opportunity for India to start seeing a burgeoning growth of this ecosystem,\u201d Viswanathan told TechCrunch.\nUnlike NVIDIA, Qualcomm is joining the alliance with an investment focus. The San Diego\u2013based chipmaker made its first India investment in 2008, with early bets including Google Maps rival MapmyIndia, which went public in late 2021. Qualcomm and Celesta also backed Indian drone maker IdeaForge, which has been a publicly listed company since 2023.\nHowever, Qualcomm\u2019s participation will extend beyond capital, said Rama Bethmangalkar, India managing director at Qualcomm Ventures. The firm plans to help startups connect with its portfolio companies, partner networks, and internal teams within Qualcomm, he told TechCrunch.\n\u201cIf you are like minded and other VCs have allocated certain portion of their resources, dollars, time, and network, it helps each other and then collectively to work with the government, to be aligned with what the government is thinking on certain areas, whether it is quantum, semiconductors, AI, or emerging technologies, it is very important to be part of that group,\u201d he said.\nThat said, the success of the IDTA remains to be seen. Viswanathan described the alliance as a \u201cloose coalition of the willing,\u201d noting that participating investors continue to run their own programs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re collaborating to share knowledge, to share deal flow, and all of that,\u201d he said when asked about the progress since the alliance\u2019s launch in September.\nIt is also unclear how much of the capital each participant will contribute.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just collectively estimating what the total commitment is to this ecosystem,\u201d Viswanathan said. \u201cThis alliance is not a fund. There\u2019s no obligation, no allocation, if you will, of any deal. If Rama finds a deal, he will do it. If Rama finds it appropriate to bring in other investors, he\u2019ll share the deal with other investors that he thinks are relevant for that investment.\u201d\nIndia\u2019s deep-tech funding rose 78% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in 2024, according to a report by IT industry body Nasscom and global consulting firm Zinnov released in April. While the growth is promising, the capital raised still trails far behind that in developed markets, especially the U.S.\nThe alliance may help increase that figure, but more importantly, it is expected to draw global attention \u2014 and, in turn, more investors and corporate venture funds \u2014 to India\u2019s startup ecosystem.\n\u201cWhat we need are role models to begin with,\u201d said Bethmangalkar. \u201cPeople are going to jump in. Entrepreneurs are going to get the confidence capital\u2026 In ten years, you\u2019ll start seeing these as the companies listed on the main boards of our exchanges \u2014 deeply science- and tech-oriented firms.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon sends legal threats to Perplexity over agentic browsing\ndescription3:\nAmazon has told Perplexity to get its agentic browser out of its online store, the companies both confirmed publicly on Tuesday. After warning Perplexity multiple times that Comet, its AI-powered shopping assistant, was violating Amazon\u2019s terms of service by not identifying itself as an agent, the e-commerce giant sent the AI search engine startup a sternly worded cease-and-desist letter, Perplexity wrote in a blog post titled \u201cBullying is not innovation.\u201d\n\u201cThis week, Perplexity received an aggressive legal threat from Amazon, demanding we prohibit Comet users from using their AI assistants on Amazon. This is Amazon\u2019s first legal salvo against an AI company, and it is a threat to all internet users,\u201d Perplexity lamented in the blog post.\nPerplexity\u2019s argument is that, since its agent is acting on behalf of a human user\u2019s direction, the agent automatically has the \u201csame permissions\u201d as the human user. The implication is that it doesn\u2019t have to identify itself as an agent.\nAmazon\u2019s response points out that other third-party agents working at the behest of human users do identify themselves. \u201cIt is how others operate, including food delivery apps and the restaurants they take orders for, delivery service apps and the stores they shop from, and online travel agencies and the airlines they book tickets with for customers,\u201d Amazon\u2019s statement explains.\nIf Amazon is to be believed, then Perplexity could simply identify its agent and start shopping. Of course, the risk is that Amazon, which has its own shopping bot called Rufus, could also block Comet \u2014 or any other third-party agentic shopper \u2014 from its site.\nAmazon suggests as much as its statement, which also says, \u201cWe think it\u2019s fairly straightforward that third-party applications that offer to make purchases on behalf of customers from other businesses should operate openly and respect service provider decisions whether or not to participate.\u201d\nPerplexity claims that Amazon would block the shopping bot because Amazon wants to sell advertising and product placements. Unlike human shoppers, a bot tasked with buying a new laundry basket presumably wouldn\u2019t find itself buying a more expensive one, or getting lured into buying the latest Brandon Sanderson novel and a new set of earphones (on sale!).\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

A few months ago, Cloudflare published research accusing Perplexity of scraping websites while specifically defying requests from websites blocking AI bots. Interestingly, many people came to Perplexity\u2019s defense that time, because this wasn\u2019t a clear-cut case of web crawler bad behavior. Cloudflare documented how the AI was accessing a specific public website when its user asked about that specific website. Perplexity fans argued that this is exactly what every human-operated web browser does.\nOn the other hand, Perplexity was using some questionable methods to do that accessing when a website opted out of bots, like hiding its identity.\nAs TechCrunch reported at the time, the Cloudflare incident foreshadowed the challenges to come if the agentic world materializes as Silicon Valley predicts it will. If consumers and companies outsource their shopping, travel bookings, and restaurant reservations to bots, will it be in the best interest of websites to block bots entirely? How will they allow and work with them?\nPerplexity may be right in that Amazon is setting a precedent. As the 800-pound gorilla in e-commerce, it is clearly saying that the way this should work is for an agent to identify itself and let the website decide.\n\ntitle4:\nBeta Technologies ends first day on NYSE in the green and $1B raised\ndescription4:\nShares of electric aviation startup Beta Technologies took flight Tuesday as the company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange with an outsized raise of $1 billion and a stock price that closed up.\nThe Vermont-based company priced shares in its IPO at $34, above its predicted range of $27 to $33. Beta Technologies sold 29.9 million shares to raise more $1 billion at a valuation of $7.4 billion.\nOnce trading started, shares of Beta Technologies dipped before recovering and ultimately closing at $36.\nBeta Technologies\u2019 public market debut is a capstone to founder and CEO Kyle Clark\u2019s untraditional approach to building an aviation company. Clark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, founded Beta Technologies in 2017. He didn\u2019t take the typical path of a startup founder, eschewing Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and bypassing venture capital. Instead, Beta has raised funds \u2014 to the tune of $1.15 billion \u2014 from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority. Amazon and General Electric are among Beta\u2019s biggest investors.\nIn another uncommon move, the company filed its IPO paperwork despite the government shutdown. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance last month that lets companies in IPO limbo issue statements, including share price, that become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nThe decision to proceed under this SEC guidance would mean a 20-day roadshow with investors, Clark told TechCrunch, adding that bank advisers told him being on the road that long was risky.\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018You know what? It actually is not. I think the more time we spend with investors, the better this is going to be for Beta,\u2019\u201d Clark said in an interview Monday evening. \u201cAs people started to dig really deep into the tech and the strategy, we got stronger and stronger, and our oversubscription speaks for itself.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nHis hope, he told TechCrunch, is for steady and slow growth of the stock, not a wild, uncontrolled pop.\nNow Clark says he is focused back on the company, including the commercial certification of its electric aircraft with the Federal Aviation Administration.\nBeta aims to be an OEM to the aviation sector. The company has designed two electric aircraft. A conventional electric aircraft, called the Alia CX300 eCTOL, is designed for regional flight. An electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, dubbed the Alia A250 eVTOL, is primed for urban environments.\nBeta has also built an EV aircraft charging business, of which Archer Aviation is a customer.\nBeta\u2019s IPO regulatory documents show it has generated revenue but is still not near profitability. Beta brought in $15.6 million in the first half of 2025, double the revenue from the same period in 2024. Its net losses have also grown by roughly one-third to $183 million over the first six months of the year.\"\n\nResponse:",
