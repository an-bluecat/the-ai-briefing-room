Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday April 7), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTechCrunch Mobility: Tesla takes a hit, tariff chaos begins, and one EV startup hits a milestone\ndescription0:\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\nOver the 13 years reporting on Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, I have watched the rise, fall, near misses, and rise again of the company and its billionaire leader. Musk, known for his willingness to take risks, has admitted how close the company came to filing for bankruptcy before turning it all around.\nIt was that \u201cus versus them\u201d storyline that helped turn Musk into a symbol of innovation.\nHis political alignment with President Trump, and more importantly, his activities as the unofficial leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, has changed public perception of Musk. But it\u2019s Tesla that is taking the biggest hit, including a drop in Q1 sales, global Tesla Takedown protests, and a falling stock price. And automakers, which have long trailed Tesla in EV sales, are taking advantage of this opening by offering sweet trade-in deals and other incentives.\nSenior reporter Rebecca Bellan has documented the moments over the past several months that have affected Tesla. Her article will be periodically updated, so be sure to check back.\nCan Tesla rebound? The recent tariffs announced by Trump could help Tesla since its vehicles \u2014 and many of its components \u2014 are made here in the United States. It still might not be enough protection to stop the bleeding. And tariffs will likely hurt Tesla\u2019s energy-storage business.\nThe chaos surrounding the tariffs implemented by Trump will linger. We\u2019re just starting to see how automakers are reacting and adjusting. Some, like Ford, are trying to get ahead and provide discounts to boost sales in the short term. And Volkswagen has told dealerships it plans to add an import fee to the price of imported cars sold in the United States, per The New York Times.\nA little bird\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nA little bird told us that while Tesla definitely appears poised to launch a robotaxi service in Austin this summer, the automaker\u2019s outreach to the city has been slim. Others like Waymo and Cruise (back when Cruise was a thing) have tried to get off on the right foot by connecting with as many city stakeholders as possible before launching.\nSome government officials also shared safety concerns around Tesla\u2019s brand of autonomy. They worry Tesla\u2019s cars might have a more limited awareness of surroundings since they only rely on cameras, rather than lidar and radar, for perception.\nGot a tip for us?

Still, there were a few worth noting.\nEVident Battery, a Massachusetts-based advanced battery inspection tech startup, raised $3.2 million in a seed funding round led by Ibex Investors. Nationwide Ventures, Automotive Ventures, and Avesta Fund also joined.\nFourier, the hydrogen startup, raised $18.5 million in a Series A round led by General Catalyst and Paramark Ventures. Other participating investors include Airbus Ventures, Borusan Ventures, GSBackers, MCJ Collective, and Positive Ventures.\nWindrose Technology, an EV maker based in Belgium and with Chinese roots, plans to file for an IPO in the U.S. to $400 million, The New York Times reported.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nAutonomous vehicles\nTechCrunch reporter Maxwell Zeff interviewed San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and autonomous vehicles do come up. Check out the video here.\nUber has partnered with Dubai\u2019s Road and Transport Authority in a deal that paves the way for the company to operate AVs in the United Arab Emirates city. Uber doesn\u2019t have its own AVs, so it will rely on partnerships. Its first in Dubai will be with Chinese company WeRide.\nSpeaking of WeRide, the AV company has obtained a driverless public road testing and operating permit in France.\nElectric vehicles, charging, & batteries\nHarbinger, a medium-duty EV manufacturer, officially started production and has manufactured its first 100 salable units, the company told TechCrunch. It\u2019s a notable milestone for the California-based startup, which was founded in 2021. Those vehicles will be headed to several customers, including RV giant Thor Industries.\nMeanwhile, Harbinger has also inserted itself into the bankruptcy proceedings of EV startup Canoo. Harbinger filed an objection to the sale of Canoo\u2019s assets to its CEO, potentially throwing a wrench into the 2-month-old bankruptcy case.\nRivian delivered just 8,640 vehicles in the first three months of 2025, the company\u2019s worst quarterly mark since the end of 2022. The company says it still expects to deliver between 46,000 and 51,000 EVs by the end of 2025.\nRedwood Materials, the battery materials and recycling startup founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, opened a research and development center in San Francisco. The 15,000-square-foot facility located in the city\u2019s Design District is equipped with lab space to support engineers who will eventually work on every point of the battery ecosystem, from chemical engineering and cathode science to software and electrical engineering.\n\ntitle1:\nGitHub Copilot introduces new limits, charges for 'premium' AI models\ndescription1:\nGitHub Copilot, Microsoft-owned GitHub\u2019s AI coding assistant, could soon become costlier for some users.\nOn Friday, GitHub announced \u201cpremium requests\u201d for GitHub Copilot, a new system that imposes rate limits when users switch to AI models other than the base model for tasks such as \u201cagentic\u201d coding and multi-file edits. While GitHub Copilot subscribers can still take unlimited actions with the base model (OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o), tasks and actions with newer models, like Anthropic\u2019s 3.7 Sonnet, will now be capped.\nCustomers on the Copilot Pro ($20 per month) tier will receive 300 monthly premium requests beginning on May 5, GitHub said in a blog post. As for Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise users, they\u2019ll receive 300 and 1,000 monthly premium requests, respectively, starting between May 12 and May 19.\nCustomers on any of those plans can purchase additional premium requests at $0.04 per request or upgrade to GitHub\u2019s new Copilot Pro+ plan. Starting at $39 per month, Copilot Pro+ offers 1,500 premium requests and \u201caccess to the best models,\u201d GitHub says, including OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5.\nThe effective price hike for Copilot\u2019s more capable models, which comes a day after AI coding platform Devin increased rates for some users, is perhaps a reflection of the higher computing costs these models incur. Reasoning models like 3.7 Sonnet take more time to fact-check their answers, making them more reliable \u2014 but also increasing the computing needed to run them.\nYet Copilot isn\u2019t unprofitable. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last August that Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub\u2019s revenue growth in 2024 and is already a larger business than all of GitHub when the tech giant acquired it roughly seven years ago.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI's models 'memorized' copyrighted content, new study suggests\ndescription2:\nA new study appears to lend credence to allegations that OpenAI trained at least some of its AI models on copyrighted content.\nOpenAI is embroiled in suits brought by authors, programmers, and other rights-holders who accuse the company of using their works \u2014 books, codebases, and so on \u2014 to develop its models without permission. OpenAI has long claimed a fair use defense, but the plaintiffs in these cases argue that there isn\u2019t a carve-out in U.S. copyright law for training data.\nThe study, which was co-authored by researchers at the University of Washington, the University of Copenhagen, and Stanford, proposes a new method for identifying training data \u201cmemorized\u201d by models behind an API, like OpenAI\u2019s.\nModels are prediction engines. Trained on a lot of data, they learn patterns \u2014 that\u2019s how they\u2019re able to generate essays, photos, and more. Most of the outputs aren\u2019t verbatim copies of the training data, but owing to the way models \u201clearn,\u201d some inevitably are. Image models have been found to regurgitate screenshots from movies they were trained on, while language models have been observed effectively plagiarizing news articles.\nThe study\u2019s method relies on words that the co-authors call \u201chigh-surprisal\u201d \u2014 that is, words that stand out as uncommon in the context of a larger body of work. For example, the word \u201cradar\u201d in the sentence \u201cJack and I sat perfectly still with the radar humming\u201d would be considered high-surprisal because it\u2019s statistically less likely than words such as \u201cengine\u201d or \u201cradio\u201d to appear before \u201chumming.\u201d\nThe co-authors probed several OpenAI models, including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, for signs of memorization by removing high-surprisal words from snippets of fiction books and New York Times pieces and having the models try to \u201cguess\u201d which words had been masked. If the models managed to guess correctly, it\u2019s likely they memorized the snippet during training, concluded the co-authors.\nAn example of having a model \u201cguess\u201d a high-surprisal word. Image Credits:OpenAI\nAccording to the results of the tests, GPT-4 showed signs of having memorized portions of popular fiction books, including books in a dataset containing samples of copyrighted ebooks called BookMIA. The results also suggested that the model memorized portions of New York Times articles, albeit at a comparatively lower rate.\nAbhilasha Ravichander, a doctoral student at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study, told TechCrunch that the findings shed light on the \u201ccontentious data\u201d models might have been trained on.\n\u201cIn order to have large language models that are trustworthy, we need to have models that we can probe and audit and examine scientifically,\u201d Ravichander said. \u201cOur work aims to provide a tool to probe large language models, but there is a real need for greater data transparency in the whole ecosystem.\u201d\nOpenAI has long advocated for looser restrictions on developing models using copyrighted data. While the company has certain content licensing deals in place and offers opt-out mechanisms that allow copyright owners to flag content they\u2019d prefer the company not use for training purposes, it has lobbied several governments to codify \u201cfair use\u201d rules around AI training approaches.\n\ntitle3:\nChatGPT adoption skyrockets in India, but monetization may be trailing\ndescription3:\nFor years, U.S.-based tech companies have tapped into India\u2019s vast and increasing internet user base for growth. OpenAI is no exception. But while the AI lab claims that India is one of its fastest-growing ChatGPT markets, third-party data suggests that OpenAI may be struggling to turn that momentum into revenue.\nAccording to analytics firm SensorTower, users in India have spent $8 million on ChatGPT subscriptions through in-app purchases since 2023. That doesn\u2019t include purchases made through the ChatGPT web app. But notably, it\u2019s a fraction of the $330 million SensorTower estimates U.S. users have spent on ChatGPT in-app.\nOne likely factor is the lack of local pricing for India. OpenAI\u2019s cheapest ChatGPT plan in the country costs $20 (more than \u20b91,700) per month, which is considered expensive for a digital subscription in India.\nWhen contacted, OpenAI did not share specific details about its growth in India but pointed us to a recent post on X by COO Brad Lightcap, which claims that India is ChatGPT\u2019s fastest-growing market.\nLow as the revenue might be at present, India may still end up being a major growth driver for OpenAI. The company\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, recently expressed a desire for OpenAI to become a multi-billion-user platform. Tapping into India\u2019s over 950 million internet users could help bootstrap that effort.\nOpenAI apparently thinks so. The company is reportedly courting an alliance with Reliance Jio, one of India\u2019s biggest mobile carriers, to get ChatGPT in front of more users.\nIn the meantime, ChatGPT continues to grow organically in India.\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\nAccording to data from app tracker Appfigures, more than 20% of ChatGPT Android app downloads this year so far have been in India. At least a portion of that growth was fueled by the recently released revamped image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for its ability to create realistic Ghibli-style art.\nFor context, ChatGPT has more than 500 million weekly users globally.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI says it'll release o3 after all, delays GPT-5\ndescription4:\nAfter effectively canceling the consumer launch of its o3 reasoning model in February, OpenAI now says it aims to release both o3 and a next-gen successor, o4-mini, in \u201ca couple of weeks.\u201d\nIn a post on X on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the reversal in course is related to OpenAI\u2019s upcoming GPT-5, which the company has previously said will be a unified model incorporating reasoning capabilities.\n\u201c[W]e are going to be able to make GPT-5 much better than we originally thought,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201c[W]e also found it harder than we thought it was going to be to smoothly integrate everything. [A]nd we want to make sure we have enough capacity to support what we expect to be unprecedented demand.\u201d\nAltman added that OpenAI expects to roll out GPT-5 \u201cin a few months\u201d \u2014 later than originally anticipated.\nTo the extent that OpenAI has published details about GPT-5, the company has said it intends to offer unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the \u201cstandard intelligence setting\u201d subject to \u201cabuse thresholds.\u201d ChatGPT Plus customers will be able to run GPT-5 at a \u201chigher level of intelligence,\u201d while subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Pro plan will be able to run GPT-5 at an \u201ceven higher level of intelligence.\u201d\n\u201c[GPT-5] will incorporate voice, Canvas, search, deep research, and more,\u201d Altman wrote in an X post early this year, referring to a range of features OpenAI has launched in ChatGPT over the past several months. \u201c[A] top goal for us is to unify [our] models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.\u201d\nOpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rivals such as Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that have adopted an \u201copen\u201d approach to launching models. In contrast to OpenAI\u2019s strategy, these \u201copen\u201d competitors make their models available to the AI community for experimentation and, in some cases, commercialization.\nIn addition to o3, an \u201co3 pro\u201d model, o4-mini, and GPT-5, OpenAI plans to debut its first open language model since GPT\u20112 in the coming months. This model will have reasoning capabilities, Altman said earlier this week, and will be subject to additional safety evaluations.\"\n\nResponse:",
