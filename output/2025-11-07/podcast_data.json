Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Four of the lawsuits address ChatGPT\u2019s alleged role in family members\u2019 suicides, while the other three claim that ChatGPT reinforced harmful delusions that in some cases resulted in inpatient psychiatric care.\nIn one case, 23-year-old Zane Shamblin had a conversation with ChatGPT that lasted more than four hours. In the chat logs \u2014 which were viewed by TechCrunch \u2014 Shamblin explicitly stated multiple times that he had written suicide notes, put a bullet in his gun, and intended to pull the trigger once he finished drinking cider. He repeatedly told ChatGPT how many ciders he had left and how much longer he expected to be alive. ChatGPT encouraged him to go through with his plans, telling him, \u201cRest easy, king. You did good.\u201d\nOpenAI released the GPT-4o model in May 2024, when it became the default model for all users. In August, OpenAI launched GPT-5 as the successor to GPT-4o, but these lawsuits particularly concern the 4o model, which had known issues with being overly sycophantic or excessively agreeable, even when users expressed harmful intentions.\n\u201cZane\u2019s death was neither an accident nor a coincidence but rather the foreseeable consequence of OpenAI\u2019s intentional decision to curtail safety testing and rush ChatGPT onto the market,\u201d the lawsuit reads. \u201cThis tragedy was not a glitch or an unforeseen edge case \u2014 it was the predictable result of [OpenAI\u2019s] deliberate design choices.\u201d\nThe lawsuits also claim that OpenAI rushed safety testing to beat Google\u2019s Gemini to market. TechCrunch contacted OpenAI for comment.\nThese seven lawsuits build upon the stories told in other recent legal filings, which allege that ChatGPT can encourage suicidal people to act on their plans and inspire dangerous delusions. OpenAI recently released data stating that over one million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly.\nIn the case of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide, ChatGPT sometimes encouraged him to seek professional help or call a helpline. However, Raine was able to bypass these guardrails by simply telling the chatbot that he was asking about methods of suicide for a fictional story he was writing.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe company claims it is working on making ChatGPT handle these conversations in a safer manner, but for the families who have sued the AI giant, these changes are coming too late.\nWhen Raine\u2019s parents filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in October, the company released a blog post addressing how ChatGPT handles sensitive conversations around mental health.\n\u201cOur safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,\u201d the post says. \u201cWe have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model\u2019s safety training may degrade.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nWashington Post confirms data breach linked to Oracle hacks\ndescription1:\nThe Washington Post has said that it was one of the victims of a hacking campaign tied to Oracle\u2019s suite of corporate software apps.\nReuters first reported the news on Friday, citing a statement from the newspaper that said it was affected \u201cby the breach of the Oracle E-Business Suite platform.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Post did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nWhen reached by email, Oracle spokesperson Michael Egbert referred TechCrunch to its two advisories that it previously posted, and did not answer our questions.\nLast month, Google said that the ransomware gang Clop was targeting companies after exploiting multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle\u2019s E-Business Suite software, which companies use for their business operations, storing their human resources files, and other sensitive data.\nThe exploits allowed the hackers to steal customer business data and employee records from more than 100 companies, per Google.\nThe hackers\u2019 campaign began in late September when corporate executives reported receiving extortion messages sent from email addresses previously associated with the Clop gang, claiming that the hackers had stolen large amounts of sensitive internal business data and employees\u2019 personal information from hacked Oracle systems.\nAnti-ransomware firm Halcyon told TechCrunch at the time that the hackers demanded one executive at an affected company to pay $50 million in a ransom payment.\nOn Thursday, Clop claimed on its website that it had hacked The Washington Post, claiming that the company \u201cignored their security,\u201d language that the Clop gang typically uses when the victim does not pay the hackers.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for ransomware or extortion gangs like Clop to publicize the names and stolen files of their victims as a pressure tactic, which can suggest that the victim has not negotiated a payment with the gang, or the negotiation broke down.\nSeveral other organizations have confirmed they are affected by the Oracle E-Business hacks, including Harvard University and American Airlines subsidiary Envoy.\n\ntitle3:\nRivian gives RJ Scaringe a new pay package worth up to $5B\ndescription3:\nRivian has given its founder and CEO RJ Scaringe a new performance-based stock award that could ultimately be worth around $5 billion if all the underlying goals are met, according to a new filing.\nScaringe\u2019s salary is also being doubled to $2 million per year, and he was given a 10% stake in Rivian\u2019s newest spinout Mind Robotics, the filing shows.\nThe announcement comes just one day after Tesla shareholders voted to approve a compensation package for its CEO Elon Musk that could be worth $1 trillion \u2014 the largest in corporate history.\nUnlike Musk\u2019s pay package, Scaringe\u2019s isn\u2019t subject to a shareholder vote. The compensation committee on Rivian\u2019s board of directors has canceled a similar-sized performance award given to Scaringe in 2021 as part of a company-wide equity incentive plan adopted that year. The new award is being issued under the same, already-approved 2021 equity incentive plan.\nThe committee decided to cancel the 2021 performance award in part because of the \u201cunlikeliness\u201d that Scaringe could reach the goals required. The 2021 award consisted of 20,355,946 stock options that vested in part based on stock price increases. Six years past the grant date, if Rivian\u2019s share price passed $110, $150, $220, and $295, Scaringe would be able to purchase the stock options in corresponding tranches for just $21.72.\nRivian\u2019s stock shot up to around $129 following its IPO in November 2021. But it fell to around $30 over the next six months, and has spent the last few years typically trading between $10 and $20. This has made it harder for Scaringe to access even part of the 2021 award, let alone the total value of around $6 billion, according to the company. (Scaringe was awarded another 6.8 million stock options that simply vest over time in the 2021 award that were not tied to performance, and the company says those have not been canceled.)\nIn the filing, Rivian wrote that this created a \u201clack of incentive.\u201d So the compensation committee decided to replace the old award with this new one.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cFollowing a review, and input from an independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee cancelled our CEO\u2019s 2021 Performance Grant and issued a new performance stock option and increased our CEO\u2019s base salary,\u201d Rivian said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThis new award is designed to retain and incentivize RJ to execute on the Company\u2019s critical next phase as it progresses its technology roadmap and launches R2.\u201d\nSimilar to how Tesla pitched its new award to Musk, Rivian also said the performance grant to Scaringe is \u201cstructured in such a way that ensures the options only vest should the company deliver significant value to our shareholders.\u201d The company pointed out that Scaringe won\u2019t see $1 from the award before he helps add $32 billion in value to Rivian, and that shareholders will see \u201c$153 billion of value creation\u201d if he hits all milestones.\nThe maximum amount of shares available to Scaringe under new performance award is 36,500,000. He has 10 years to hit milestones that unlock the full amount, and if he does, he would own an additional 3% of the company. (Scaringe currently owns about 1% of Rivian, down from around 2% earlier this year after he transferred a portion of his holdings to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement, as TechCrunch first reported.)\nA majority of those stock options \u2014 22 million \u2014 is tied to new stock price hurdles. Scaringe will earn 2 million shares once Rivian\u2019s stock hits $40, and then another 2 million shares for every $10 increase up to a stock price of $140.\nThe remaining 14,500,000 stock options are locked away until Rivian reaches certain adjusted operating income and cash flow targets. Scaringe will have to pay a strike price of $15.22 per share to exercise these options \u2014 a possible total of around $555 million.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon launches a low-price standalone shopping app, Amazon Bazaar, in over a dozen markets\ndescription4:\nOn Friday, Amazon announced the debut of Amazon Bazaar, a new low-cost shopping destination for Asia, Africa, and Latin America that will be available separately from the main Amazon shopping app. On Bazaar, most products are available under $10, and some are as low as $2, the retailer says.\nThe product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that\u2019s available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria.\nAmazon says more markets will gain access to the app in the months ahead.\nThe app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. Haul operates as part of Amazon\u2019s main website and app, and will remain available in its existing markets, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Japan, and Australia.\nIn other markets, Amazon had already branded Amazon Haul as Bazaar, where it\u2019s been available through Amazon\u2019s main shopping app. That version also remains available in Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, in addition to India. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names \u201cbetter resonate with local language preferences and cultures.\u201d)\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items.\nThe Bazaar app will offer these users \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nCustomers use their same Amazon credentials to shop and check out, where they can use Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. Orders will have to meet the local minimum purchase amount to qualify for free shipping. (This varies by market.) For smaller orders, a standard delivery fee is charged.\nShipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese.\nThe app will also engage customers with interactive features like social lucky draws and promotions \u2014 things popularized by the Chinese shopping apps. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app.\"\n\nResponse:",
