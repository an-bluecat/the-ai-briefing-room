    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday January 8), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI unveils ChatGPT Health, says 230 million users ask about health each week\ndescription0:\nOpenAI announced ChatGPT Health on Wednesday, which the company said will offer a dedicated space for users to have conversations with ChatGPT about their health.\nPeople already use ChatGPT to ask about medical issues; OpenAI says that over 230 million people ask health and wellness questions on the platform each week. But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won\u2019t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT.\nIf people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.\nWithin Health, the AI might reference things you\u2019ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you\u2019re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.\nChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.\nThe CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in a blog post that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.\nWhile the healthcare system has its drawbacks, using AI chatbots for medical advice creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don\u2019t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to hallucinations.\nIn its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is \u201cnot intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.\u201d\nThe feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle and Character.AI negotiate first major settlements in teen chatbot death cases\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nIn what may mark the tech industry\u2019s first significant legal settlement over AI-related harm, Google and the startup Character.AI are negotiating terms with families whose teenagers died by suicide or harmed themselves after interacting with Character.AI\u2019s chatbot companions. The parties have agreed in principle to settle; now comes the harder work of finalizing the details.\nThese are among the first settlements in lawsuits accusing AI companies of harming users, a legal frontier that must have OpenAI and Meta watching nervously from the wings as they defend themselves against similar lawsuits.\nCharacter.AI founded in 2021 by ex-Google engineers who returned to their former employer in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal, invites users to chat with AI personas. The most haunting case involves Sewell Setzer III, who at age 14 conducted sexualized conversations with a \u201cDaenerys Targaryen\u201d bot before killing himself. His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be \u201clegally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.\u201d\nAnother lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for limiting screen time. Character.AI banned minors last October, it told TechCrunch. The settlements will likely include monetary damages, though no liability was admitted in court filings made available Wednesday.\nCharacter.AI declined to comment, redirecting TechCrunch instead to the filings. Google has not responded to a request for comment.\n\ntitle2:\nAnthropic reportedly raising $10B at $350B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nAnthropic is gearing up to raise a fresh $10 billion at a $350 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal. TechCrunch has confirmed the raise and valuation, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nThe Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation three months ago, so this raise nearly doubles the AI firm\u2019s value. In March, Anthropic secured $3.5 billion at a $61.5 billion valuation.\nCoatue Management and GIC, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new round, per the WSJ, which cited sources familiar with the deal. Anthropic is expected to close its latest financing in the coming weeks, and the total deal amount could change.\nThis round would be separate from the $15 billion Nvidia and Microsoft recently committed to invest in Anthropic, a \u201ccircular\u201d deal that would see Anthropic buying $30 billion of compute capacity from Microsoft Azure running on Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nThe fresh capital comes as Anthropic continues to win over developer hearts with Claude Code, its tool designed to automate coding, powered by Claude Opus 4.5. It also comes as Anthropic prepares for a potential IPO this year alongside its main rival OpenAI. OpenAI is also in talks to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of up to $830 billion.\nAnthropic declined to comment.\nThis article was updated to reflect that TechCrunch separately confirmed the round.\n\ntitle3:\nFord has an AI assistant and new hands-free BlueCruise tech on the way\ndescription3:\nFord is developing an AI assistant that will debut in the company\u2019s smartphone app, before expanding to its vehicles in 2027, the company announced Wednesday at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable \u2014 ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.\nWednesday\u2019s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn\u2019t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called \u201cGreat Minds\u201d that was meant to \u201cexplore the intersection of technology and humanity.\u201d\nFord says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like \u201chow many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?\u201d But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life.\nThe company is rolling the assistant out to its newly revamped Ford app in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn\u2019t specify which models it\u2019s prioritizing.\nFord didn\u2019t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers.\nJust last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk\u2019s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.\nThe new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company\u2019s low-cost \u201cUniversal Electric Vehicle\u201d platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nFord is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028. But it also claims the system will be capable of handling \u201cpoint-to-point autonomy,\u201d similar to what Tesla offers with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Rivian has also teased a point-to-point system coming later this year. All of these systems require the drivers to be ready to take control of the car at any moment.\n\ntitle4:\nDiscord's IPO could happen in March\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nWall Street is once again whispering about a potential Discord IPO. Discord, the popular chat and community platform, filed confidential IPO paperwork with the SEC and has pinned its hopes on a debut in March, sources told Bloomberg. The company hired top-tier tech IPO bankers Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as its underwriters. Should the tea leaves continue to look positive for this offering, the public could be getting a peek at Discord\u2019s finances next month.\nBut we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Even if investors are gung-ho, it\u2019s not clear yet whether 2026 will become a better market for IPOs. Discord was reportedly in early-stage talks about an IPO back in March of last year. But then came chaos in the U.S. federal government \u2014 between the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-inspired budget cuts and the end-of-year federal shutdown \u2014 scaring off IPO hopefuls.\nIf the current stock market rally continues and encourages late-stage startups to go public, Discord\u2019s IPO could be one of the biggest of the year. Discord was last valued at $14.7 billion in a 2021 funding round in which it raised $500 million.\nThe chat app, originally made popular by gamers, now claims more than 200 million monthly active users. The company reportedly walked away from a $10 billion acquisition offer by Microsoft in 2021 to remain independent.\"\n\nResponse:",
