Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

It offers AI training and inference cloud services built upon a growing stockpile of Nvidia GPUs. One of its investors is Nvidia, which helps it obtain the precious, short-in-supply chips.\nCoreWeave has both Microsoft and OpenAI as customers \u2014 the latter signed a deal to buy $12 billion worth of services and still has about $11 billion worth to buy. And Nvidia increased its stake after the IPO, the company disclosed.\nCoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator. Image Credits:CoreWeave\nBut CoreWeave borrows money against the GPUs to pay for them, and its IPO wasn\u2019t big enough to get it out of that cycle. It\u2019s got about $8.8 billion worth of debt as of March, it disclosed, with interest rates as high as 15%. Even though it brought in almost $1 billion in revenue in Q1 alone ($985 million), it recorded a net loss of about $315 million.\nThat has not scared away investors, who remain eager for ways to make money on AI. CoreWeave\u2019s stock has soared almost 300% since its March IPO, raising Intrator\u2019s net worth to above $10 billion, Bloomberg calculates.\nBut the wildest part of Intrator\u2019s history, as well as that of his co-founders Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee, is that the whole thing started out as a make-money-quick, crypto mining enterprise when their previous company, a hedge fund, failed.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe business partners went from a closet full of GPUs to thousands of them in a New Jersey warehouse, to an AI training experiment with an open source LLM group, EleutherAI, Venturo previously told TechCrunch.\nToday, the company is servicing the biggest LLM players on the planet, reportedly seeking to buy its competitor Core Scientific, and the founders are billionaires. And, as we previously reported, it\u2019s not all paper money. All three founders pocketed over $150 million apiece by cashing out of shares ahead of the IPO.\nCoreWeave remains a symbol of the AI industry in 2025: Massive, fast-growing revenue and investor enthusiasm built on an insatiable need for more resources.\nCoreWeave declined additional comment.\n\ntitle1:\nTravis Kalanick is trying to buy Pony AI - and Uber might help\ndescription1:\nUber founder Travis Kalanick is looking for ways to buy the U.S. arm of Chinese autonomous vehicle company Pony AI, according to The New York Times. Kalanick is reportedly working with investors to finance an acquisition, and Uber may even help make the transaction happen, the Times reports.\nPony AI went public last year and had a market cap of around $4.5 billion before The New York Times report was published. The report states that Pony started preparing its U.S. arm for a sale or spinoff in 2022, down to creating a \u201cforked\u201d version of its source code.\nAcquiring Pony AI would bring Kalanick back into the world of self-driving vehicles for the first time since he was pushed out of Uber in 2017.\nUber was working on its own autonomous vehicle technology at that time. In 2018, one of its test vehicles killed a pedestrian in Arizona. Kalanick\u2019s replacement, Dara Khosrowshahi, ultimately sold Uber\u2019s self-driving division to autonomous trucking startup Aurora. Under Khosrowshahi, Uber has taken a partnership approach, bringing self-driving cars onto its platform from companies like Waymo.\nKalanick has increasingly embraced robotics in recent years while running his ghost kitchen company CloudKitchens. He would reportedly still run CloudKitchens day-to-day if he purchased Pony AI.\nIn March, Kalanick said at an event that Uber was \u201creally only behind Waymo but probably catching up\u201d at the time that he was pushed out of Uber. (Uber and Waymo eventually got locked in a legal battle over autonomous vehicle-related trade secrets that was ultimately settled.) Regarding Khosrowshahi\u2019s decision to sell the division, Kalanick said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t running the company when that happened, but you know, you could say, \u2018Wish we had an autonomous ride-sharing product right now. That would be great.\u2019\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nHomeland Security warns of Iran-backed cyberattacks targeting US networks\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nA bulletin issued Sunday by U.S. Homeland Security said it expects to see Iranian government-backed hackers conduct attacks against U.S. networks, amid the ongoing conflict between the U.S. and Israel and Iran.\nThe National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin said low-level cyberattacks by hacktivists are \u201clikely,\u201d adding that hacktivists and government-linked hackers \u201croutinely target\u201d poorly secured U.S. networks and internet-connected devices to cause disruption.\nThe bulletin was published days after a series of U.S. and Israeli air strikes targeted Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which appeared to coincide with destructive hacks carried out by a pro-Israel hacking group, dubbed Predatory Sparrow. The hackers took out one of Iran\u2019s top banks and destroyed millions in cryptocurrency held by the country\u2019s largest crypto exchange.\nFollowing the initial round of Israeli air strikes, the Iranian government confirmed it shut down the country\u2019s internet to protect against cyberattacks.\nIran is known for its offensive cyber capabilities, including long-running espionage operations targeting senior U.S. politicians and government officials, as well as disruptive cyberattacks designed to steal data from businesses and tech giants, often by using known vulnerabilities or stolen passwords.\n\ntitle3:\nApple updates the rules for its EU App Store by adding more complicated fees\ndescription3:\nApple on Thursday announced a series of updates to its developer policies to comply with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA). The news, which was expected, arrived just in time to meet the deadline of June 26, after which the iPhone maker would risk new fines. The changes involve both how app developers can communicate with their customers and the fees Apple charges.\nEU regulators had earlier fined Apple \u20ac500 million for noncompliance with the DMA and were threatening to impose further penalties, forcing Apple\u2019s hand.\nIn terms of Apple\u2019s new \u201canti-steering\u201d rules, which dictate customer communications, EU app developers will now be able to link to alternative ways to pay for subscriptions and other in-app purchases outside the App Store across any channel. That means they can share this link on a website, an alternative app marketplace, within another app, and more. These links can also be accessed outside the app or within the app using a web view or native experience, Apple said, and don\u2019t have to use warning screens or the text that Apple previously required.\nIn addition, instead of dropping its Core Technology Fee (CTF), Apple introduced a more complex fee structure.\nThere\u2019s now an initial acquisition fee (2%) and a store services fee. The latter is either 13% or 5%, depending on the tier the developer chooses. (Small Business program members pay 10%.) Tier 1 developers have access to a more limited set of App Store services, including app reviews, manual updates, and antifraud measures. Tier 2 provides access to marketing tools, automatic updates, curation and personalization features, app insights, and more.\nThen, for apps that want to link to alternative methods of payment via the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement (EU) Addendum, there\u2019s a Core Technology Commission (CTC). This will ultimately replace the CTF.\nBefore today, the developers paid the CTF of \u20ac0.50 for each app install after the app topped 1 million downloads. That will continue for developers on the alternative EU business terms.\nFor developers on the standard terms in the EU, the CTC \u2014 a 5% commission \u2014 will instead apply. Developers who currently pay the old CTF will move to the new rules by January 1, 2026.\n\u201cThe CTC reflects the value Apple provides developers through ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company sued Apple and won the right to use alternative payments without a commission in the U.S., reacted to the news on X, calling it more malicious compliance from Apple.\n\u201cApple\u2019s new Digital Markets Act malicious compliance scheme is blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States and makes a mockery of fair competition in digital markets. Apps with competing payments are not only taxed but commercially crippled in the App Store,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle4:\nRedwood Materials launches energy storage business and its first target is AI data centers\ndescription4:\nTucked between two massive buildings in the hills of the Nevada desert, 805 retired EV batteries lie in neat formation, each one wrapped in nondescript white tarps \u2014 and hiding in plain sight.\nA passerby might not realize this unassuming array is the largest microgrid in North America, that it\u2019s powering a 2,000 GPU modular data center for AI infrastructure company Crusoe, or that it represents the next big act of JB Straubel, the co-founder and CEO of Redwood Materials.\nRedwood Materials announced Thursday during an event at its Sparks, Nevada facility that it was launching an energy storage business that will leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery recycling business to provide power to companies, starting with AI data centers.\nThe new business, called Redwood Energy, is kicking off with partner Crusoe, a startup Straubel invested in 2021. The old EVs, which are not yet ready for recycling, store energy generated from an adjacent solar array. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, the AI infrastructure company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas \u2014 the initial site of the Stargate project.\nThe scale of Redwood\u2019s battery collection operation is staggering. Redwood said it recovers more than 70% of all used or discarded battery packs in North America. Today, it processes more than 20 GWh of batteries annually\u2014the equivalent of 250,000 EVs. It has apparently been stockpiling batteries that aren\u2019t ready for recycling, with more than 1 gigawatt-hour worth in its inventory already. In the coming months, it expects to receive another 4 gigawatt-hours.\nBy 2028, the company said it plans to deploy 20 gigawatt-hours of grid-scale storage, placing it on track to become the largest repurposer of used EV battery packs.\nStraubel\u2019s confidence in the endeavor was apparent in every detail of the launch event. To illustrate the commitment of Redwood \u2014 and by extension, Straubel \u2014 everything about the production, from the lights and music to the projection on the big screen were powered by the microgrid.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe wanted to go all in,\u201d Straubel said, breaking into a wide, toothy smile. Splashy effects for the event aside, the microgrid setup with Crusoe is not a demonstration project. Straubel said this is a revenue-generating operation, which was constructed in four months, and one that is profitable. He added that even more of these will be deployed with other customers this year.\n\u201cI think this has the potential to grow faster than the core recycling business,\u201d he said.\nRedwood Materials has been on an expansion tear in recent years. The company, which has raised $2 billion in private funds, was founded in 2017 by Straubel, the former Tesla CTO and current board member, to create a circular supply chain.\nThe company started by recycling scrap from battery cell production as well as consumer electronics like cell phone batteries and laptop computers. After processing these discarded goods and extracting materials like cobalt, nickel and lithium that are typically mined, Redwood supplies those back to Panasonic and other customers. Over time, the company has expanded beyond recycling and into cathode production. Redwood generated $200 million in revenue in 2024, much of which comes from the sale of battery materials like cathodes.\nThe company\u2019s footprint has grown too, and well beyond its Carson City, Nevada headquarters. It has locked up deals with Toyota, Panasonic, and GM, started construction on a South Carolina factory, and made an acquisition in Europe.\nRedwood Energy is the next step \u2014 and one that isn\u2019t tied to setting up its systems to be off-grid. The retired EV batteries can be powered by wind and solar, or they can be tied to the grid. In the case of the Crusoe project, the system is powered by solar.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no green intent required here,\u201d CTO Colin Campbell said during a tour of the microgrid. \u201cIt\u2019s a good economic choice that also happens to be carbon-free.\u201d\nThe business model addresses a longstanding challenge in the energy storage sector. For over a decade, companies have been promising to build grid-scale storage from used EV batteries, but they\u2019ve only materialized in small amounts. Redwood, which got its start as a battery materials and recycling company, is creating a new line that promises to deliver gigawatts of much needed energy storage in just a few years.\n\u201cThis really demonstrates how economical the waste hierarchy actually is,\u201d Jessica Dunn, a battery expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told TechCrunch. That a large recycler like Redwood recognized the profit potential in repurposed EV batteries shows \u201cwhere this end-of-life market will go,\u201d she added.\nRepurposing batteries is a clear business opportunity for Redwood, but it might also be a business imperative. Redwood was founded to build a supply chain that could handle the predicted wave of used EV batteries that will hit the market. But that wave hasn\u2019t materialized quite as quickly as some predicted.\n\u201cIf Redwood didn\u2019t enter the repurposing market, then they wouldn\u2019t get a share from the repurposed battery. They\u2019d have to wait the five, 10, 15 years until they retired,\u201d she said. In the meantime, other companies would be able to sell the batteries for grid-scale storage, cutting Redwood out of years of revenue.\nStraubel acknowledged this, noting in an interview that in many ways Redwood Materials started a bit early.\n\u201cWe started really early, and in a way we started Redwood almost too early,\u201d he said, noting the company initially was collecting consumer batteries and production scrap ahead of the coming wave of EVs.\nThe current state of the recycling market underscores the challenge. \u201cRight now, the recycling market is mostly manufacturing scrap, consumer electronics, and EV batteries that have failed under warranty,\u201d Dunn said. That has been enough for Redwood to process over 20 gigawatt-hours annually. But it pales in comparison to the 350 gigawatt-hours in EVs today and the 150 gigawatt-hours expected to hit the road every year.\nRedwood currently has a recycling facility at its 175-acre campus in Sparks, Nevada, and it\u2019s developing a 600-acre facility in Charleston, South Carolina. The latter will remanufacture cathode and anode copper foil, both of which contain critical minerals that the U.S. would prefer stayed within its borders.\nThe company previously said that it will be capable of making 100 gigawatt-hours annually of cathode active material and anode foil by the end of this year. By the end of the decade, it expects production to hit 500 gigawatt-hours.\"\n\nResponse:",
