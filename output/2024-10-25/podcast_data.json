Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

With the two days of gains, the stock erased its loss for the year and is now up 8.4% in 2024, still trailing the Nasdaq's 23% increase.\nAnalysts at Piper Sandler were the latest to bolster their price target following Wednesday's earnings report. The firm, which already had a buy rating on the stock, said it was increasing its 12-month stock price prediction to $315 from $310 \"to reflect higher deliveries and higher margins.\"\nTesla shares on Thursday soared 22%, their second-best performance since the company's IPO in 2010. That came after Tesla reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which just missed analysts' expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\nTesla's profit margins were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which JPMorgan Chase analysts noted in a report were a \"potentially unsustainable driver\" of earnings and cash flow. Results were also boosted by $326 million in revenue from FSD, the company's Full Self-Driving Supervised system.\nCEO Elon Musk said on the earnings call that his \"best guess\" is that vehicle growth will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing lower-cost vehicles and the \"advent of autonomy.\" Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\nWhen it comes to autonomy, however, Musk has consistently missed his own deadlines for getting products to market. Bernstein analysts wrote in a note after earnings that Musk has a \"long history of being overly optimistic about FSD,\" adding that research shows \"Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors\" on robotaxis.\nMusk also said on the call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He said Tesla would conduct driverless ride-hailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\nWith the two-day rally, Musk has now increased his paper wealth by roughly $30 billion, bringing his total net worth to about $274 billion, according to Forbes. That puts him more than $60 billion ahead of the world's second-richest person, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who is a former Tesla board member and a good friend of Musk's.\nStill, Tesla's stock remains 34% below its all-time high reached in 2021. The company had a brutal first quarter of 2024, with year-over-year deliveries falling and consumers flocking to EVs from a host of competitors.\nThe competitive risks remain.\nIn China, companies such as BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers such as Li Auto and Nio, have been ramping up sales. In the U.S., legacy automakers Ford and General Motors are starting to sell more electric vehicles, despite walking back prior electrification commitments.\nWATCH: Tesla's price war is over\n\ntitle1:\nAlphabet's self-driving unit Waymo closes $5.6 billion funding round\ndescription1:\nWaymo has closed a $5.6 billion funding round to expand its robotaxi service in and beyond Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix, where it operates today.\nThe autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.\nIn a statement to CNBC, Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov said the funding would go toward expansion and advancing the Waymo Driver for business applications.\n\"With this latest investment, we will continue to welcome more riders into our Waymo One ride-hailing service in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, and in Austin and Atlanta through our expanded partnership with Uber,\" they wrote.\nThe series C funding brings Waymo's total capital raised to more than $11 billion after it raised $3.2 billion and $2.5 billion in two earlier rounds. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat announced in July that the parent company would commit to a multiyear investment of up to $5 billion in Waymo.\nWhile many companies are testing autonomous vehicles, or AVs, on public roads in the U.S., including well-funded upstarts such as Wayve, Waymo is the only one to operate a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas.\nThe service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. And it has even been used by parents to send their teens to school when other transit options felt less safe or convenient.\nWaymo now conducts more than 100,000 weekly trips for passengers in Los Angeles, Phoenix and San Francisco, who can hail their robotaxis via the Waymo One app. More recently, Waymo partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas \u2014 home of would-be rival Tesla's headquarters.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has made promises about self-driving cars for more than a decade. This week, he said Tesla would offer a driverless ride-hailing service in Texas and California next year, once the company upgrades the partially automated systems in its existing vehicles, which still require a human driver today.\nGM-owned Cruise had been Waymo's closest competitor in the U.S. until it paused operations following an October 2023 incident in San Francisco in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise AV, after she was first struck by a human driver in another car. Cruise is working to reinstate its service and also plans to partner with Uber.\nSelf-driving vehicle makers in the U.S. must still prove their technology is safer to use than taxis and trucks with human drivers. As CNBC previously reported, nearly two-thirds of U.S. respondents to a Pew Research Center survey said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity.\nWaymo's self-reported data suggests that their vehicles crash \"far less often than human drivers on public roads,\" according to analysis by Understanding AI author Timothy B. Lee.\nStill, Waymo has initiated software recalls to improve the safety of its self-driving systems, and its AVs have sometimes blocked traffic, traveled the wrong way down the street, or been involved in collisions, though none resulted in a known fatality or severe injury.\nThe next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that's equipped with its custom sensors and AI \"Driver.\" Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker's Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.\nIn August, Waymo said it would also test its driverless vehicles in harsher, winter weather including in northern California, upstate New York and Michigan, with the hope of offering robotaxi services beyond the sunbelt, and eventually internationally.\n\ntitle2:\nApple returns to top 5 in China with iPhone 16, Huawei grows faster\ndescription2:\nPeople walk past an advertisement for the iPhone 16 Pro at an Apple store during National Day holiday on October 3, 2024 in Chongqing, China.\nHuawei trailed Apple in third place with 15.3% market share, IDC data showed. However, the company's smartphone shipments in China grew by 42% year-on-year, as it continues to stage a revival in the world's largest smartphone market.\nApple stood at second position by market share in the third quarter, according to International Data Corporation (IDC). The tech giant took a 15.6% slice of the Chinese market over the period, down from 16.1% in the third quarter of last year. The company's shipment growth to China flatlined year-on-year in the third quarter. Apple stood at second position by market share in the third quarter.\nApple rejoined the ranks of the top five smartphone vendors in the China in the third quarter, helped by the launch of the iPhone 16, data released on Friday showed \u2014 but its growth was still outpaced by domestic rival Huawei.\nApple and Huawei have been locked in an intense battle since the Chinese tech giant launched its new Mate 60 smartphone last year that contained a surprisingly advanced chip. Huawei has been battered over the last few years by U.S. sanctions that have restricted its access to advanced semiconductors, along with software. The measures have crippled its smartphone business.\nThe Mate 60 has led to a Huawei revival in its home market, and the company has since launched a number of new devices, including a so-called trifold phone, the Mate XT.\nHuawei's resurgence has put intense pressure on Apple in China, one of its largest and most important markets. In the second quarter, Apple was knocked out of the top five ranking in China by market share.\n\"Huawei has staged an impressive comeback, recording four consecutive quarters of at least double-digit growth. The launch of the world's first tri-foldable phone is expected to further drive the foldable market development,\" IDC said in its report.\nThe Cupertino giant is hoping the iPhone 16 series will help it stage a comeback in China, with the company promising many new AI software features called Apple Intelligence. The company has said that Apple Intelligence will launch in the U.S. this fall, but there is no clear timeline as to when it will be released in China, mainly due to more complicated regulation in the country.\nIn the absence of Apple Intelligence, Chinese rivals including Oppo, Huawei and Honor have been touting their own AI features.\nApple CEO Tim Cook visited China this week, meeting with top government officials and executives at the country's tech companies. One analyst told CNBC this may be an attempt to shore up partnerships with Chinese companies to launch Apple Intelligence.\nDomestic rival Vivo stood in first place with 18.6% of the Chinese market share in the third quarter and year-on-year shipment growth of 21.5%, IDC said. Xiaomi and Honor were in fourth and fifth place, respectively.\nSeparate numbers released on Friday by Canalys showed Apple's China shipments in the third quarter declined 6% year-on-year. Canalys said Apple was fifth place by market share in China. Meanwhile, the data company put Huawei in second place by market share, with 24% year-on-year growth in the third quarter of this year.\n\ntitle3:\nMcDonald's broken ice cream machines could get fixed faster thanks to new federal rule\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nMcDonald\u2019s ice cream machines have developed a lousy reputation for being broken when you visit the restaurant, largely due to strict copyright laws that only permit specially licensed technicians to legally repair them. The manufacturers have to license each technician, and they put locks on the McFlurry machines to prevent others from repairing them.\nHowever, 404 Media spotted a new federal ruling on Friday declaring that technicians can legally hack their way around the locks put on McFlurry machines by the manufacturer. This means that more technicians will be able to repair McDonald\u2019s ice cream machines and is widely seen as a win for the right to repair community.\niFixit, which posts how-to\u2019s for the tech repair community, posted a breakdown of McFlurry machines last year, showing how to circumvent these locks with a simple device, which McDonald\u2019s previously asked franchise owners not to use. Now, franchise owners are free to use them.\n\ntitle4:\nSiri\u2019s big ChatGPT upgrade is here \u2014 for better and worse\ndescription4:\nApple Intelligence\u2019s official launch is less than a week away, but it\u2019s the next wave of AI updates that will start to make Siri a lot more useful.\nThe forthcoming iOS 18.2 update \u2014 now available as a developer beta \u2014 starts to make your phone a lot smarter with the addition of Visual Intelligence and the ability to pass Siri requests along to ChatGPT. On phones that support Apple Intelligence, Siri won\u2019t just be a \u201clet me Google that for you\u201d machine; now it\u2019s a \u201clet me ChatGPT that for you\u201d machine, with all that entails: good, bad, and everything in between.\nBy default, Siri will ask for confirmation every time it wants to pass on a request to ChatGPT. This makes a lot of sense, and I thought I\u2019d prefer that behavior. But after an afternoon using it, I realized I just wanted to get to the ChatGPT answer faster and turned it off. Siri still handles basic questions on its own and doesn\u2019t pass things like \u201cWhen is the US election?\u201d to ChatGPT, thankfully. And it will still just Google something for you when that\u2019s the best way to get to your answer.\nBut more complex stuff goes to ChatGPT, which means Siri can handle a lot more stuff than I\u2019m used to throwing at it. Ask it \u201cWhat are some cocktails I can make with whiskey and lemon juice?\u201d and you\u2019ll get a short list of options with descriptions. Old Siri will basically just show you a Google search snippet.\nSiri in iOS 18.1 without ChatGPT just tells me to make a whiskey sour. Siri with ChatGPT recommends a few options including a Gold Rush, which is the right answer if you ask me.\nAI chatbots like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini regularly get things wrong and make things up. But I\u2019ve started using them more and more as a starting point when I need help with something and I\u2019m basically clueless. I actually downloaded Gemini (by way of Google\u2019s iOS app) to the iPhone 16 I\u2019ve been using because I got tired of opening it in a browser. As long as you don\u2019t blindly trust what the AI tells you, it\u2019s a handy way to get pointed in the right direction.\nApple has put some nice privacy protections around your use of ChatGPT. OpenAI is \u201crequired to process your request solely for the purpose of fulfilling it and does not store your request or any responses it provides,\u201d Apple states. The information won\u2019t be used to train AI models, either. If you sign in to your OpenAI account, your requests are saved in your ChatGPT history and all of OpenAI\u2019s terms apply. But you don\u2019t need an OpenAI account at all if you don\u2019t want or have one. I appreciate that.\nA glorified, iOS-ified Google Lens\niPhone 16 owners will have another way to tap into ChatGPT\u2019s smarts, too: Visual Intelligence, which is also enabled in 18.2. It\u2019s accessed by holding down the camera control button, which pulls up a camera live view. Once you take a photo, you can have ChatGPT analyze it or use Google Image search to find similar results on the web. It is a glorified, iOS-ified Google Lens, and it\u2019s about time iPhones had something like this built in. Siri could previously look up plants and landmarks and the like, but nothing as expansive as this.\nVisual Intelligence is pretty good \u2014 mostly. It was very flattering in its descriptions of various spots around my house, calling my entryway \u201ccozy\u201d and \u201cwell-organized,\u201d and our whiskey collection \u201cimpressive.\u201d It came up with a decent list of cocktails to make based on a picture of my home bar, and it got me started in the right direction on a home repair with a picture of the problem. As long as you treat the answer as a starting point, AI is pretty handy for these kinds of low stakes questions.\nBut all of the familiar pitfalls of AI chatbots are present, which Apple warns you about in every interaction you have with ChatGPT. I asked it to explain the joke in a Garfield comic strip to me, and it completely made up details that weren\u2019t there (though to be fair, the joke it invented was funnier than the actual source material). I asked it about the books on my shelf and it hallucinated some titles that are definitely not on that shelf.\nIt starts off on the right track then veers into hallucination-land. This is totally plausible but not at all what happens in this comic strip!\nI also wish that ChatGPT would let you check its work the way that Gemini does. Google\u2019s AI chatbot supplies obvious links to articles on the topics it references, so you know where to go to read more and double check what the AI is telling you. ChatGPT mentions in small print the number of sources it pulled from to come up with your answer for Siri, and you need to tap to see links to those articles.\nStill, it\u2019s a leap forward in the kinds of things you can expect Siri to do. And it\u2019s one that people won\u2019t see when they download Apple Intelligence; in iOS 18.1, Siri gets a new look with a glowing border, a new text interface, and improved language understanding. But it\u2019s basically the same old Siri.\nThat starts to change in 18.2, and Apple\u2019s AI ambitions are bigger still than \u201cgo ask ChatGPT.\u201d Eventually, Siri will be able to take action for you in apps \u2014 kind of the whole promise of AI on our phones. But those kinds of updates likely won\u2019t arrive until well into 2025.\"\n\nResponse:",
