Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday January 9), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nThe US has a new cybersecurity safety label for smart devices\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nThe White House this week announced a new label for internet-connected devices, the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, intended to help consumers make more-informed decisions about the cybersecurity of products they bring into their homes.\nTo earn the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark, which is being administered by the Federal Communications Commission, companies have to test their products against established cybersecurity criteria from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology via compliance testing by accredited labs.\nEligible products range from baby monitors to smart home security devices.\nThe U.S. Cyber Trust Mark is the result of a nearly two-year public notice and comment period. The FCC unanimously authorized the program and adopted the final rules in late 2024.\n\ntitle1:\nEbay shares soar as Meta allows listings on Facebook Marketplace\ndescription1:\nShares of eBay closed up 9% on Wednesday as Meta said it will allow some listings to show up on Facebook Marketplace, its popular platform connecting consumers for local item pickups and more.\nEBay stock reached its highest level since November 2021.\nThe rollout will begin with a test in Germany, France and the United States, where buyers will be able to view listings directly on Marketplace and complete the rest of their transactions on eBay, Meta said in a release.\nThe partnership could provide a boost to eBay's marketplace business, which has struggled to compete with e-commerce rivals like Amazon , Walmart , Temu and even Facebook's own marketplace platform that lets users buy and sell items.\nEBay has recently embraced niche categories like collectibles and luxury goods to try and keep buyers and sellers returning to its site. CEO Jamie Iannone told CNBC in an October interview that shoppers were coming to the site, known for its used and refurbished goods, as they sought out discounts amid a rocky macroeconomic environment.\nMeta's move is an attempt to appease the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, after the regulator fined the company 797 million euros ($821 million) in November for tying its Marketplace product to the main Facebook app.\n\ntitle2:\nEdtech giant PowerSchool says hackers accessed personal data of students and teachers\ndescription2:\nEducation technology giant PowerSchool has told customers that it experienced a \u201ccybersecurity incident\u201d that allowed hackers to compromise the personal data of students and teachers in K-12 school districts across the United States.\nThe California-based PowerSchool, which was acquired by Bain Capital for $5.6 billion in 2024, is the largest provider of cloud-based education software for K-12 education in the U.S., serving more than 75% of students in North America, according to the company\u2019s website. PowerSchool says its software is used by over 16,000 customers to support more than 50 million students in the United States.\nIn a letter sent to affected customers on Tuesday and published in a local news report, PowerSchool said it identified on December 28 that hackers successfully breached its PowerSource customer support portal, allowing further access to the company\u2019s school information system, PowerSchool SIS, which schools use to manage student records, grades, attendance, and enrollment. The letter said the company\u2019s investigation found the hackers gained access \u201cusing a compromised credential.\u201d\nPowerSchool has not said what types of data were accessed during the incident or how many individuals are affected by the breach.\nPowerSchool spokesperson Beth Keebler confirmed the incident in an email to TechCrunch but declined to answer specific questions about the incident. Bain Capital has responded to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\n\u201cWe have taken all appropriate steps to prevent the data involved from further unauthorized access or misuse,\u201d Keebler said. \u201cThe incident is contained and we do not anticipate the data being shared or made public. PowerSchool is not experiencing, nor expects to experience, any operational disruption and continues to provide services as normal to our customers.\u201d\nThe nature of the cyberattack remains unknown. Bleeping Computer reports that in an FAQ sent to affected users, PowerSchool said it did not experience a ransomware attack, but that the company was extorted into paying a financial sum to prevent the hackers from leaking the stolen data. PowerSchool told the publication that names and addresses were exposed in the breach, but that the information may also include Social Security numbers, medical information, grades, and other personally identifiable information. PowerSchool did not say how much the company paid.\nPowerSchool was sued by class action in November 2024, which alleges the company illegally sells student data without consent for commercial gain. According to the lawsuit, the company\u2019s troves of student data totals some \u201c345 terabytes of data collected from 440 school districts.\u201d\n\u201cPowerSchool collects this highly sensitive information under the guise of educational support, but in fact collects it for its own commercial gain,\u201d while hiding behind \u201copaque terms of service such that no one can understand,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\nUpdated with comment from PowerSchool.\nDo you have more information about the PowerSchool data breach? We\u2019d love to hear from you. From a non-work device, you can contact Carly Page securely on Signal at +44 1536 853968 or via email at carly.page@techcrunch.com.\n\ntitle4:\nApple says Siri isn\u2019t sending your conversations to advertisers\ndescription4:\nApple is refuting rumors that it ever let advertisers target users based on Siri recordings in a statement published Wednesday evening describing how Siri works and what it does with data.\nThe section specifically responding to the rumors reads:\nApple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose. We are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private, and will continue to do so.\nThe conspiracy theory the company is responding to resurfaced last week after Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit over users whose conversations were captured by its Siri voice assistant and potentially overheard by human employees.\nWhile Apple\u2019s settlement addresses an issue that The Guardian reported in 2019. The report showed human contractors tasked with reviewing anonymized recordings and grading whether the trigger was activated intentionally, would sometimes receive recordings of people discussing sensitive information. But it doesn\u2019t include any reference to selling data for marketing purposes.\nAfter The Guardian\u2019s report in 2019, Apple apologized and changed its policy, making the default setting not to retain audio recordings from Siri interactions and saying that for users who opt-in to sharing recordings, those recordings would not be shared with third-party contractors.\nHowever, reports about the settlement noted that in earlier filings like this one from 2021, some of the plaintiffs claimed that after they mentioned brand names like \u201cOlive Garden,\u201d \u201cEaston bats,\u201d \u201cPit Viper sunglasses,\u201d and \u201cAir Jordans,\u201d they were served ads for corresponding products, which they attributed to Siri data.\nApple\u2019s statement tonight says it \u201cdoes not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri, and even then, the recordings are used solely for that purpose. Users can easily opt-out at any time.\u201d\nFacebook responded to similar theories in 2014 and 2016 before Mark Zuckerberg addressed it directly, saying \u201cno\u201d to the question while being grilled by Congress over the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.\nSo, if Apple (and Facebook, Google, etc.) is telling the truth, then why would you see an ad later for something you only talked about?\nThere are other explanations, and attempts to check the rumors out include an investigation in 2018 that didn\u2019t find evidence of microphone spying but did discover that some apps secretly recorded on-screen user activity that they shipped to third parties.\"\n\nResponse:",
