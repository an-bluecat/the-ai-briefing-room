Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

There was the time Google said its latest quantum chip indicated multiple universes exist. Or when Anthropic gave its AI agent Claudius a snack vending machine to run and it went amok, calling security on people and insisting it was human.\nThis week, it was OpenAI\u2019s turn to raise our collective eyebrows.\nOpenAI released on Monday some research that explained how it\u2019s stopping AI models from \u201cscheming.\u201d It\u2019s a practice in which an \u201cAI behaves one way on the surface while hiding its true goals,\u201d OpenAI defined in its tweet about the research.\nIn the paper, conducted with Apollo Research, researchers went a bit further, likening AI scheming to a human stock broker breaking the law to make as much money as possible. The researchers, however, argued that most AI \u201cscheming\u201d wasn\u2019t that harmful. \u201cThe most common failures involve simple forms of deception \u2014 for instance, pretending to have completed a task without actually doing so,\u201d they wrote.\nThe paper was mostly published to show that \u201cdeliberative alignment\u2060\u201d \u2014 the anti-scheming technique they were testing \u2014 worked well.\nBut it also explained that AI developers haven\u2019t figured out a way to train their models not to scheme. That\u2019s because such training could actually teach the model how to scheme even better to avoid being detected.\n\u201cA major failure mode of attempting to \u2018train out\u2019 scheming is simply teaching the model to scheme more carefully and covertly,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nPerhaps the most astonishing part is that, if a model understands that it\u2019s being tested, it can pretend it\u2019s not scheming just to pass the test, even if it is still scheming. \u201cModels often become more aware that they are being evaluated. This situational awareness can itself reduce scheming, independent of genuine alignment,\u201d the researchers wrote.\nIt\u2019s not news that AI models will lie. By now most of us have experienced AI hallucinations, or the model confidently giving an answer to a prompt that simply isn\u2019t true. But hallucinations are basically presenting guesswork with confidence, as OpenAI research released earlier this month documented.\nScheming is something else. It\u2019s deliberate.\nEven this revelation \u2014 that a model will deliberately mislead humans \u2014 isn\u2019t new. Apollo Research first published a paper in December documenting how five models schemed when they were given instructions to achieve a goal \u201cat all costs.\u201d\nThe news here is actually good news: The researchers saw significant reductions in scheming by using \u201cdeliberative alignment\u2060.\u201d That technique involves teaching the model an \u201canti-scheming specification\u201d and then making the model go review it before acting. It\u2019s a bit like making little kids repeat the rules before allowing them to play.\nOpenAI researchers insist that the lying they\u2019ve caught with their own models, or even with ChatGPT, isn\u2019t that serious. As OpenAI\u2019s co-founder Wojciech Zaremba told TechCrunch\u2019s Maxwell Zeff about this research: \u201cThis work has been done in the simulated environments, and we think it represents future use cases. However, today, we haven\u2019t seen this kind of consequential scheming in our production traffic. Nonetheless, it is well known that there are forms of deception in ChatGPT. You might ask it to implement some website, and it might tell you, \u2018Yes, I did a great job.\u2019 And that\u2019s just the lie. There are some petty forms of deception that we still need to address.\u201d\nThe fact that AI models from multiple players intentionally deceive humans is, perhaps, understandable. They were built by humans, to mimic humans, and (synthetic data aside) for the most part trained on data produced by humans.\nIt\u2019s also bonkers.\nWhile we\u2019ve all experienced the frustration of poorly performing technology (thinking of you, home printers of yesteryear), when was the last time your not-AI software deliberately lied to you? Has your inbox ever fabricated emails on its own? Has your CMS logged new prospects that didn\u2019t exist to pad its numbers? Has your fintech app made up its own bank transactions?\nIt\u2019s worth pondering this as the corporate world barrels toward an AI future where companies believe agents can be treated like independent employees. The researchers of this paper have the same warning.\n\u201cAs AIs are assigned more complex tasks with real-world consequences and begin pursuing more ambiguous, long-term goals, we expect that the potential for harmful scheming will grow \u2014 so our safeguards and our ability to rigorously test must grow correspondingly,\u201d they wrote.\n\ntitle2:\nHow AI startups are fueling Google's booming cloud business\ndescription2:\nGoogle Cloud announced Thursday it has added fast-rising AI coding startups Lovable and Windsurf to its roster of customers. Both companies have chosen Google Cloud as their primary cloud computing provider, the latest sign of Google\u2019s rising prominence against larger rivals AWS and Microsoft Azure.\nThe deals also highlight Google\u2019s efforts to make its cloud business more central to the company\u2019s future.\nToday, Google Cloud is overshadowed by larger competitors like AWS and Microsoft, as well as Google\u2019s much larger advertising business. But it is seeing upward momentum.\nGoogle Cloud is one of the company\u2019s fastest-growing business lines. On its last earnings call, Google said its cloud division hit an annual run rate of $50 billion, and cloud chief Thomas Kurian said this week the unit lined up $58 billion in new revenue over the next two years. Google generated $43.2 billion in cloud services in 2024 and $33.1 billion in 2023.\nWinning contracts with leading AI startups seems to be a large driver of Google Cloud\u2019s growth. The division says it now works with nine out of the 10 leading AI labs, including Safe Superintelligence and OpenAI, and 60% of the world\u2019s generative AI startups. In the last year, the company says it\u2019s seen a 20% increase in the number of new AI startups choosing Google Cloud.\nWhile Lovable and Windsurf, which was recently acquired by Cognition, spend relatively little compared to leading AI labs or large enterprises, the bet is that they will become larger businesses in the future, and well worth the investment.\nGoogle says the two vibe-coding startups use Gemini 2.5 Pro to power their products, which are also run on Google Cloud infrastructure. Google says Windsurf is also using Gemini models in integrations with Cognition\u2019s AI agent, Devin.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe significant cloud costs of training, fine-tuning, and running AI models has presented a major challenge for AI model developers, including Google DeepMind with its Gemini models. But it\u2019s been a boon for cloud businesses. The global cloud market is expected to exceed $400 billion in 2025 and grow at a rate of 20% over the next five years, according to the market intelligence and analytics firm Synergy Research.\nThe company on Thursday hosted its first Google AI Builder\u2019s Forum, in which it brought together hundreds of AI startup founders and announced more than 40 new AI startups building on Google Cloud. In addition to Lovable and Windsurf, Sequoia-backed Factory AI and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Krea AI were among the customers named.\nPart of the reason so many AI startups work with Google Cloud are the generous deals it offers. Many of the AI startups Google works with started on its Google for Startups Cloud Program, in which it offers $350,000 in cloud credits. Google Cloud also offers a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs for startups in the Y Combinator accelerator program.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle now lets you share your custom Gemini AI assistants known as Gems\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nGoogle is making it possible to now share your Gemini Gems \u2014 custom AI assistants and experts designed for specific tasks \u2014 the company announced on Thursday. The feature launched last year, initially as part of the Gemini Advanced paid subscription, allowing users to write instructions to create an AI chatbot for different scenarios. For instance, Google launched with premade Gems like a learning coach, a brainstorming assistant, a career guide, a writing editor, and a coding partner.\nNow Google says you\u2019ll be able to share your Gems with friends, family, or co-workers as easily as you can share a file from Google Drive.\nThis would make Gems more accessible to more people, as not everyone uses the advanced customization feature. It could also help prevent people from building the same Gems as others. For instance, if multiple co-workers were using a similar type of custom Gemini assistant, they could just share the same resource instead of each making their own version that could have slight inconsistencies between them.\nGoogle suggests Gem sharing could also be useful for people working on family vacation plans and guides, meal planners, or collaborative writing projects.\nGoogle GEms. Image Credits:Google (screenshot)\nTo share a Gem, you\u2019ll open the Gem manager on the web app and click the \u201cShare\u201d icon next to any Gem you\u2019ve created. Also similar to Google Drive, you can control who can view and use your Gems and who\u2019s allowed to edit them.\nAfter first rolling out to Gemini Advanced, Gemini Business, and Gemini Enterprise subscribers in over 150 countries, Google announced in March that Gems were now available to everyone and could support file uploads.\n\ntitle4:\nNotion launches agents for data analysis and task automation\ndescription4:\nAt the \u201cMake with Notion\u201d event on Thursday, the company announced the launch of its first AI agent. The agent will draw on all of a user\u2019s notion pages and database as context, automatically generating notes and analysis for meetings, competitor evaluation reports, and feedback landing pages.\nThe productivity platform said that the agent can create pages and databases, or update them with new data, properties, or views. Users can also trigger Notion agents from outside platforms that are linked to the service. For instance, you can ask the Notion agent to create a bug-tracking dashboard from various sources, including Slack, email, and Google Drive.\nImage Credits:Notion\nThe newly announced Agent builds on Notion AI, a pre-existing feature that could search or summarize content. But the new agent is able to tackle more complex multistep tasks, using the powers of agentic AI. The company said that the current version of the agent can perform a task that runs up to 20 minutes across hundreds of pages.\nUsers can set up a \u201cprofile\u201d page for the agent to instruct it to follow directions on referencing sources, style of output, and where to update tasks and final results. You\u2019ll also be able to ask the agent to \u201cremember\u201d key points as people use them. Those memories will be stored on the profile page, and users can edit them there.\nImage Credits:Notion\nIn demo videos, the company gave examples of agents that could provide feedback for landing pages and update them, create a restaurant tracker, create an analysis from meeting notes, and prepare a competition analysis report.\nAt the moment, you have to trigger these actions manually. But Notion said that the ability to create customized agents that work on a schedule or triggers is coming soon. The company will also release a template library for agents so you can pick ready-made prompts that might suit your task.\nOver the last two years, Notion has released a calendar app, a Gmail client, a meeting note-taker, and an enterprise search to get information from different sources. These are features that gave the company enough contextual building blocks to create automations. Other enterprise knowledge and productivity platforms, including Salesforce, Fireflies, and Read AI have launched their own agents to extract and update information.\"\n\nResponse:",
