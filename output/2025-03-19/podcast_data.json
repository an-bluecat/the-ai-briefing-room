Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

According to SoftBank\u2019s statement, Carlyle holds a 59.65% stake while Oracle holds 32.27%. The startup employs 1,000 semiconductor engineers.\nIn 2021, SoftBank considered acquiring a minority stake in Ampere, which was then valued at $8 billion, per Bloomberg.\nSoftBank is the largest shareholder of Arm Holdings, and Ampere has developed a server chip based on the ARM compute platform, positioning the two companies are strong partners. (Softbank acquired a British chip designer Arm for $32 billion in 2016, and it became publicly traded in 2023.) Ampere\u2019s customers include Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, Alibaba, and Tencent, as well as companies like HPE and Supermicro.\nSoftBank stated the Ampere acquisition will bolster its capabilities in key areas like AI and compute and expedite its growth initiatives. The most recent acquisition announcement follows a string of deals made by the Japanese tech mogul over the past few months, including its partnership with OpenAI to develop Advanced Enterprise AI called \u201cCristal intelligence.\u201d SoftBank has also invested in the AI infrastructure project Stargate, which is building data centers for OpenAI across the U.S., and purchased an old Sharp factory in Japan.\n\u201cThe future of Artificial Super Intelligence requires breakthrough computing power,\u201d said Masayoshi Son, Chairman and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. \u201cAmpere\u2019s expertise in semiconductors and high-performance computing will help accelerate this vision and deepens our commitment to AI innovation in the United States.\u201d\nAmpere was founded in 2017 by James, who previously worked at Intel and private equity firm Carlyle and served on the board of Oracle. The company initially specialized in cloud-native computing but has since expanded its scope to include sustainable AI compute.\n\u201cWith a shared vision for advancing AI, we are excited to join SoftBank Group and partner with its portfolio of leading technology companies,\u201d said James. \u201cThis is a fantastic outcome for our team, and we are excited to drive forward our AmpereOne roadmap for high-performance Arm processors and AI.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI's o1-pro is the company's most expensive AI model yet\ndescription1:\nOpenAI has launched a more powerful version of its o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model, o1-pro, in its developer API.\nAccording to OpenAI, o1-pro uses more computing than o1 to provide \u201cconsistently better responses.\u201d Currently, it\u2019s only available to select developers \u2014 those who\u2019ve spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services \u2014 and it\u2019s pricey. Very pricey.\nOpenAI is charging $150 per million tokens (~750,000 words) fed into the model and $600 per million tokens generated by the model. That\u2019s twice the price of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for input and 10x the price of regular o1.\nOpenAI is betting that o1-pro\u2019s improved performance will convince developers to pay those princely sums.\n\u201cO1-pro in the API is a version of o1 that uses more computing to think harder and provide even better answers to the hardest problems,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cAfter getting many requests from our developer community, we\u2019re excited to bring it to the API to offer even more reliable responses.\u201d\nYet early impressions of o1-pro, which has been available in OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT for ChatGPT Pro subscribers since December, weren\u2019t incredibly positive. The model struggled with Sudoku puzzles, users found, and was tripped up by simple optical illusion jokes.\nFurthermore, certain OpenAI internal benchmarks from late last year showed that o1-pro performed only slightly better than the standard o1 on coding and math problems. It did answer those problems more reliably, however, the benchmarks found.\n\ntitle2:\nElon Musk's X reportedly bounces back to $44B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nSocial media site X\u2019s valuation has bounced back to $44 billion, according to a new report from the Financial Times. Elon Musk purchased the platform, formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion back in 2022.\nHowever, a report from Bloomberg states that X has raised close to $1 billion from investors in a deal that values the company at around $32 billion. Musk participated in the equity raise himself, the report says.\nDespite the two differing valuations, it\u2019s apparent that X has taken a sharp turnaround in terms of its finances, given that Fidelity Investments estimated last September that X\u2019s valuation was below $10 billion.\nThe platform\u2019s revenue dropped since Musk\u2019s takeover, but X posted $1.2 billion in adjusted earnings (before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) for 2024, which is about the same as the amount before Musk took over, the Financial Times reports.\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia reportedly acquires synthetic data startup Gretel\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nNvidia has reportedly acquired Gretel, a San Diego-based startup that\u2019s developed a platform to generate synthetic AI training data. Terms of the acquisition are unknown. The price tag was said to be nine figures, exceeding Gretel\u2019s most recent valuation of $320 million, according to Wired.\nGretel and its team of roughly 80 employees will be folded into Nvidia, where its tech will be deployed as part of the former\u2019s suit of generative AI services for developers, Wired reported.\nGretel was founded in 2019 by Alex Watson, Laszlo Bock, John Myers, and Ali Golshan, who also serves as the company\u2019s CEO. The startup fine-tunes models, adds proprietary tech on top, and then packages these models together to sell them.\nGretel raised more than $67 million in venture capital from investors including Anthos Capital, Greylock, and Moonshots Capital prior to its exit, according to Crunchbase.\nNvidia\u2019s acquisition is strategic \u2014 and timely. Tech giants like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic are already using synthetic data to train flagship AI models as they exhaust sources of real-world data.\n\ntitle4:\nClearGrid, armed with a fresh $10M, is developing AI to improve debt collection in MENA\ndescription4:\nDebt collection in emerging markets often feels outdated and can be costly \u2014 damaging borrower trust. As consumer lending surges and regulators push for fairer practices, legacy collection outfits are struggling to maintain pace.\nClearGrid aims to help modernize debt collection \u2014 and recovery \u2014 with AI. The Dubai-based startup, which is emerging from stealth with $10 million in funding ($3.5 million pre-seed and $6.5 million seed), helps banks, fintechs, and lenders recover more debt without resorting to customer harassment.\nFor a startup founded just in May 2023, the backing is significant. Co-founder and CEO Mohammed Al Zaben called it a crucial advantage for a \u201cvery ambitious company with a big mission in a very big market.\u201d\nBuilding AI-driven debt collection\nAl Zaben stumbled into the debt collection space after selling his previous startup, Munch:On, to Careem in 2022. While taking time off following the exit, Al Zaben says he reflected on one of Munch:On\u2019s biggest challenges: collecting payments from corporate customers.\nThat led Al Zaben down a rabbit hole into receivables management and unpaid invoices. Upon further reflection, Al Zaben realized consumer collections posed an even bigger problem.\n\u201cWhen we spoke with collectors, it was clear the industry was stuck in the past \u2014 some agencies still used pen and paper, and the most advanced relied on basic CRMs,\u201d Al Zaben told TechCrunch. \u201cDebt collection was a people-driven business where collectors relied on scare tactics and harassment. Borrowers had a terrible experience, and Saudi and UAE regulators were beginning to prioritize consumer protection.\u201d\nSimultaneously, consumer lending was booming. Buy now, pay later (BNPL) unicorns like Tabby and Tamara were handling billions in sales, and unsecured lending totals were skyrocketing in the Middle East.\nAl Zaben and his co-founders, Khalid Bin Bader Al Saud and Mohammed Khalili, sensed an opportunity. Despite having no experience in the collections market, they launched ClearGrid, creating software and AI to streamline recovery and collaborate with the existing vendors in the space.\n\u201cAt a time when lending is booming, regulations are tightening, and AI is reshaping industries, we see this as an opportunity to help lenders recover debt while building trust with borrowers.\u201d the CEO said.\n\u201cThis is just the first step in building the infrastructure for the future of debt resolution,\u201d Bader Al Saud added.\nAutomated collection components\nClearGrid sits between lenders and borrowers, using AI to automate the collections process. Lenders integrate via ClearGrid\u2019s platform or API, sending borrower accounts for processing.\nClearGrid says its AI models score things like repayment likelihood, help predict customer behavior, and personalize outreach across communication channels.\nAccording to Al Zaben, 95% of ClearGrid\u2019s operations are fully automated, including AI voice agents that handle hundreds of thousands of calls daily. For borrowers preferring human interaction, the platform facilitates direct conversations and feeds the insights into the startup\u2019s many models.\nThe ClearGrid team Image Credits:ClearGrid\nClearGrid\u2019s platform categorizes borrowers based on their ability and willingness to pay, then structures repayments into smaller, manageable chunks, nudging them toward repayment without coercion. The company claims its platform can cut collection costs by 50%.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building purpose-built tools and finding ways to make lenders better at what they do while also creating an opportunity for consumers to get out of debt,\u201d said Al Zaben.\nSince launching in 2024, ClearGrid says it has managed hundreds of millions in debt portfolios and signed ten of the major fintechs and banks in the UAE. An unnamed major bank increased recovery rates by 30% and cut collection costs in half, ClearGrid claims, while a leading BNPL provider doubled recoveries by automating early-stage debt resolution.\nAcross the board, Al Zaben says ClearGrid resolves debts twice as fast as traditional collection agencies, achieving between 38% to 50% resolution rates, while borrowers interact with the platform 60% more than they do with these agencies.\nClearGrid makes money by charging a percentage fee on recovered amounts. The startup\u2019s revenues are growing 30% month-on-month in the UAE, where ClearGrid is already profitable, and the company is looking to enter Saudi Arabia this year, per Al Zaben.\nAl Zaben said with the funding raised, ClearGrid aims to \u201c10x\u201d revenue and accounts managed in 2024 (it engages with over 130,000 borrower accounts monthly.) The company also plans to double its engineering team in the next fiscal quarter to build what Al Zaben calls the \u201cdefinitive credit orchestration infrastructure for the region.\u201d\nClearGrid\u2019s investors include Middle East and North Africa-focused VCs Beco Capital, Nuwa Capital, and Raed Ventures and prominent angel investors such as Anu Hariharan (ex-YC, Avra founder), Amjad Masad (Replit CEO), Jason Gardner (Marqeta CEO), Justin Kan (Twitch co-founder), and Kenneth Lin (ex-CEO at Credit Karma).\"\n\nResponse:",
