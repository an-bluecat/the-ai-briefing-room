Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Gavin Newsom has signed SB 53, a first-in-the-nation bill that sets new transparency requirements on large AI companies.\nSB 53, which passed the state legislature two weeks ago, requires large AI labs \u2014 including OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind \u2014 to be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.\nIn addition, SB 53 creates a mechanism for AI companies and the public to report potential critical safety incidents to California\u2019s Office of Emergency Services. Companies also have to report incidents related to crimes committed without human oversight, such as cyberattacks, and deceptive behavior by a model that isn\u2019t required under the EU AI Act.\nThe bill has received mixed reactions from the AI industry. Tech firms have broadly argued that state-level AI policy risks creating a \u201cpatchwork of regulation\u201d that would hinder innovation, although Anthropic endorsed the bill. Meta and OpenAI lobbied against it. OpenAI even wrote and published an open letter to Gov. Newsom that discouraged his signing of SB 53.\nThe new bill comes as some of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite have poured hundreds of millions into super PACs to back candidates that support a light-touch approach to AI regulation. Leaders at OpenAI and Meta have in recent weeks launched pro-AI super PACs that aim to back candidates and bills that are friendly to AI.\nStill, other states might look to California for inspiration as they attempt to curb the potential harms caused by the unmitigated advancement of such a powerful emerging technology. In New York, a similar bill was passed by state lawmakers and is awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s signature or veto.\n\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cThis legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it \u2014 but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe governor is also weighing another bill \u2014 SB 243 \u2014 that passed both the State Assembly and Senate with bipartisan support this month. The bill would regulate AI companion chatbots, requiring operators to implement safety protocols, and hold them legally accountable if their bots fail to meet those standards.\nSB 53 is Senator Scott Wiener\u2019s second attempt at an AI safety bill after Newsom vetoed his more sweeping SB 1047 last year amid major pushback from AI companies. With this bill, Wiener reached out to major AI companies to attempt to help them understand the changes he made to the bill.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI takes on Google, Amazon with new agentic shopping system\ndescription1:\nChatGPT users in the U.S. can now make Etsy and Shopify purchases within conversations, marking a next step toward the future of online shopping \u2014 both for consumers and the platforms that control product discovery, recommendation, and payments. In other words, OpenAI might be on the path to reshaping who holds power in e-commerce.\nOpenAI\u2019s new \u201cInstant Checkout\u201d feature is available to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Free logged-in users buying from U.S.-based Etsy sellers, with more than 1 million Shopify merchants like Glossier, Skims, Spanx, and Vuori \u201ccoming soon,\u201d per OpenAI.\nInstant Checkout builds on previous shopping features on ChatGPT that surfaced relevant products, images, reviews, prices, and direct links to merchants in response to shopping questions like \u201cwhat should I get my friend who loves ceramics?\u201d or \u201cbest sneakers to wear to the office.\u201d Now, instead of having to leave the conversation, users can just tap \u201cBuy\u201d to confirm their order, shipping, and payment details (options include Apple Pay, Google Pay, Stripe, or credit card) to complete the purchase.\nLast year, Perplexity introduced a similar in-chat shopping and payments feature. Microsoft also offers merchants the ability to create in-chat storefront capabilities with the Copilot Merchant Program.\nThis type of frictionless experience has the potential to spark a new movement in how people shop online \u2014 one that moves away from search engines like Google and e-commerce platforms like Amazon toward conversational agents with curated recommendations, comparisons, and easy checkout experiences.\nIt\u2019s also setting the stage for new power brokers to emerge in e-commerce. Google and Amazon have long been the gatekeepers for retail discovery. If more purchases start inside AI chatbots, the firms behind them will suddenly have more control over what products are surfaced and what commissions or fees they charge.\nBoth Amazon and Google have previously leveraged their dominance to favor their own products or preferred partners, pushing down competitors in search results or charging steep fees to sellers simply to maintain visibility. OpenAI said in a blog post that the product results it surfaces are \u201corganic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user,\u201d and that it will charge merchants a \u201csmall fee\u201d for completed purchases.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for more information.\nAlong with OpenAI\u2019s introduction of in-chat checkout, the AI firm also noted that it will open source its Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), the tech that powers Instant Checkout built with Stripe, so that other merchants and developers can integrate agentic checkout.\n\u201cStripe is building the economic infrastructure for AI,\u201d Will Gaybrick, president of technology and business at Stripe, said in a statement. \u201cThat means re-architecting today\u2019s commerce systems and creating new AI-powered experiences for billions of people.\u201d\nWhile some may balk at handing ChatGPT private payment information, the company says orders, payments, and fulfillment are handled by the merchant using their existing systems. ChatGPT merely acts as an agent, an intermediary that can securely pass along information between user and merchant.\nOpen sourcing ACP makes it easier for merchants to integrate with ChatGPT, widening the adoption of AI chatbots that function as a virtual storefront. It also expands OpenAI\u2019s potential control as a gatekeeper for retail discovery and checkout, and could position the firm to be the de facto architect of the AI commerce ecosystem.\nThat would put it in tension with Google yet again, as the tech giant has recently launched its own open protocol for purchases initiated by AI agents, dubbed Agent Payments Protocol (AP2).\n\ntitle2:\nFrank founder Charlie Javice sentenced to 7 years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nCharlie Javice, founder of the financial aid startup Frank and Forbes 30 under 30 alumnus, has been sentenced to seven years in prison for fraud.\nThe fintech startup had been acquired by JPMorgan Chase in 2021 for $175 million. The bank later accused Javice of lying about its customer base; the founder claimed the company had 4 million customers, when it actually had 300,000. Evidently, JPMorgan Chase did not do its due diligence before agreeing to buy Frank.\nDuring the trial, former Frank engineer Patrick Vovor testified that Javice had asked him to create fake user data prior to the sale; when he declined, Javice asked math professor and data scientist Adam Kapelner for help creating synthetic data. Kapelner provided key testimony for the prosecution.\nAlong with her co-defendant, Frank\u2019s chief growth officer Olivier Amar, Javice will be responsible for paying $278.5 million in restitution.\n\ntitle3:\nAI recruiter Alex raises $17M to automate initial job interviews\ndescription3:\nJob seekers in all fields can expect to soon be doing a lot more initial screening interviews. While that may sound like positive news, it doesn\u2019t mean that there will suddenly be more open positions.\nInstead, recruiters, often bogged down with determining which applicants are qualified for the next round, will outsource the routine screening tasks \u2014 like checking backgrounds, salary needs, and availability \u2014 to (you guessed it) AI.\nAlex, a startup building an AI recruiter, says it\u2019s already helping companies conduct video interviews and phone screens.\nAaron Wang (pictured center, bottom row), who co-founded Alex about 18 months ago, told TechCrunch that the startup\u2019s voice AI tool can conduct autonomous interviews with applicants soon after they apply for a job. \u201cOur AI recruiter does thousands of interviews a day and helps people get hired at some of the biggest companies in the world,\u201d he said.\nAlthough Wang, who previously worked at Facebook and spent time as a quant for a hedge fund, declined to name customers, he said they include Fortune 100 companies, financial institutions, nationwide restaurant chains, and Big 4 accounting firms.\nInvestors view the rise of AI interviewers as a trend that many companies will inevitably adopt. That conviction led to Alex\u2019s new $17 million Series A round, which was led by Peak XV Partners. The round included participation from Y Combinator and Uncorrelated Ventures, along with several chief human resources officers (CHROs) from unnamed Fortune 500 companies, and others. This Series A follows the company\u2019s $3 million seed funding, which was led by 1984 Ventures last year.\nAlex isn\u2019t alone in offering AI recruiting services to companies. The startup\u2019s competitors include other early-stage companies like HeyMilo, ConverzAI, and Ribbon.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

DeepSeek announced the model with a post on Hugging Face, also posting a linked academic paper on GitHub.\nThe most important feature of the new model is called DeepSeek Sparse Attention, an intricate system described in detail in the diagram below. In essence, the system uses a module called a \u201clightning indexer\u201d to prioritize specific excerpts from the context window. After that, a separate system called a \u201cfine-grained token selection system\u201d chooses specific tokens from within those excerpts to load into the module\u2019s limited attention window. Taken together, they allow the Sparse Attention models to operate over long portions of context with comparatively small server loads.\nScreenshot\nFor long-context operations, the benefits of the system are significant. Preliminary testing by DeepSeek found that the price of a simple API call could be reduced by as much as half in long-context situations. Further testing will be required to build a more robust assessment, but because the model is open-weight and freely available on Hugging Face, it won\u2019t be long before third-party tests can assess the claims made in the paper.\nDeepSeek\u2019s new model is one of a string of recent breakthroughs tackling the problem of inference costs \u2014 essentially, the server costs of operating a pre-trained AI model, as distinct from the cost of training it. In DeepSeek\u2019s case, the researchers were looking for ways to make the fundamental transformer architecture operate more efficiently \u2014 and finding that there are significant improvements to be made.\nBased in China, DeepSeek has been an unusual figure in the AI boom, particularly for those who view AI research as a nationalist struggle between the U.S. and China. The company made waves at the beginning of the year with its R1 model, trained using primarily reinforcement learning at a far lower cost than its American competitors. But the model has not sparked a wholesale revolution in AI training, as some predicted, and the company has receded from the spotlight in the months since.\nThe new \u201csparse attention\u201d approach is unlikely to produce the same uproar as R1 \u2014 but it could still teach U.S. providers some much needed tricks to help keep inference costs low.\"\n\nResponse:",
