    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday October 30), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nReddit is profitable for the first time ever, with nearly 100 million daily users\ndescription0:\nReddit just turned a profit for the first time. As part of its third-quarter earnings results released on Tuesday, the company reported a profit of $29.9 million, along with $348.4 million in revenue \u2014 a 68 percent increase year over year.\nThe company hasn\u2019t been profitable at any point in its nearly 20-year history. Since going public, Reddit lost $575 million during its first quarter on the market, but it decreased that loss to $10 million last quarter, and is now finally in the green.\nReddit also grew to 97.2 million daily users over the past few months, marking a 47 percent increase from the same time last year. That number exceeded 100 million users on some days during the quarter, Reddit says.\nReddit\u2019s advertising revenue grew to $315.1 million, while \u201cother\u201d revenue reached $33.2 million on account of \u201cdata licensing agreements signed earlier this year.\u201d Both Google and OpenAI have cut deals with Reddit to train their AI models on its posts.\nIn a letter to shareholders, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman attributed the recent increase in users to the platform\u2019s AI-powered translation feature. Reddit started letting users translate posts into French last year before expanding it to Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and German. Now Huffman says Reddit plans to expand translation to over 30 countries through 2025.\nRelated Reddit is making sitewide protests basically impossible\n\ntitle1:\nSam Altman\u2019s Reddit stake now worth over $1 billion after earnings pop\ndescription1:\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 9, 2024 in Sun Valley, Idaho.\nSam Altman, the controversial CEO of OpenAI, has a stake in social media company Reddit that's worth over $1 billion as of post-market trading on Tuesday.\nAltman controls roughly 12.2 million shares of Reddit, a company he first invested in over a decade ago. Reddit shares soared about 20% in extended trading after the compny reported better-than-expected quarterly results and issued an optimistic forecast.\nAt Reddit's after-hours share price of $98, Altman's holdings are valued at about $1.2 billion.\nPrior to the surging popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT, which was released to the public in late 2022, Altman was best known as a startup investor and as the former president of Y Combinator. Altman's investment portfolio includes past or present stakes in Airbnb, Uber, Instacart, Stripe and Asana, but one of his top bets was Reddit. Altman was on the social media platform's board until around January 2022, when the company said he had recently stepped down.\nReddit went public in March at $34 a share.\nAltman is among the company's largest shareholders, behind only Cond\u00e9 Nast parent Advance Magazine Publishers, Chinese internet giant Tencent and Fidelity. In 2021, as the tech market was booming, Altman invested a combined $60 million in Reddit over two funding rounds, according to the company's IPO prospectus from earlier this year.\nTop shareholders were forbidden from selling Reddit shares for six months during the \"lockup period,\" which expired in September. There's no indication that Altman has sold any of his stock.\nAltman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nEarlier this month, OpenAI closed its latest funding round at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and tech companies. The company expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September.\nAltman told employees last month that there are no plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company.\nIn March, OpenAI said Altman was rejoining the company's board following the conclusion of an internal investigation by U.S. law firm WilmerHale into the events that led to his sudden ouster (and rapid reinstatement) late last year.\n\u2014 CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report\nWATCH: Cramer revisits the year's biggest IPOs\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI reportedly planning to build its first AI chip in 2026\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI is reportedly working with TSMC and Broadcom to build an in-house AI chip \u2014 and beginning to use AMD chips alongside Nvidia\u2019s to train its AI.\nReuters reports that OpenAI has \u2014 at least for now \u2014 abandoned plans to establish a network of factories for chip manufacturing. Instead, the company will focus on in-house chip design. OpenAI has for months been working with Broadcom to create an AI chip for running models, which could arrive as soon as 2026, reports Reuters.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI plans to use AMD chips through Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud platform for model training. Previously, the company relied almost entirely on Nvidia GPUs for training, but chip shortages and delays \u2014 and the high cost of training \u2014 have spurred OpenAI to explore alternatives, according to Reuters.\n\ntitle3:\nAlphabet shares rise on earnings beats boosted by cloud revenue\ndescription3:\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai speaks with Emily Chang during the APEC CEO Summit at Moscone Center West in San Francisco on Nov. 16, 2023.\nGoogle parent Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings that beat on top and bottom lines with strong revenue growth from the company's cloud unit.\nThe company's shares rose as much as 6% in after-hours trading.\nHere are the results:\nEarnings per share: $2.12 vs. $1.85 expected by LSEG\n$2.12 vs. $1.85 expected by LSEG Revenue: $88.27 billion vs. $86.30 billion expected by LSEG\nHere are other numbers Wall Street was watching:\nYouTube advertising revenue : $8.92 billion vs. $8.89 billion, according to StreetAccount\n: $8.92 billion vs. $8.89 billion, according to StreetAccount Google Cloud revenue: $11.35 billion vs. $10.88 billion, according to StreetAccount\n$11.35 billion vs. $10.88 billion, according to StreetAccount Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.72 billion vs. $13.53 billion, according to StreetAccount\nAlphabet's revenue grew 15% year over year, which is stronger than the same quarter last year.\nThe company reported blowout cloud revenue at $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from the $8.41 billion a year ago. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its artificial intelligence offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai opened his call with investors saying the company's \"full stack\" of AI products is now operating at scale and being used by Google's billions of users and \"creating a virtuous cycle.\"\nThe search company's strong quarter kicks off a big week of earnings for tech's megacap companies. Meta and Microsoft report on Wednesday, followed by Apple and Amazon on Thursday.\nAlphabet's net income increased to $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share, compared to $19.7 billion, or $1.55 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\nGoogle's search business generated $49.4 billion in revenue. That was up 12.3% from a year ago, and the search business remains the largest contributor to revenue growth for the company, said Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi on the call.\n\ntitle4:\nAMD earnings report Q3 2024\ndescription4:\nAdvanced Micro Devices reported third-quarter results Tuesday, with earnings in line with forecasts and revenue that slightly beat expectations.\nHere's how the company did, compared with LSEG estimates for the quarter ending Sept. 28:\nEarnings per share : 92 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expected\n: 92 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expected Revenue: $6.82 billion vs. $6.71 billion expected\nAMD said its important data center business doubled in sales for the second quarter in a row, but overall revenue guidance for the fourth quarter was in line with consensus expectations.\nAMD shares fell 7% on Tuesday in extended trading.\nAMD said it expected about $7.5 billion in sales in the current quarter, in line with consensus expectations of $1.16 in adjusted earnings per share on $7.54 billion in revenue. That would be a 22% year-over-year decline for the December quarter.\nThe chipmaker reported net income of $771 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with $299 million, or 18 cents per share, a year ago. Overall mean absolute deviation, or MAD, revenue was up 18% on an annual basis.\nAMD shares are up about 20% so far in 2024, although rivals such as Nvidia and Broadcom have had much greater gains during the same period, driven by the increasing demand for AI chips. AMD is the second-largest vendor of data center graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are used to train and deploy large generative AI models.\nIn October, AMD announced a new artificial intelligence chip called the MI235X and said it expected the AI GPU market to be worth $500 billion by 2028. The company said on Tuesday that it expected $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, up from a previous forecast of $4.5 billion.\n\"Customer and partner interest for MI325X is high. Production shipments are planned to start this quarter,\" said AMD CEO Lisa Su on a call with analysts.\nAMD's AI chips are reported in its data center segment, which more than doubled on an annual basis to $3.5 billion in total sales. AMD said it was mainly driven by the strong sales of its Instinct-branded GPUs for AI. Overall data center revenue was up 122% year over year. Su said that AMD still sees a lot of demand from cloud providers and other companies to build out AI infrastructure.\nAMD's gross margin expanded to 54%, which the company said was because of higher data center revenue.\nAMD also makes central processing chips for laptops and servers. PC sales are reported in AMD's client segment, which grew 23% during the quarter to $1.9 billion. During the quarter, AMD's chips were included in high-end laptops marketed by Microsoft as \"Copilot+\" machines that can run advanced AI included with Windows.\nAMD also makes chips for gaming consoles and PCs. Its gaming category slumped, with sales sliding 68% year over year, which the company blamed on a decrease in \"semi-custom revenue,\" which includes custom chips for game consoles such as the Sony PlayStation 5.\nThe company's embedded business, which includes less-expensive chips for industry and other applications, fell 25% annually to $927 million in sales.\"\n\nResponse:",
