Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

He has a buy rating on the stock.\nFuture growth will have to come from Blackwell, its next-generation chip that has just started shipping to end-users such as Microsoft , Google and OpenAI. More important than Nvidia's third-quarter results will be what the company says about demand for the Blackwell chip.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang will likely update investors about how that is shaping up on Wednesday, and he will potentially address reports that some of the systems based on Blackwell chips are experiencing overheating issues.\nIn August, Nvidia said it expected about \"several billion\" in Blackwell sales during the January quarter.\n\"Our base case is for NVDA to ship ~100K Blackwell GPUs in 4Q, which we believe is near the low-end of investor expectations,\" Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note last week. He has a strong buy rating on the stock.\nSince Nvidia's last earnings report, the stock is up nearly 19%, capping off a stunning run that has seen the share price rise eightfold since ChatGPT was released in late 2022. Alongside the stock's rise has been a fierce increase in sales and margin, and its forward price to earnings ratio has expanded to just under 50, according to FactSet.\nGrowth is slowing, but that is partially because Nvidia's top line is so much larger than before. Nvidia reported 122% growth in sales in the most-recent quarter. That was lower than the 262% year-over-year growth it reported in the April quarter and the 265% growth in the January quarter.\nAnalysts polled by LSEG are expecting around $33.12 billion in revenue, which would be nearly 83% growth compared to a year ago. The company is also expected to post 75 cents in earnings per share, according to LSEG consensus estimates.\nNvidia's data center business accounted for nearly 88% of sales in the most-recent quarter, taking the focus off the company's legacy computer games business.\nThe company makes the chip for the Nintendo Switch, for example, which the Japanese video game company says is seeing major sales declines as the game console ages. Nvidia's gaming business is expected to grow about 6% to $3.03 billion, according to a FactSet estimate. Its automotive business, making chips for electric cars, is still small, even though analysts expect it to grow 38% to about $360 million in sales.\nBut none of that will matter as long as Nvidia's data center business continues to grow at a rate that is nearly doubling on an annual basis and Huang signals to investors that the party won't end.\n\ntitle1:\nTech funding in Europe stabilizes after years of decline\ndescription1:\nOn Monday, British tech lobby group Startup Coalition warned in a blog post that there was a risk Reeves' tax plans could result in a tech \"brain drain.\". (Photo by Oli Scarff/Getty Images) Oli Scarff | Getty Images\nVenture capital investment in European technology startups is projected to decline for a third straight year, according to VC firm Atomico \u2014 but there are signs that things are finally stabilizing as valuations improve and interest rates fall. Europe's venture-backed startups are expected to secure $45 billion of investment by the end of 2024 \u2014 slightly lower than the $47 billion they raised last year, Atomico said Tuesday in its \"State of European Tech\" report. Still, Atomico said this shows that European tech funding levels have finally \"stabilized\" despite worsening global macroeconomic conditions leading to three consecutive years of declines. The firm stressed that the continent's tech ecosystem is in a much better place than it was a decade ago, with funding this year still set to eclipse the $43 billion startups raised between 2005 and 2014. In the period spanning 2015 to 2024, European startups have bagged $426 billion, dwarfing the sum of investment deployed into tech firms the decade prior.\nTom Wehmeier, head of insights at Atomico, told CNBC that Europe still has a few key areas of improvement to address before it can produce companies of similar scale to the largest tech firms in the U.S. and China. \"There's frustrations about the continued challenges faced when it comes to regulation, bureaucracy, access to capital and this idea of scaling across the fragmented European marketplace,\" Wehmeier said in an interview. For example, pension funds in Europe face barriers to investing in venture capital funds and therefore aren't gaining much exposure to the continent's fast-growing startup ecosystem, Wehmeier said. European pension funds allocate just 0.01% of the $9 trillion worth of assets they manage into venture capital funds based in the continent, according to Atomico's report. The 2024 publication marks the 10th anniversary since Atomico began compiling its annual report, which is produced in partnership with data firm Dealroom.\nEurope's first $1 trillion tech firm?\nAccording to Atomico there are signs that the sector is improving. In the U.K., for example, Finance Minister Rachel Reeves last week laid out plans to consolidate 86 separate local government pension pots into eight \"megafunds\" to boost investment in domestic assets.\nwatch now\nBritish tech advocacy group techUK said the reforms \"should address barriers to greater availability of pension fund capital and encourage a vision that sees more investment into UK tech science start-ups and scale-ups.\" Reforms to pension schemes are either underway or being discussed in several other countries across Europe. \"These changes could result in billions more being made available to European scale-ups \u2014 and that's something that could be the difference between the best and brightest companies scaling from here in Europe, versus being forced to relocate,\" Wehmeier told CNBC. Atomico said it's optimistic about the next decade in European tech. The VC firm, which was established by Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m, is predicting the entire European tech ecosystem combined could be valued at $8 trillion by 2034, up from around $3 trillion currently. Atomico also predicts that Europe will mint its first-ever trillion-dollar tech company in a decade's time. While Europe is home to several so-called \"decacorns\" valued at $10 billion and above, including Arm , Adyen , Spotify and Revolut, it has so far failed to produce a company valued at $1 trillion. That's unlike the United States, where several of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" technology companies are now worth over $1 trillion. They include Google parent company Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Facebook-owner Meta , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla . \"If we can unlock capital at scale, keep the brightest minds in Europe, maintain that focus on solving really hard problems for society and the economy, that's how we go and unlock the first trillion-dollar company,\" Wehmeier said.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta hires Salesforce's CEO of AI, Clara Shih, to lead new business AI group\ndescription2:\nMeta hired Salesforce\u2019s CEO of AI, Clara Shih, to lead a new organization building AI tools for businesses that use Meta\u2019s apps to reach consumers, according to a LinkedIn post from Shih on Tuesday. Meta confirmed the appointment and the new Business AI group in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to share today that I\u2019ve joined Meta to lead a new Business AI group,\u201d said Shih. \u201cOur vision for this new product group is to make cutting-edge AI accessible to every business, empowering all to find success and own their future in the AI era.\u201d\nAnother Salesforce AI executive, Adam Evans, will take over Shih\u2019s role overseeing the company\u2019s AI efforts, TechCrunch has learned. Evans is now the executive vice president and general manager of AI at Salesforce, according to his LinkedIn.\nMeta has an unusual business model around AI, claiming to use an open source approach, though not by everyone\u2019s definition of it. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company doesn\u2019t sell a subscription to its AI chatbots, like OpenAI or Google, in order to generate revenue. Instead, Meta is betting that its Llama large language models will make its current family of apps that much better. These AI tools for businesses seem to be part of that effort.\nSpecifically, Meta\u2019s new group will offer AI products made with Llama to the millions of businesses advertising and creating content on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp. It\u2019s unclear exactly what kind of tools Meta could offer these folks, but offering tools to create AI-generated ads seems likely. Meta has recently pushed more AI-generated content into its social media feeds, including a carousel on Facebook of AI-generated photos, and AI chatbots imitating content creators on Instagram.\nThat\u2019s a notable shift for Meta\u2019s platforms, which previously only featured human-generated content. Giving businesses tools to cheaply generate more ads could be quite lucrative for Meta. It\u2019s unclear if Meta will sell these AI tools, or if they\u2019ll be offered for free as a way to drive up ad spending \u2014 the company\u2019s main source of revenue.\n\u201cWe believe these latest advancements in AI represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers,\u201d said Meta\u2019s VP and Head of Monetization, John Hegeman, in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. \u201cThis new product group under Clara\u2019s leadership will help us bring that vision to life.\u201d\nShih previously led Salesforce\u2019s AI efforts, which have not exactly been a huge success. In May, Salesforce\u2019s shares dropped the most since 2008, largely because investors feared the enterprise giant had missed out on the AI boom. The enterprise giant told investors at the time it expected to have the slowest growth ever in the coming quarter. Since then, Salesforce has leaned hard into AI, releasing an AI agent developer platform called Agentforce. Its CEO, Marc Benioff, has even gone on the offensive, publicly taking shots at Microsoft\u2019s enterprise AI efforts.\nSalesforce did not immediately respond on the record to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nNow it seems Shih will have a chance to start something new at Meta, a company she wrote a book about in 2009 called \u201cThe Facebook Era.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nApple says Mac users targeted in zero-day cyberattacks\ndescription3:\nApple released security updates on Tuesday that it says are \u201crecommended for all users,\u201d after fixing a pair of security bugs used in active cyberattacks targeting Mac users.\nIn a security advisory on its website, Apple said it was aware of two vulnerabilities that \u201cmay have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.\u201d The bugs are considered \u201czero day\u201d vulnerabilities because they were unknown to Apple at the time they were exploited.\nTo fix the bugs, Apple released a software update for macOS, as well as fixes for iPhones and iPads, including users running the older iOS 17 software.\nIt\u2019s not yet known who is behind the attacks targeting Mac users, or how many Mac users have been targeted \u2014 or if any were successfully compromised. The vulnerabilities were reported by security researchers at Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed hacking and cyberattacks, suggesting that a government actor may be involved in the attacks. Government-backed cyberattacks sometimes involve the use of commercial phone spyware.\nAs for the bugs themselves, Apple said the vulnerabilities relate to WebKit and JavaScriptCore, the web engines that power the Safari browser and for running web content. WebKit is a frequent target of malicious hackers, who target the engine for vulnerabilities as a way to break into the device\u2019s wider software and tap into the user\u2019s private data.\nThe security advisory says the bugs can be exploited by tricking vulnerable Apple devices into processing maliciously crafted web content, such as a website or email, to trigger arbitrary code execution, which can allow the planting of malware on a target\u2019s device.\nUsers should update their iPhones, iPads, and Macs as soon as possible.\nApple did not comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Tuesday.\n\ntitle4:\nBitcoin ETF options begin trading, offering a new way to hedge bitcoin exposure\ndescription4:\nOptions on BlackRock's popular iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) began trading on the Nasdaq Tuesday, ushering in a new way to trade and speculate on the price of bitcoin.\nIBIT traded 73,000 options contracts in the first 60 mins of trading Tuesday, Nasdaq told CNBC, placing the fund in the top 20 of the most active nonindex options.\nOptions trading allows investors to play bitcoin's notorious volatility by letting them buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price based on whether they anticipate the price will rise or fall in a given period.\n\"Bitcoin has a lively derivatives market, but in the U.S. it is still tiny compared to other asset classes, and is largely limited to institutional players,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter. \"A deeper onshore derivatives market will enhance the growing market sophistication. This will reinforce investor confidence in the asset, bringing in new cohorts while enabling a greater variety of investment and trading strategies \u2026 [That] should, all else being equal, dampen both volatility and downside.\"\nThe market for options contracts on major ETFs can be extremely active, and are widely used by more sophisticated traders. For example, over the past five business days, Interactive Brokers clients have more options orders on the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the SDPR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) than for the funds themselves, according to data from the brokerage.\nThe launch of the bitcoin ETF options will likely also lead to new funds that incorporate those options, said Todd Sohn, ETF strategist at Strategas.\n\"Grayscale already did a filing for a covered call [fund], and I'm sure BlackRock will come out with it too. And then we're going to get buffers, and then we're going to get whatever other trend-following-type strategy that folks think of. I think the ecosystem's really going to start to fly here,\" Sohn said.\"\n\nResponse:",
