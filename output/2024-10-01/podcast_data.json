Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday October 2), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla set to report Q3 deliveries ahead of robotaxi event\ndescription0:\nTesla Chief Executive, Elon Musk enters the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 6, 2017.\nTesla is set to report third-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers on Wednesday.\nAnalysts are expecting Elon Musk's automaker to report about 463,310 deliveries, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount. That would include about 435,900 of Tesla's Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs.\nTesla reported deliveries of 435,059 and production of 430,488 vehicles for the same period a year ago, before it was selling the Cybertruck. More recently, Tesla reported deliveries of 443,956 and production of 410,831 vehicles for the second quarter of 2024.\nIf Tesla meets analysts' expectations that would represent a 6.5% year-over-year increase for deliveries after declines in the first and second quarters of 2024.\nDeliveries are not defined in Tesla's financial disclosures, but they are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company.\nIn the third quarter, as it did earlier this year, Tesla continued to offer a variety of incentives and financing plans to drive sales volumes, particularly in the largest market for EVs in the world, mainland China.\nTesla hasn't given specific guidance for the full year of deliveries in 2024, but the company has said it expects a lower delivery growth rate this year versus last. Wells Fargo, pointing to this lack of guidance, said in a note that it's expecting 1.63 million full-year deliveries for Tesla and third-quarter deliveries at around 440,000, below consensus.\nGoldman Sachs last week said it expects Tesla deliveries and production \"to come in-line with consensus, largely driven by the strength in the China market.\" Goldman Sachs recommended buying call options ahead of the Wednesday report.\nRobotaxi day in focus\nShares in the EV maker are up more than 20% over the past month, in anticipation that deliveries could improve year over year and sequentially in the third quarter, and ahead of the company's robotaxi day on Oct. 10.\nTesla plans to host investors and fans at its \"We, Robot\" marketing event at a Warner Bros. Discovery movie studio in Los Angeles.\nThe automaker is expected to show off the design of a \"dedicated robotaxi,\" which Musk has referred to previously as the CyberCab. Tesla may also provide updates on its humanoid robotics project \"Optimus\" and other automotive and AI-driven products and services.\nTesla EV sales and revenue fell in the first half of 2024, and the company still has yet to deliver a self-driving system that can function as a robotaxi without a human driver at the wheel ready to steer or brake at any time. Tesla also renamed its premium driver assistance option to Full Self-Driving Supervised, tacking on a disclaimer-style term at the end.\nMeanwhile, several rivals in the autonomous vehicle industry have begun producing robotaxis, and operating commercial robotaxi services. Rivals include Alphabet -owned Waymo in the U.S., and Pony.ai and Baidu in China. Amazon -owned Zoox is preparing a launch of a commercial robotaxi service in the U.S. as well.\nTesla brand erosion\nSome customer interest in buying Tesla vehicles has been chilled by the brand's strong association with Musk.\nThe company's favorability among both liberal and conservative consumers fell in July, according to CivicScience. Tesla favorability dropped with Democrats to 18% in July, down from 39% in January, and it declined among Republicans to 22%, down from 36% in January.\nMusk \u2014 who also leads SpaceX, X and xAI \u2014 has long shared provocative posts on social media, but in recent years, he's become less filtered and more vociferous online about his right-wing political beliefs.\nIn July, he publicly endorsed former President Donald Trump, and he frequently posts screeds on X concerning illegal immigration, election fraud, crime, violence and other flashpoint issues.\nHe has shared political misinformation and deepfakes with his massive online following on X, according to reports by The Associated Press, CNN, NBC News, The New York Times and others. Before Musk acquired Twitter, now known as X, his feed focused more on Tesla and SpaceX, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.\nAmong the posts Musk recently spread on X were false claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's pets. The Springfield Police Division, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and other local groups have all said the claims were baseless.\nIt remains to be seen whether left-leaning customers' view of Musk will weigh on deliveries this year. Pew Research has found that Democrats have a much more favorable view of battery-electric vehicles and are more likely to buy them than Republicans in the U.S.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft AI bet shows up in finance leases that haven't yet commenced\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at a company event on artificial intelligence technologies in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024. Microsoft will invest $1.7 billion to build out cloud computing and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Indonesia, betting on Southeast Asia's biggest economy to spur growth.\nAs Microsoft investors get ready for quarterly earnings this month, there's one particular metric that's become increasingly important: finance leases.\nA finance lease lets a company pay for an asset over years, rather than all upfront. For companies like Microsoft that are building massive data centers to handle artificial intelligence workloads, shareholders have to get used to some big numbers.\nIn July, Microsoft told investors in a footnote of its annual report that finance leases that had not yet begun had soared to $108.4 billion, up $20.6 billion from the quarter before, and nearly $100 billion higher than two years earlier. Leases will commence between the 2025 and 2030 fiscal years, and will run for up to 20 years, the filing said.\nOverall, Microsoft made $19 billion in capital expenditures in the latest quarter. The total, which includes assets acquired under finance leases, was up from $14 billion in the March quarter and was as much as Microsoft shelled out in the entire 2020 fiscal year.\n\"It's an insane ramp,\" said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager who writes about capital expenditures on his blog Platformonomics.\nInvestors will get further clarity on Microsoft's lease finances when the company reports fiscal first-quarter results in late October. Executives at Microsoft and other top tech companies have approved higher capital expenditures in the past two years, often to boost their performance in generative AI.\nLast month Microsoft confirmed its participation in a fund to back the development of data centers and the necessary energy infrastructure, mainly in the U.S. It also signed a 20-year power purchase agreement to restart a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft Copilot can now read your screen, think deeply, and speak aloud to you\ndescription2:\nA week after announcing a wave of updates for its enterprise suite of Copilot AI-powered products, Microsoft is launching new Copilot capabilities on Windows for all users, including a tool that can understand and respond to questions about what\u2019s on your screen.\nRefreshed Copilot apps for iOS, Android, Windows, and the web are rolling out today, and all feature a Copilot with a more \u201cwarm\u201d and \u201cdistinct\u201d style, as Microsoft describes it. Microsoft is also bringing the chatbot to WhatsApp, letting users chat with Copilot via DM, similar to the experience you get with other bots on Meta\u2019s messaging platform.\nCopilot Vision\nCopilot Vision has a view of what you\u2019re viewing on your PC \u2014 more specifically, a lens into the sites you\u2019re visiting with Microsoft Edge. Gated behind Copilot Labs, a new Copilot Pro-exclusive opt-in program for experimental Copilot capabilities, Copilot Vision can analyze text and images on web pages and answer queries (e.g., \u201cWhat\u2019s the recipe for the food in this picture?\u201d) about them.\nVision, which can be pulled up by typing \u201c@copilot\u201d in Edge\u2019s address bar, isn\u2019t exactly a technical marvel. Google offers similar search technology on Android, and recently brought bits and pieces of that tech to Chrome as well.\nBut Microsoft suggests that Copilot Vision is more powerful and conscious of privacy than previous screen-analyzing features.\n\u201cCopilot Vision can \u2026 suggest next steps, answer questions, help navigate whatever it is you want to do, and assist with tasks, all while you simply speak to it in natural language,\u201d Microsoft wrote in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cImagine you\u2019re trying to furnish a new apartment. Copilot Vision can help you search for furniture, find the right color palette, think through your options on everything from rugs to throws, and even suggest ways of arranging what you\u2019re looking at.\u201d\nUsing Copilot Vision to ask questions about a photo on the web. Image Credits: Microsoft\nNo doubt eager to avoid another round of bad press from AI privacy fumbles, Microsoft is stressing that Copilot Vision was designed to delete data immediately following conversations. Processed audio, images, or text aren\u2019t stored or used to train models, the company claims \u2014 at least not in this preview version.\nCopilot Vision is also limited in the types of websites that it can interpret. For the time being, Microsoft\u2019s blocking the feature from working on paywalled and \u201csensitive\u201d content, limiting Vision to a pre-approved list of \u201cpopular\u201d web properties.\nWhat does \u201csensitive\u201d content entail, exactly? Porn? Violence? At this juncture, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t say.\nAccusations of circumventing paywalls with AI tools have landed Microsoft in legal hot water in the recent past. In an ongoing lawsuit, The New York Times alleged that Microsoft allowed users to get around its paywall by serving NY Times articles through the Copilot chatbot on Bing. When prompted in a certain way, Copilot \u2014 which is powered by close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI\u2019s models \u2014 would give verbatim (or close-to-verbatim) snippets of paid stories, according to The Times.\nMicrosoft said that Copilot Vision, which is U.S.-only at the moment, will respect sites\u2019 \u201cmachine-readable controls on AI\u201d \u2014 like rules that disallow bots from scraping data for AI training. But the company hasn\u2019t said precisely which controls Vision will respect; there are several in use. We\u2019ve asked Microsoft for clarification.\nMany major publishers have opted to block AI tools from trawling their websites not only out of fear their data will be used without permission, but also to prevent these tools from sending their server costs soaring. If the current trend holds, Copilot Vision may not work on some of the web\u2019s top news sites.\nMicrosoft said it\u2019s committed to \u201ctaking feedback\u201d to allay concerns.\n\u201cBefore we launch broadly, we\u2019ll continue to \u2026 refine our safety measures and keep privacy and responsibility at the center of everything we do,\u201d Microsoft said in the blog post. \u201cThere is no specific processing of the content of a website you are browsing [with Copilot], nor any AI training \u2014 Copilot Vision simply reads and interprets the images and text it sees on the page for the first time along with you.\u201d\nThink Deeper\nAs with Vision, Copilot\u2019s new Think Deeper feature is an attempt to make Microsoft\u2019s assistant more versatile.\nThink Deeper gives Copilot the ability to reason through more complex problems, Microsoft said, thanks to \u201creasoning models\u201d that take more time before responding with step-by-step answers.\nWhich reasoning models? Microsoft was a bit cagey when I asked, saying only that Think Deeper uses \u201cthe latest models from OpenAI, fine-tuned by Microsoft.\u201d Reading between the lines, it\u2019s a safe bet that they\u2019re a customized version of OpenAI\u2019s o1 model.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve designed Think Deeper to be helpful for all kinds of practical, everyday challenges, like comparing two complex options side by side,\u201d Microsoft wrote in a blog post. \u201cThink Deeper can help with anything from solving tough math problems to weighing up the costs of managing home projects.\u201d\nMicrosoft talked up Think Deeper\u2019s potential quite a bit in its press materials. But assuming the model underneath is o1, it will most certainly fall short in some areas. We\u2019re curious to see what sort of enhancements Microsoft made to the base model and how forthcoming Think Deeper is about its limitations.\nThink Deeper will be available from today to a limited number of Copilot Labs users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.S., and the U.K.\nCopilot Voice\nA new Copilot feature generally available today is Copilot Voice (not to be confused with GitHub\u2019s Copilot Voice). Launching in English in New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the U.K., and the U.S. to start, Voice adds four synthetic voices, letting you talk to Copilot and have its responses be spoken aloud.\nImage Credits: Microsoft\nLike OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, Copilot Voice can pick up on your tone during conversations and respond accordingly, and you can interject at any point while Copilot Voice is answering. A Microsoft spokesperson told me that the mode uses \u201cthe latest voice technology with new models that have been fine-tuned for the Copilot app.\u201d What tech? Which models? On the specifics, mum\u2019s the word.\nOne thing to be aware of: Copilot Voice has a time-based usage limit. Copilot Pro subscribers get more minutes but the number is \u201cvariable,\u201d Microsoft told me, depending on demand.\nPersonalization\nCopilot will soon become more tailored to your likes and preferences, Microsoft said, thanks to a new personalization setting.\nWhen the setting is enabled, Copilot will draw on your past interactions and history, as well as your interactions with other Microsoft apps and services (Microsoft won\u2019t say which) to recommend ways to use Copilot.\n\u201cThis helps you get going,\u201d Microsoft wrote in a blog post, \u201coffering both a handy guide to Copilot\u2019s useful features and conversation starters.\u201d\nPersonalization in Copilot, which can be switched off in the Copilot settings menu on Windows, isn\u2019t slated for the U.K. or EU anytime soon. But users elsewhere should begin to see the setting this afternoon.\nMicrosoft and the EU have had a testy relationship where it concerns the company\u2019s AI product rollouts. In May, the EU warned Microsoft that it could be fined up to 1% of its global annual turnover under the bloc\u2019s online governance regime, the Digital Services Act, after the company failed to respond to a request for information that focused on its generative AI tools.\nA number of tech giants beyond Microsoft, including Apple and Meta, have taken a cautious approach to launching AI tools in the EU, wary of running afoul of the bloc\u2019s laws governing data privacy and model deployment.\n\u201cFor users in the European Economic Area (EEA) and a limited number of other countries, we are evaluating options before offering this level of Copilot personalization for those users,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cSome features will not be available in the EEA until a later date.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAnthropic hires OpenAI co-founder Durk Kingma\ndescription3:\nDurk Kingma, one of the lesser-known co-founders of OpenAI, today announced that he\u2019ll be joining Anthropic.\nIn a series of posts on X, Kingma revealed that he\u2019ll be working mostly remotely, from the Netherlands (where he\u2019s based), but didn\u2019t say which Anthropic org he\u2019ll be joining \u2014 or leading.\nReached for comment, an Anthropic spokesperson pointed to Kingma\u2019s posts.\nI'll be working (mostly) from the Netherlands, but will visit the SF bay area as frequently as I can! \u2014 Durk Kingma (@dpkingma) October 1, 2024\n\u201cAnthropic\u2019s approach to AI development resonates significantly with my own beliefs,\u201d Kingma wrote. \u201c[L]ooking forward to contributing to Anthropic\u2019s mission of developing powerful AI systems responsibly. Can\u2019t wait to work with their talented team, including a number of great ex-colleagues from OpenAI and Google, and tackle the challenges ahead!\u201d\nKingma, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning from the University of Amsterdam, spent several years as a doctoral fellow at Google before joining OpenAI\u2019s founding team as a research scientist. At OpenAI, Kingma focused on basic research, leading the algorithms team to develop techniques and methods primarily for generative AI models, including image generators (e.g. DALL-E 3) and large language models (e.g. ChatGPT).\nIn 2018, Kingma left to become a part-time angel investor and advisor for AI startups.
