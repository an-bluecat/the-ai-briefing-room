Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday December 19), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTikTok agrees to deal to cede control of US business to American investor group\ndescription0:\nTikTok has reached a deal to cede a substantial portion of its U.S. operation to a group of American investors, thus ending a years-long tussle in which the federal government has sought to force the platform to do just that.\nThe new partnership is described as a \u201cnew TikTok U.S. joint venture\u201d in an internal memo from ByteDance CEO Shou Chew, which was viewed by TechCrunch.\nThat arrangement will see major American investors take over significant control of the U.S.-based business. The newly formed investor group includes cloud giant Oracle, the tech-focused private equity firm Silverlake, and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm focused on AI. Together, those companies will own 45% of the U.S. operation, while ByteDance retains a nearly 20% share, the memo states. The new entity formed by this partnership has been dubbed \u201cTikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC.\u201d\nThat new entity will be responsible for overseeing the app, including data protection, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurance, the memo states. \u201cA trusted security partner will be responsible for auditing and validating compliance with the agreed upon National Security Terms, and Oracle will be the trusted security partner upon completion of the transaction,\u201d the document says.\nThe closing date for the deal is listed as January 22, 2026. The news was originally reported by Axios.\nMuch of the deal, as it has been described in the memo, parallels the language in an executive order signed by President Trump in September. That memo similarly approved the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to an American investor group. CNBC previously reported that Oracle, Silverlake, and MGX would be the primary investors in the deal. Until now, ByteDance had not divulged details of such a deal, except to say that it would abide by U.S. law to ensure that TikTok remained available to U.S. users.\nThe U.S. government has long sought to cleave TikTok\u2019s U.S.-based business away from its Chinese parent company, espousing national security concerns as the rationale.\n\ntitle1:\nChatGPT launches an app store, lets developers know it's open for business\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nApp developers looking to launch their programs in ChatGPT can now submit them for review and potential publication, OpenAI said Wednesday. The company also introduced a new app directory within Chat\u2019s tools menu that has swiftly been dubbed an \u201capp store.\u201d\nIn October, the company announced the arrival of apps in its chatbot, explaining that the move would bring a broader suite of capabilities to ChatGPT users. Major platforms \u2014 including Expedia, Spotify, Zillow, and Canva \u2014 announced integrations that would allow users to access their services directly from Chat conversations. Now, the company is opening up the field to a broader array of players.\n\u201cApps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment,\u201d the company said Wednesday.\nOpenAI\u2019s Apps SDK, which is still in beta, currently provides a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users. Once developers are ready, they can submit their apps to the company\u2019s OpenAI Developer platform, where they will be able to track its approval status, the company said. A number of approved apps will start launching within Chat in the coming year, it added.\nThis is a big step for OpenAI toward expanding the app ecosystem within Chat and, at the same time, giving users more reasons to use the app and stay on it.\n\ntitle2:\nInstacart to pay $60M to settle FTC claims it deceived consumers\ndescription2:\nInstacart will pay $60 million in refunds to settle allegations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that it deceived consumers with false advertising. The federal agency alleged Instacart misled consumers with unlawful tactics, causing them to pay higher fees while also denying refunds.\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated Instacart\u2019s \u201cfree delivery\u201d claims are misleading because customers are still required to pay a mandatory service fee, which can add up to 15% to their total order.\nThe agency also said the delivery platform\u2019s \u201c100% satisfaction guarantee\u201d promise is false because it implies it will provide full refunds when consumers are not fully satisfied with their orders, which is typically not the case when people receive late deliveries or unprofessional service.\nAdditionally, Instacart hid the refund option from the \u201cself-service\u201d menu that consumers use to report problems with their orders, making people believe they could only get a credit toward a future order rather than a refund, the FTC claimed.\nInstacart also failed to clearly disclose terms relating to the Instacart+ membership enrollment process, the agency said. The sign-up process for the free trial of the subscription service did not disclose consumers would be charged once the trial ended, which allowed Instacart to charge people without their informed consent. These consumers will be receiving refunds as a result of the settlement, the FTC said.\n\u201cThe FTC is focused on monitoring online delivery services to ensure that competitors are transparently competing on price and delivery terms,\u201d said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\nInstacart acknowledged the settlement in a blog post and denied \u201cany allegations of wrongdoing.\u201d The company also said it believes \u201cthe foundation of the FTC\u2019s inquiry was fundamentally flawed.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe settlement comes as Instacart is currently under fire over a recent study that revealed its AI-powered pricing tool is causing some customers to receive different prices for the same items at the same stores. Instacart responded to the controversy by stating that retailers determine their own prices, and any pricing tests conducted through its AI tool are random and not influenced by user data. Reuters reported on Wednesday the FTC has begun an investigation into the delivery platform\u2019s AI pricing tool.\n\ntitle3:\nApple becomes a debt collector with its new developer agreement\ndescription3:\nApple on Wednesday released an updated developer license agreement that gives the company permission to recoup unpaid funds, such as commissions or any other fees, by deducting them from in-app purchases it processes on developers\u2019 behalf, among other methods.\nThe change will impact developers in regions where local law allows them to link to external payment systems. In these cases, developers must report those payments back to Apple to pay the required commissions or fees.\nThe changed agreement seemingly gives Apple a way to collect what it believes is the correct fee if the company determines a developer has underreported their earnings.\nApple\u2019s policies in this area are complex, but the change could impact developers in markets like the EU, U.S., and, now, Japan, where developers using external payment systems may be required to pay Apple varying fees or commissions depending on local law. (In the U.S., the legality of these commissions is still being disputed. A federal appeals court earlier this month ruled that a district court should consider allowing Apple to collect some commission, though not the full 27% fee it previously charged.)\nIn its new developer agreement, Apple states it will \u201coffset or recoup\u201d what it believes it is owed, including \u201cany amounts collected by Apple on your behalf from end-users.\u201d This means Apple could recoup funds from developers\u2019 in-app purchases \u2014 like those for digital goods, services, and subscriptions \u2014 or from one-time fees for paid applications.\nAdditionally, Apple notes that it has the right to collect this money \u201cat any time\u201d and \u201cfrom time to time,\u201d meaning developers could face surprise deductions if Apple believes they\u2019ve miscalculated what they owe.\nThe agreement doesn\u2019t specify how Apple will determine whether it\u2019s owed money.\nThe types of developer payments that vary over time are limited and include commissions, fees, and taxes. Among these is the Core Technology Fee (CTF) in the EU, which currently costs \u20ac0.50 for each first annual install exceeding one million in the past 12 months. In January 2026, Apple will transition from the CTF to a new fee, called the Core Technology Commission (CTC), a more complicated percentage-based fee. Apple will collect the CTC from apps that use external payment methods or are distributed under its alternative business terms for the EU.\nThe updated developer agreement also gives Apple the right to collect unpaid amounts from any \u201caffiliates, parents, or subsidiaries\u201d related to the account that owes money. In practical terms, that means Apple could collect the money from developers\u2019 other apps, or from apps published by a parent company.\nThese changes are detailed in Schedules 2 and 3, section 3.4, which focuses on the delivery of applications to end users.\nThese are not the only modifications to the agreement. Apple is also introducing sections devoted to its age assurance technology, new terms for iOS apps in Japan, and other requirements.\nOf interest, Apple is defining requirements for voice-based assistants (like AI chatbots) that are activated via the side button on the iPhone and is banning recordings made without user awareness. This includes audio and video recordings, as well as screen recordings, which are often used by developers to identity issues users face when navigating apps or to locate bugs.\nTo be clear, Apple isn\u2019t banning these recordings outright. The company is simply adding language that says: \u201cYour Application may not be designed to facilitate Recordings of others without their awareness.\u201d How Apple will interpret that rule remains to be seen.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.\n\ntitle4:\nChatGPT's mobile app hits new milestone of $3B in consumer spending\ndescription4:\nChatGPT has hit a new milestone of $3 billion in worldwide consumer spending on mobile as of this week, according to estimates from app intelligence provider Appfigures. This figure represents the total spending on iOS and Android devices since the app\u2019s launch in May 2023, when it first arrived, then only on iOS.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nWhat\u2019s notable is that the bulk of that spending took place this year. Worldwide, consumers spent an estimated $2.48 billion in the ChatGPT mobile app in 2025, representing a 408% year-over-year increase from the $487 million spent in 2024. In 2023, the app\u2019s first year of availability, it earned $42.9 million, before growing 1,036% to reach the 2024 figure.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nThese numbers represent a sharp rise in consumer adoption, compared with other popular apps. For instance, it took ChatGPT 31 months to reach $3 billion in consumer spending, but the top earner, TikTok, took 58 months to do so, Appfigures told TechCrunch.\nChatGPT also reached the milestone faster than top streaming apps like Disney+ and HBO Max, which hit the $3 billion figure in 42 months and 46 months, respectively.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nxAI\u2019s Grok, however, is seeing a similar revenue trajectory to ChatGPT, compared with other AI rivals.\nGrok was released in late 2023 to X Premium Plus subscribers before becoming more broadly available last year. But if you compare the pace of consumer spending across AI apps, Grok came the closest to matching ChatGPT\u2019s cumulative revenue at the same point, once it began monetizing. (You can see this on the chart below, which plots the AI apps\u2019 spending aligned to when each app began monetizing.)\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nWhile the $3 billion in spending represents a significant uptake by consumers, it\u2019s not the only way to measure AI app adoption or potential long-term revenue.\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile customers are buying paid subscriptions, like the $20 per month ChatGPT Plus or the $200 per month ChatGPT Pro for advanced users. But AI apps can generate revenue in other ways, including through developer offerings and, perhaps soon for ChatGPT, ads. In addition, ChatGPT on Wednesday launched its own app store of sorts, which the company suggests will be monetized in some way in the future, its blog post noted.\nGoogle, meanwhile, is exploring the potential to transition its healthy search ads business to AI-powered search, placing ads in AI Mode, AI Overviews, AI shopping, and an increasingly AI-powered Discover page, among other things.\nAnthropic is aiming at the business market and is reportedly on track for $70 billion in revenue by 2028.\"\n\nResponse:",
