Murati said she is stepping away to do her own exploration after more than six years at the AI startup.\n\u201cAfter much reflection, I have made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI,\u201d she said in the post. \u201cThere\u2019s never an ideal time to step away from a place one cherishes, yet this moment feels right \u2026 My six-and-a-half years with the OpenAI team have been an extraordinary privilege.\u201d\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment further, directing TechCrunch to Murati\u2019s tweet.\nCEO Sam Altman responded to Murati\u2019s tweet by thanking her in another post. \u201cWe\u2019ll say more about the transition plans soon, but for now, I want to take a moment to just feel thanks,\u201d said Altman. \u201cI feel tremendous gratitude towards her for what she has helped us build and accomplish, but I most of all feel personal gratitude towards her for the support and love during all the hard times.\u201d\nI replied with this. Mira, thank you for everything.\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how much Mira has meant to OpenAI, our mission, and to us all personally.\nI feel tremendous gratitude towards her for what she has helped us build and accomplish, but I most of all feel personal\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) September 25, 2024\nThe decision comes just a week before OpenAI\u2019s DevDay, its annual developer conference.\nWhen Altman was abruptly fired late last year by OpenAI\u2019s previous board of directors, the board briefly installed Murati as interim CEO. Murati was reportedly among those, along with ex-OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who approached the rest of the board prior to Altman\u2019s ouster to express concerns about his behavior.\nAltman is increasingly asserting control over OpenAI and its image.\nOn Monday, Altman penned a blog post saying, among other hyperboles, that OpenAI could achieve \u201csuperintelligence\u201d in the next few years. He\u2019s also reportedly poised to receive equity in OpenAI for the first time as the company prepares to move away from its nonprofit governance structure.\nMurati came to OpenAI in 2018 as VP of applied AI and partnerships. After being promoted to CTO in 2022, she led the company\u2019s work on the viral AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT, the text-to-image AI DALL-E, and the code-generating system Codex, which powers GitHub\u2019s Copilot product.\nShe has a degree in mechanical engineering from Dartmouth College and previously worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs and then at Zodiac Aerospace, the French aerospace group. She spent three years at Tesla as a senior product manager of the Model X, the automaker\u2019s crossover SUV, during which Tesla released early versions of Autopilot, its AI-enabled driver-assistance software.\nIn 2016, Murati joined Leap Motion, a startup building hand- and finger-tracking motion sensors for PCs, as VP of product and engineering. Murati wanted to make the experience of interacting with a computer \u201cas intuitive as playing with a ball,\u201d she told Fast Company in an interview. But she soon realized that the tech, which relied on a VR headset, was too early.\nAs OpenAI\u2019s CTO, Murati developed a bit of a reputation for making controversial pronouncements.\nShe once vaguely claimed in an interview that OpenAI\u2019s AI would achieve \u201cPh.D.-level\u201d intelligence. And in June, Murati raised eyebrows when she suggested that AI would replace creative jobs that \u201cshouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cSome creative jobs maybe will go away, but maybe they shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place if the content that comes out of it is not very high quality,\u201d Murati said in an onstage interview at The Wall Street Journal\u2019s WSJ Tech Live Conference. \u201cI really believe that using it as a tool for education [and] creativity will expand our intelligence and creativity and imagination.\u201d\nMurati is the latest high-level exec to depart OpenAI in recent months. Sutskever and former safety leader Jan Leike announced their departures in May, and co-founder John Schulman said last month that he was leaving to join rival Anthropic. Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s president, Greg Brockman, is on extended leave through the end of the year.\nMurati\u2019s decision to step down comes as OpenAI is said to be pursuing a funding round that would value the company at over $150 billion. Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, and Thrive Capital are reportedly in talks to invest; the round could end up being as large as $6.5 billion, per Bloomberg and others.\nOpenAI desperately needs the money. According to The Information, the company has spent approximately $7 billion on model training and $1.5 billion on staffing. At one point in time, ChatGPT alone was said to be costing OpenAI around $700,000 a day to run; Altman has said that training the company\u2019s once-flagship GPT-4 model cost over $100 million.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta Connect 2024: Orion glasses, Quest 3S headset, Meta AI upgrades, Ray-Ban Meta real-time video, and more\ndescription1:\nMeta Connect 2024 is a developer-centric event featuring a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He showcased new hardware and software to support two of Meta\u2019s big ambitions: AI and the metaverse. This included everything from new Quest headsets, updates to Meta\u2019s Llama AI model, and even a new fully AR glasses prototype.\nMeta Connect 2024 kicked off live at 10 a.m. PT. You can stream it from Meta Connect\u2019s site, on Meta\u2019s developer Facebook page, and you can even stream it in Horizon Worlds from your Meta Quest headset if you really want to feel the full immersion.\nWe\u2019ll be compiling all of the announcements and reveals out of Meta Connect 2024 below and will keep it updated throughout the event and after as more reactions and analysis arrive.\nMeta reveals Orion, \u201cthe most advanced glasses the world has ever seen\u201d\nImage Credits: Meta\nIn a surprise announcement, Zuckerberg dramatically revealed Orion, which Meta says will eventually become the company\u2019s \u201cfirst consumer full holographic AR glasses,\u201d though they won\u2019t be arriving on any consumers\u2019 faces anytime soon. Touting Orion\u2019s light weight, compatibility for hand-tracking and eye-tracking, and most ambitiously, a neural interface, Zuckerberg also touted some impressed, and famous, early testers (including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). The Orion glasses were presented as the future of Meta\u2019s AR efforts, with our own ongoing coverage of Meta Connect\u2019s final big reveal here.\nWe see that TechCrunch logo, Meta \ud83d\udc40 Image Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s Quest 3S headset launches for $299\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s reveal of the Quest 3S was indicated by several pre-event leaks and confirmed during Connect 2024. The Meta Quest 3S comes as a less expensive alternative to the Quest 3, starting at $299 for a 128GB version and 256GB for $399. The entirely wireless headset is compatible with the existing library of Quest apps and games, though Meta was particularly enthusiastic about its mixed-reality features. With the reveal of the Quest 3S, the Quest 3 will drop from $649 to $499. Get our early impressions of the new Quest 3S here ahead of its October 15 ship date.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1838992643319021592\nQuest 2, Quest Pro discontinued\n\u201cWith Quest 3S on the shelf, we\u2019re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We\u2019ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they\u2019re gone, whichever comes first,\u201d Meta told TechCrunch about the discontinuation of two of their headsets in the wake of the Quest 3S announcement.\nMeta AI gets vocal\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta AI is finding its voice. Users can ask a question or otherwise chat with Meta AI out loud through Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram and get simulated vocal responses in return. The digital voice assistant will roll out with multiple voice options to choose from, including the AI voices of celebrities like Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Awkwafina, Kristen Bell, and Keegan-Michael Key.\nThe reveal comes a day after OpenAI announced the long-awaited rollout of its Advanced Voice Mode feature, with a new look and five new voices. And speaking of vocal announcements, Zuckerberg touted that Meta AI now has 500 million users.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1838999866724262105\nMeta\u2019s Llama 3.2 AI model released\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s multilingual Llama family of models has reached version 3.2, signifying that several Llama models are now multimodal. Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can interpret charts and graphs, caption images, and pinpoint objects in pictures given a simple description.\nLlama 3.2 11B and 90B might be able to look at a map of a park and tell you how long a certain path is, or when the terrain could become steeper. Or, provided a graph showing a company\u2019s revenue over the course of a year, the models can quickly spotlight the best-performing months of the bunch.\nNotably, Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can\u2019t be accessed in Europe due to the EU\u2019s Act restrictions. As a result, several Meta AI features available elsewhere, like image analysis, are disabled for European users.\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta sunglasses get real-time AI video and reminders\nImage Credits: Meta\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses are getting upgrades as the company continues to try and make the case that the smart glasses can become the next big consumer device. At the forefront of the pitch is the addition of real-time AI video processing, which lets you to ask the Ray-Ban Meta glasses questions about what it can see in front of you.\nThe sunglasses will also be getting a smartphone-like reminder feature; live language translation between English and French, Italian, or Spanish; and full integration with music streaming apps like Amazon Music, Audible, and iHeart Radio.\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses will have real-time AI video processing, allowing you to ask questions about what the glasses can see. pic.twitter.com/KO0LlMvT3y \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 25, 2024\nMeta AI explores visual search\nImage Credits: Meta\nIn a feature that will be familiar to anyone following OpenAI, Google, and Apple\u2019s application of image-based searches, Meta showcased its AI\u2019s capacity to respond to prompts based on images, as well as edit photos provided to the AI based on feedback given by the user. It can also share them to Instagram Stories.\nMore AI in your Facebook feeds\nImage Credits: Meta\nIf you\u2019re on Facebook, you\u2019ve probably seen a lot of AI recently, knowingly or unknowingly. There\u2019s an entire nascent industry around using it to generate engagement bait. Earlier this month, the label noting whether content has been edited using Meta\u2019s tools was shrunk down. And now Facebook will actually pitch you on AI content that it generates for you that it thinks you\u2019ll want to share or engage with.\nTests for translated, dubbed content from creators\nImage Credits: Meta\nGoing a step beyond just translating captions, Meta announced a test that would use its AI translation tools to take creator content, create a translated dub, and sync the creator\u2019s lips accordingly. So far, the experiment is limited to creator videos made in the U.S. and Latin America, with translations between English and Spanish.\nMeta demonstrates a test of its AI translation tools for creator content that dubs and syncs the creator\u2019s lips. pic.twitter.com/ziHyX1H65i \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 25, 2024\nBatman, Wordle, and the rest of the games announcements\nA number of new experiences were revealed for the Quest ecosystem at Meta Connect 2024, led by Batman: Arkham Shadow, which launches October 22 and will also be bundled with new Quest 3 and 3S purchases until April of next year. Beyond games with familiar concepts like Alien: Rogue Incursion for Xenomorph-filled horror and a remake of the zombie game Arizona Sunshine, Wordle of all things was announced for the Quest. The VR version of the daily puzzle will be free to play without a New York Times subscription.\n\ntitle2:\nSurging AI demand could cause the world's next chip shortage: Report\ndescription2:\nGeorgijevic | E+ | Getty Images\nA surge in demand for artificial intelligence-focused semiconductors and AI-enabled smartphones and laptops could lead to the next global chip shortage, according to a report released Wednesday by consultancy Bain & Co. The last major semiconductor shortage happened during the Covid-19 pandemic amid supply chain disruption and a rise in demand for consumer electronics as people were forced to stay and work at home. Technology giants have been snapping up graphics processing units, or GPUs, mainly from Nvidia . These GPUs which are housed in data centers are critical for the training of huge AI models which underpin applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nMeanwhile, companies like Qualcomm are designing chips that go into smartphones and personal computers and allow those devices to run AI applications locally rather than via an internet connection in the cloud. These are often referred to as AI-enabled devices and companies from Samsung to Microsoft have released such products. Bain said demand for GPUs and AI consumer electronics could be the cause of a chip shortage. \"Surging demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has caused shortages in specific elements of the semiconductor value chain,\" Anne Hoecker, head of the technology practice in the Americas at Bain, told CNBC by email. \"If we combine the growth in demand for GPUs alongside a wave of AI-enabled devices, which could accelerate PC product refresh cycles, there could be more widespread constraints on semiconductor supply.\" However, it's unclear at this point how much demand such AI-enabled gadgets will have, given what appears to be a cautious approach to them from consumers so far. Bain noted that the semiconductor supply chain is \"incredibly complex, and a demand increase of about 20% or more has a high likelihood of upsetting the equilibrium and causing a chip shortage.\" \"The AI explosion across the confluence of the large end markets could easily surpass that threshold, creating vulnerable chokepoints throughout the supply chain,\" the report added.\nwatch now\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle files EU antitrust complaint accusing Microsoft of stifling cloud competition\ndescription3:\nGoogle filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission on Wednesday accusing Microsoft of using unfair licensing contracts to stifle competition in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing industry.\nAt the heart of Google's complaint is the allegation that Microsoft uses unfair licensing terms to \"lock in\" clients and exert control over the cloud market.\nGoogle alleges that Microsoft, through its dominant Windows Server and Microsoft Office products, can make it difficult for its massive roster of clients to use anything but its Azure cloud infrastructure offering.\nThe internet giant said in its complaint that restrictions contained in Microsoft's cloud licensing terms make it harder for customers to move their workloads from Microsoft's Azure cloud technology to competitors' clouds, despite there being no technical barriers to doing so.\nEuropean businesses and public sector organizations have been forced to pay the firm up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year in licensing penalties due to restrictions on customers' ability to switch from one cloud provider to another, Google said, citing a 2023 study by CISPE, a trade body for the cloud computing sector.\nThe antitrust complaint from Google arrives after CISPE and its members in July agreed to a settlement with Microsoft which would see the firm make changes to address competition concerns.\nReferring to the CISPE settlement, Microsoft said in a statement Wednesday that it expects the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, to dismiss Google's complaint.\n\"Microsoft settled amicably similar concerns raised by European cloud providers, even after Google hoped they would keep litigating,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email. \"Having failed to persuade European companies, we expect Google similarly will fail to persuade the European Commission.\"\n\ntitle4:\nMeta unveils $299 Quest 3S VR headset, Orion AR glasses prototype\ndescription4:\nIn this article META Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nA Meta employee sets up a Quest 3S, a new entry-level model of Meta's mixed reality headset, for demonstrations for content creators and journalists ahead of Meta Connect, Meta's annual event on its latest software and hardware innovations, in Menlo Park, California, on September 24, 2024. Julie Jammot | Afp | Getty Images\nMeta announced the Quest 3S, the latest virtual reality headset to come out of the company's Reality Labs division and a cheaper offering than its predecessor. The device will go on sale on Oct. 15, and it'll retail starting at $299, down from the $499 starting price for 2023's Quest 3. The device can be used to watch movies, as well as run VR fitness apps and gaming, Meta said Wednesday at its Connect event in Menlo Park, California. The company positioned the headset as a multitasking computer, putting it in competition with Apple's $3,499 Vision Pro headset that launched in February. In addition to the Quest 3S, Meta on Wednesday also showcased its latest prototype of augmented-reality smart glasses and announced a flurry of new features for its Meta AI chatbot. Meta's previous Quest devices are the bestselling VR headsets, with millions shipped thanks to heavy marketing and a lower price than many competitors, but those efforts have yet to spark a cultural phenomenon or a mainstream software ecosystem around VR. Including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has poured more than $65 billion in expenses into its hardware efforts. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company's spending as a strategic initiative to prevent Apple from controlling future hardware platforms. Although there was hope among VR developers that Apple's entry into the market would spur a wave of new apps and users, Apple hasn't revealed sales for its headset and reports suggest that sales have been in small volumes, under 1 million units, partially due to its high price.\nWhat it does\nMeta\nA Meta representative said the \"S\" in Quest 3S stands for \"start\" \u2014 as in getting started with VR. Many of the new Meta features that the company discussed for the $299 Quest 3S have counterparts on Apple's Vision Pro, including a mode that allows for the device to be used on an airplane and another that simulates a large movie theater inside the headset. Meta highlighted improved \"passthrough,\" the term used to described when a VR headset uses cameras and sensors on the outside of the device to display live real-time video inside the headset. That function is intended to make users feel like they are looking through a display and allows them to interact with the real world while keeping the headset on. For the Quest 3S, Meta added a dedicated button to turn on passthrough. The company has emphasized the ability of the Quest 3S to multitask and run apps, positioning it as a computing device, instead of a game console. \"All the things you can do with a general purpose computer, Quest is the full package,\" Zuckerberg said. In demos provided Tuesday, Meta showcased the device running as many as four apps at one time on floating screens inside the headset, including a YouTube video, a browser, Amazon Music and Meta's app store. Meta says the headset can handle six windows. But the demo experience was not smooth. The Amazon Music app crashed, window controls would disappear and Meta's controllers would fall asleep after a few minutes if the user wasn't pressing buttons. Besides the Quest 3S, Meta also announced a price cut for last's year Quest 3, bringing the price of the 512GB version down from $649 to $499. The Quest 3 has more advanced lenses and a superior screen with a higher resolution than the Quest 3S. Additionally, Meta said it will discontinue the Quest Pro, its $999 headset launched in 2022 that never gained much momentum, and the older Quest 2 headset.\nEventually, glasses\nMeta Orion AR glasses prototype Meta\nZuckerberg's justification for spending so much on VR and AR is his belief that the technology will eventually end up in lightweight, transparent glasses that overlay computer graphics and information onto the real world. Investing in VR software and hardware are early steps toward those glasses, which could take as much as a decade to develop, Zuckerberg previously said. Zuckerberg showed off an early concept of what those glasses could look like on Wednesday. The thick, black-framed prototype, called Orion, won't be sold to consumers, but Meta says they will be used internally as the company continues working toward the consumer glasses it hopes to one day sell. \"This is where we are going,\" Zuckerberg said. Meta hopes the next version of Orion will be available to consumers as the company's first full AR glasses, Zuckerberg said without giving a timetable for when that may be. Orion is Meta's first \"fully-functioning\" prototype AR glasses, Zuckerberg said, and the device is tethered wirelessly to a small \"puck.\" The prototype uses a wristband component to pick up on users neural signals and let them control the Orion glasses using their brains. That technology stems from the company's 2019 acquisition of CTRL-Labs. Orion enables users to play games, multi-task with multiple windows and videoconference with people around the world represented by a realistic avatar, Zuckerberg said. Meta's Orion prototype comes a week after Snap announced its fifth-generation Spectacles AR glasses. Those thick-framed glasses will only be made available to developers, who must commit to paying $99 a month for one full year if they want to build AR apps for the device. This isn't the first time Meta publicly revealed a prototype of a future devices or research projects to signal to investors and employees where VR and AR technology is headed. The Orion glasses are an improvement on Project Nazare, prototype smart glasses that Zuckerberg announced in 2021, when the company changed its name from Facebook.\nRay-Ban Meta smart glasses are powered by a Qualcomm chip. Qualcomm, Samsung and Google are working on smart glasses, according to Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nMeta does sell a pair of glasses with a built-in camera in partnership with EssilorLuxottica called Ray-Ban Meta, which start at $299 and were announced in 2023. While these glasses don't have any displays, they do have tiny speakers that allow the device to play music or interact with Meta AI, the company's voice assistant. As part of Wednesday's event, Meta announced new Meta AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses. For example, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses will be able to detect when a user is looking at a sign in Spanish and, if asked, can translate in the user's ear, a new improvement, Meta said. The camera can scan QR codes, and it can also extract information like book titles out of photos it takes. Another new capability for the glasses is the ability to remember facts like where the user parked. Li-Chen Miller, the vice president of product in charge of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, told CNBC that when she travels, she uses the glasses to take photos of her hotel room door, and later, she asks Meta AI to recall the number. Those features will become available \"later this year,\" the company said. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have sold more than 730,000 units in their first three quarters, according to market researcher IDC. In July, Zuckerberg told investors that they were \"a bigger hit sooner than expected.\" Last week, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced that they had extended their partnership to develop more smart glasses.\nwatch now\nAI that speaks\nZuckerberg also introduced improvements to its Meta AI chatbot that will allow people to interact with it using their voice in addition to written prompts. With voice, users will be able to have oral conversations with Meta AI, which is accessed through Meta's apps. Users will be able to perform actions using their voice, such as telling Meta AI to take a photo by talking to their smartphone. For Meta AI's new feature, the company is using computer-generated voices from celebrities including Awkwafina, Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key and Kristen Bell. The new Siri-like Meta AI voice feature will be available over the next month for U.S., Canadian, Australian and New Zealand users of WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. The Meta AI announcement comes a day after rival OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced an advanced voice feature for people who pay for its premium service. Meta's new chatbot features are based on the company's AI model, Llama. Meta on Wednesday announced a newer version of Llama, called Llama 3.2. This updated model can understand both images and text, an upgrade from its predecessors which generated responses to people's written prompts.
