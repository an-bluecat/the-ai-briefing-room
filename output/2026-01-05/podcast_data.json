The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.\n\u201cVera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.\u201d Huang told the audience. \u201cToday, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.\u201d\nThe Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia\u2019s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.\nRubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE\u2019s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.\nNamed for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.\nExplaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia\u2019s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.\n\u201cAs you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,\u201d Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. \u201cSo we\u2019ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAs expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia\u2019s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.\nRubin\u2019s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\ntitle1:\nAMD unveils new AI PC processors for general use and gaming at CES\ndescription1:\nAMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su kicked off her keynote at CES 2026 with a message about what compute could deliver: AI for everyone.\nAs part of that promise, AMD announced a new line of AI processors as the company thinks AI-powered personal computers are the way of the future.\nThe semiconductor giant revealed AMD Ryzen AI 400 Series processor, its latest version of its AI-powered PC chips, at the yearly CES conference on Monday. The company says the latest version of its Ryzen processor series allows for 1.3x faster multitasking than its competitors and are 1.7x times faster at content creation.\nThese new chips feature 12 CPU Cores, individual processing units inside a core processor, and 24 threads, independent streams of instruction\nThis is an upgrade to the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor that was announced in 2024. AMD started producing the Ryzen processor series in 2017.\nRahul Tikoo, senior vice president and general manager of AMD\u2019s client business, said AMD has expanded to over 250 AI PC platforms on the company\u2019s recent press briefing. That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.\n\u201cIn the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,\u201d Tikoo said. \u201cOur AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.\n\u201cNo matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,\u201d Tikoo said. \u201cYou have thousands of interactions with your PC every day. AI is able to understand, learn context, bring automation, provide deep reasoning and personal customization to every individual.\u201d\nPCs that include either the Ryzen AI 300 Series processor or the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D processor become available in the first quarter of 2026.\nThe company also announced the latest version of its Redstone ray tracing technology, which simulates physical behavior of light, which allows for better video game graphics without a performance or speed lag.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\n\ntitle2:\nBoston Dynamics' next-gen humanoid robot will have Google DeepMind DNA\ndescription2:\nRobotics company Boston Dynamics has struck a partnership with Google\u2019s AI research lab to speed up the development of its next-generation humanoid robot Atlas \u2014 and make it act more human around people.\nThe partnership, which was announced Monday during the Hyundai press conference at CES 2026, is centered on robotics research that will use Google DeepMind\u2019s AI foundation models. Boston Dynamics\u2019 humanoid robot Atlas will be the first test case, according to Carolina Parada, senior director of robotics at Google DeepMind.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to integrate our cutting-edge AI foundation models with Boston Dynamics\u2019 new Atlas robots, and we\u2019ll aim to develop the world\u2019s most advanced robot foundation model to fulfill the promise of true general-purpose human needs,\u201d Parada said onstage.\nThe tie-up comes less than a year after the Google AI research lab announced new AI models called Gemini Robotics that are designed to allow robots to perceive, reason, use tools, and interact with humans. Gemini Robotics is based on a large-scale multimodal generative AI model, Gemini. At the time, Google DeepMind said the robotics AI model was trained to generalize behavior across a range of different robotics hardware.\nEnter Boston Dynamics, and its majority owner, Hyundai Motor Group. While accelerating research will be a central piece of this partnership, this has real-world scaling intent.\nBoston Dynamics already has products, like the quadruped Spot, that are in customers\u2019 hands in more than 40 countries. Its warehouse robot Stretch has unloaded more than 20 million boxes globally since its launch in 2023, according to Hyundai. Now Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are preparing for the next generation, starting with the humanoid robot Atlas, which the company announced Monday is already in production and headed to the Hyundai factory in Savannah, Georgia\nA prototype of Atlas walked onstage during the press conference, showing off its ability to move. But as Alberto Rodriguez, director of Atlas behavior at Boston Dynamics, noted, making \u201cAtlas into a product requires more than athletic performance for humanoids to really deliver on their promise. They have to be able to interact with people naturally.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nRodriguez and his counterparts at Boston Dynamics believe that recent advancements in AI have created a clear path to get to those capabilities. That kind of natural interaction with humans has real safety implications.\nThe Atlas product, which was also revealed onstage Monday and will eventually head to Hyundai\u2019s factory, has 56 degrees of freedom with rotation joints and human-scale hands that have tactile sensing. And it\u2019s strong. The Atlas robot can lift up to 110 pounds and is designed to perform repetitive movements.\nWith that kind of dexterity and strength, it will be critical for Atlas, or any humanoid robot, to safely interact and work with humans. Some of that has been handled on the hardware side; Atlas, for instance, has 360-degree cameras to allow it to see when people are approaching. But DeepMind\u2019s work could help the robots learn how to act.\n\u201cRather than having a set of predefined, loaded tasks onto the robot, we think robots should understand the physical world the same way we do,\u201dParada said. \u201cThey should be able to learn from their experience. Should be able to generalize new situations and get better over time. So whether it is to assemble a new car part or to tie your shoelaces, robots should learn the same way we do from a handful of examples, and then get better very quickly with a little bit of practice.\u201d\nHyundai, which plans to bring Atlas to its factory this year and eventually deploy them for tasks like parts sequencing by 2028, has also developed protocols to increase safety and efficiency.\nHyundai said Monday it is opening a U.S. facility this year called a Robot Metaplant Application Center, or RMAC, that will teach robots how to map movements like lifts and turns. Training data from RMAC will be combined with real-world data collected via a software platform used in its Georgia factory to continually improve the robots.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the annual CES conference here.\nThis article was updated to include more information about Atlas\u2019 specs.\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia launches Alpamayo, open AI models that allow autonomous vehicles to 'think like a human'\ndescription3:\nAt CES 2026, Nvidia launched Alpamayo, a new family of open source AI models, simulation tools, and datasets for training physical robots and vehicles that are designed to help autonomous vehicles reason through complex driving situations.\n\u201cThe ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here \u2013 when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. \u201cAlpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions.\u201d\nAt the core of Nvidia\u2019s new family is Alpamayo 1, a 10 billion-parameter chain-of-thought, reason-based vision language action (VLA) model that allows an AV to think more like a human so it can solve complex edge cases \u2014 like how to navigate a traffic light outage at a busy intersection \u2014 without previous experience.\n\u201cIt does this by breaking down problems into steps, reasoning through every possibility, and then selecting the safest path,\u201d Ali Kani, Nvidia\u2019s vice president of automotive, said Monday during a press briefing.\nOr as Huang put it during his keynote on Monday: \u201cNot only does [Alpamayo] take sensor input and activate steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it\u2019s about to take. It tells you what action it\u2019s going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action. And then, of course, the trajectory.\u201d\nAlpamayo 1\u2019s underlying code is available on Hugging Face. Developers can fine-tune Alpamayo into smaller, faster versions for vehicle development, use it to train simpler driving systems, or build tools on top of it like auto-labeling systems that automatically tag video data or evaluators that check if a car made a smart decision.\n\u201cThey can also use Cosmos to generate synthetic data and then train and test their Alpamayo-based AV application on the combination of the real and synthetic dataset,\u201d Kani said. Cosmos is Nvidia\u2019s brand of generative world models, AI systems that create a representation of a physical environment so they can make predictions and take actions.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The company is additionally launching AlpaSim, an open source simulation framework for validating autonomous driving systems. Available on GitHub, AlpaSim is designed to recreate real-world driving conditions, from sensors to traffic, so developers can safely test systems at scale.\n\ntitle4:\nThis is Uber's new robotaxi from Lucid and Nuro\ndescription4:\nUber, Lucid Motors, and Nuro have revealed the production-intent version of their collaborative robotaxi at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show, and TechCrunch got a sneak peek ahead of the reveal.\nIt\u2019s a vehicle that\u2019s been in the works for more than half a year now, part of a deal that saw Uber invest $300 million into Lucid and commit to buying 20,000 of the company\u2019s EVs. On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.\nBased on the Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted \u201chalo.\u201d The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia\u2019s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo\u2019s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).\nCrucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it\u2019s being built at Lucid Motors\u2019 Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)\nImage Credits:Sean O'Kane\nThe vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.\nAnyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians.\nThe companies did not have an interactive version of the software \u2014 which is being created by Uber \u2014 ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity\u2019s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel.\nUber chose to build this forthcoming \u201cpremium\u201d robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.)\nThat said, the Gravity\u2019s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the \u201cfrustrations\u201d they experienced.\nLucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday announced that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.\nUber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid\u2019s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.\"\n\nResponse:",
