Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Here\u2019s what it means.\ndescription0:\nA federal proposal that would ban states and local governments from regulating AI for 10 years could soon be signed into law, as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and other lawmakers work to secure its inclusion into a GOP megabill ahead of a key July 4 deadline.\nThose in favor \u2013 including OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, Anduril\u2019s Palmer Luckey, and a16z\u2019s Marc Andreessen \u2013 argue that a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of AI regulation among states would stifle American innovation at a time when the race to beat China is heating up.\nCritics include most Democrats, many Republicans, Anthropic\u2019s CEO Dario Amodei, labor groups, AI safety nonprofits, and consumer rights advocates. They warn that this provision would block states from passing laws that protect consumers from AI harms and would effectively allow powerful AI firms to operate without much oversight or accountability.\nOn Friday, a group of 17 Republican governors wrote to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has advocated for a \u201clight touch\u201d approach to AI regulation, and House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for the so-called \u201cAI moratorium\u201d to be stripped from the budget reconciliation bill, per Axios.\nThe provision was squeezed into the bill, nicknamed the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d in May. It is designed to prohibit states from \u201c[enforcing] any law or regulation regulating [AI] models, [AI] systems, or automated decision systems\u201d for a decade.\nSuch a measure could preempt state AI laws that have already passed, such as California\u2019s AB 2013, which requires companies to reveal the data used to train AI systems, and Tennessee\u2019s ELVIS Act, which protects musicians and creators from AI-generated impersonations.\nThe moratorium\u2019s reach extends far beyond these examples. Public Citizen has compiled a database of AI-related laws that could be affected by the moratorium. The database reveals that many states have passed laws that overlap, which could actually make it easier for AI companies to navigate the \u201cpatchwork.\u201d For example, Alabama, Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Montana and Texas have criminalized or created civil liability for distributing deceptive AI-generated media meant to influence elections.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe AI moratorium also threatens several noteworthy AI safety bills awaiting signature, including New York\u2019s RAISE Act, which would require large AI labs nationwide to publish thorough safety reports.\nGetting the moratorium into a budget bill has required some creative maneuvering. Because provisions in a budget bill must have a direct fiscal impact, Cruz revised the proposal in June to make compliance with the AI moratorium a condition for states to receive funds from the $42 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program.\nCruz then released another revision on Wednesday, which he says ties the requirement only to the new $500 million in BEAD funding included in the bill \u2013 a separate, additional pot of money. However, close examination of the revised text finds the language also threatens to pull already-obligated broadband funding from states that don\u2019t comply.\nSen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) criticized Cruz\u2019s reconciliation language on Thursday, claiming the provision \u201cforces states receiving BEAD funding to choose between expanding broadband or protecting consumers from AI harms for ten years.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s next?\nSam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, speaks in Berlin on February 07, 2025. Altman said he predicts the pace of artificial intelligence\u2019s usefulness in the next two years will accelerate markedly compared to the last two years. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Image Credits:Sean Gallup / Getty Images\nCurrently, the provision is at a standstill. Cruz\u2019s initial revision passed the procedural review earlier this week, which meant that the AI moratorium would be included in the final bill. However, reporting today from Punchbowl News and Bloomberg suggest that talks have reopened, and conversations on the AI moratorium\u2019s language are ongoing.\nSources familiar with the matter tell TechCrunch they expect the Senate to begin heavy debate this week on amendments to the budget, including one that would strike the AI moratorium. That will be followed by a vote-a-rama \u2013 a series of rapid votes on the full slate of amendments.\nPolitico reported Friday that the Senate is slated to take an initial vote on the megabill on Saturday.\nChris Lehane, chief global affairs officer at OpenAI, said in a LinkedIn post that the \u201ccurrent patchwork approach to regulating AI isn\u2019t working and will continue to worsen if we stay on this path.\u201d He said this would have \u201cserious implications\u201d for the U.S. as it races to establish AI dominance over China.\n\u201cWhile not someone I\u2019d typically quote, Vladimir Putin has said that whoever prevails will determine the direction of the world going forward,\u201d Lehane wrote.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman shared similar sentiments this week during a live recording of the tech podcast Hard Fork. He said while he believes some adaptive regulation that addresses the biggest existential risks of AI would be good, \u201ca patchwork across the states would probably be a real mess and very difficult to offer services under.\u201d\nAltman also questioned whether policymakers were equipped to handle regulating AI when the technology moves so quickly.\n\u201cI worry that if\u2026we kick off a three-year process to write something that\u2019s very detailed and covers a lot of cases, the technology will just move very quickly,\u201d he said.\nBut a closer look at existing state laws tells a different story. Most state AI laws that exist today aren\u2019t far-reaching; they focus on protecting consumers and individuals from specific harms, like deepfakes, fraud, discrimination, and privacy violations. They target the use of AI in contexts like hiring, housing, credit, healthcare, and elections, and include disclosure requirements and algorithmic bias safeguards.\nTechCrunch has asked Lehane and other members of OpenAI\u2019s team if they could name any current state laws that have hindered the tech giant\u2019s ability to progress its technology and release new models. We also asked why navigating different state laws would be considered too complex, given OpenAI\u2019s progress on technologies that may automate a wide range of white-collar jobs in the coming years.\nTechCrunch asked similar questions of Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple, but has not received any answers.\nThe case against preemption\nImage Credits:Maxwell Zeff\n\u201cThe patchwork argument is something that we have heard since the beginning of consumer advocacy time,\u201d Emily Peterson-Cassin, corporate power director at internet activist group Demand Progress, told TechCrunch. \u201cBut the fact is that companies comply with different state regulations all the time. The most powerful companies in the world? Yes. Yes, you can.\u201d\nOpponents and cynics alike say the AI moratorium isn\u2019t about innovation \u2013 it\u2019s about sidestepping oversight. While many states have passed regulation around AI, Congress, which moves notoriously slowly, has passed zero laws regulating AI.\n\u201cIf the federal government wants to pass strong AI safety legislation, and then preempt the states\u2019 ability to do that, I\u2019d be the first to be very excited about that,\u201d said Nathan Calvin, VP of state affairs at the nonprofit Encode \u2013 which has sponsored several state AI safety bills \u2013 in an interview. \u201cInstead, [the AI moratorium] takes away all leverage, and any ability, to force AI companies to come to the negotiating table.\u201d\nOne of the loudest critics of the proposal is Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Amodei said \u201ca 10-year moratorium is far too blunt an instrument.\u201d\n\u201cAI is advancing too head-spinningly fast,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe that these systems could change the world, fundamentally, within two years; in 10 years, all bets are off. Without a clear plan for a federal response, a moratorium would give us the worst of both worlds \u2014 no ability for states to act, and no national policy as a backstop.\u201d\nHe argued that instead of prescribing how companies should release their products, the government should work with AI companies to create a transparency standard for how companies share information about their practices and model capabilities.\nThe opposition isn\u2019t limited to Democrats. There\u2019s been notable opposition to the AI moratorium from Republicans who argue the provision stomps on the GOP\u2019s traditional support for states\u2019 rights, even though it was crafted by prominent Republicans like Cruz and Rep. Jay Obernolte.\nThese Republican critics include Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) who is concerned about states\u2019 rights and is working with Democrats to strip it from the bill. Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) also criticized the provision, arguing that states need to protect their citizens and creative industries from AI harms. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) even went so far as to say she would oppose the entire budget if the moratorium remains.\nWhat do Americans want?\nRepublicans like Cruz and Senate Majority Leader John Thune say they want a \u201clight touch\u201d approach to AI governance. Cruz also said in a statement that \u201cevery American deserves a voice in shaping\u201d the future.\nHowever, a recent Pew Research survey found that most Americans seem to want more regulation around AI. The survey found that about 60% of U.S. adults and 56% of AI experts say they\u2019re more concerned that the U.S. government won\u2019t go far enough in regulating AI than they are that the government will go too far. Americans also largely aren\u2019t confident that the government will regulate AI effectively, and they are skeptical of industry efforts around responsible AI.\nThis article has been updated to reflect newer reporting on the Senate\u2019s timeline to vote on the bill and fresh Republican opposition to the AI moritorium.\n\ntitle1:\nAs job losses loom, Anthropic launches program to track AI's economic fallout\ndescription1:\nSilicon Valley has opined on the promise of generative AI to forge new career paths and economic opportunities \u2013 like the newly coveted solo unicorn startup. Banks and analysts have touted AI\u2019s potential to boost GDP. But those gains are unlikely to be distributed equally in the face of what many expect to be widespread AI-related job loss.\nAmid this backdrop, Anthropic on Friday launched its Economic Futures Program, a new initiative to support research on AI\u2019s impacts on the labor market and global economy and to develop policy proposals to prepare for the shift.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s asking questions about what are the economic impacts [of AI], both positive and negative,\u201d Sarah Heck, head of policy programs and partnerships at Anthropic, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to root these conversations in evidence and not have predetermined outcomes or views on what\u2019s going to [happen].\u201d\nAt least one prominent name has shared his views on the potential economic impact of AI: Anthropic\u2019s CEO Dario Amodei. In May, Amodei predicted that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs and spike unemployment to as high as 20% in the next one to five years.\nWhen asked if one of the key goals of Anthropic\u2019s Economic Futures Program was to research ways to mitigate AI-related job loss, Heck was cautious, noting that the disruptive shifts AI will bring could be \u201cboth good and bad.\u201d\n\u201cI think the key goal is to figure out what is actually happening,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there is job loss, then we should convene a collective group of thinkers to talk about mitigation. If there will be huge GDP expansion, great. We should also convene policy makers to figure out what to do with that. I don\u2019t think any of this will be a monolith.\u201d\nThe program builds on Anthropic\u2019s existing Economic Index, launched in February, which open-sources aggregated, anonymized data to analyze the effects of AI on labor markets and the economy over time \u2013 data that many of its competitors lock behind corporate walls.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe program will focus on three main areas: providing grants to researchers investigating AI\u2019s effect on labor, productivity, and value creation; creating forums to develop and evaluate policy proposals to prepare for AI\u2019s economic impacts; and building datasets to track AI\u2019s economic usage and impact.\nAnthropic is kicking off the program with some action items.\nThe company has opened applications for its rapid grants of up to $50,000 for \u201cempirical research on AI\u2019s economic impacts,\u201d as well as evidence-based policy proposals for Anthropic-hosted symposia events in Washington, D.C. and Europe in the fall. Anthropic is also seeking partnerships with independent research institutions and will provide partners with Claude API credits and other resources to support research.\nFor the grants, Heck noted that Anthropic is looking for individuals, academics, or teams that can come up with high-quality data in a short period of time.\n\u201cWe want to be able to complete it within six months,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be peer-reviewed.\u201d\nFor the symposia, Anthropic wants policy ideas from a wide variety of backgrounds and intellectual perspectives, said Heck. She noted that policy proposals would go \u201cbeyond labor.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to understand more about the transitions,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do workflows happen in new ways? How are new jobs being created that nobody ever contemplated before?\u2026How are certain skills remaining valuable while others are not?\u201d\nHeck said Anthropic also hopes to study the effects of AI on fiscal policy. For example, what happens if there\u2019s a major shift in the way enterprises see value creation?\n\u201cWe really want to open the aperture here on things that can be studied,\u201d Heck said. \u201cLabor is certainly one of them, but it\u2019s a much broader swath.\u201d\nAnthropic rival OpenAI released its own Economic Blueprint in January, which focuses more on helping the public adopt AI tools, building robust AI infrastructure and establishing \u201cAI economic zones\u201d that streamline regulations to promote investment. While OpenAI\u2019s Stargate project to build data centers across the U.S. in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank would create thousands of construction jobs, OpenAI doesn\u2019t directly address AI-related job loss in its economic blueprint.\nOpenAI\u2019s blueprint does, however, outline frameworks where government could play a role in supply chain training pipelines, investing in AI literacy, supporting regional training programs, and scaling public university access to compute to foster local AI-literate workforces.\nAnthropic\u2019s economic impact program is part of a slow but growing shift among some tech companies to position themselves as part of the solution to the disruption they\u2019re helping to create \u2013 whether out of reputational concern, genuine altruism, or a mix of both. For instance, on Thursday, ride-hail company Lyft launched a forum to gather input from human drivers as it starts integrating robotaxis into its platform.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta is offering multimillion-dollar pay for AI researchers, but not $100M 'signing bonuses'\ndescription2:\nMeta is definitely offering hefty multimillion-dollar pay packages to AI researchers when wooing them to its new superintelligence lab. But no one is really getting a $100 million \u201csigning bonus,\u201d according to a poached researcher and comments from a leaked internal meeting.\nDuring a company-wide all-hands meeting on Thursday leaked to The Verge, some of Meta\u2019s top executives were asked about the bonuses that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Meta had offered to top researchers.\nMeta\u2019s CTO Andrew Bosworth implied that only a few people for very senior leadership roles may have been offered that kind of money, but clarified \u201cthe actual terms of the offer\u201d wasn\u2019t a \u201csign-on bonus. It\u2019s all these different things.\u201d In other words, not an instant chunk of cash. Tech companies typically offer the biggest chunks of their pay to senior leaders in restricted stock unit (RSU) grants, dependent on either tenure or performance metrics.\nA four-year total pay package worth about $100 million for a very senior leader is not inconceivable for Meta. Most of Meta\u2019s named officers, including Bosworth, have earned total compensation of between $20 million and nearly $24 million per year for years.\nAltman was \u201csuggesting that we\u2019re doing this for every single person,\u201d Bosworth reportedly said at the meeting. \u201cLook, you guys, the market\u2019s hot. It\u2019s not that hot.\u201d (Meta did not immediately respond to our request for comment.)\nOn Thursday, researcher Lucas Beyer confirmed he was leaving OpenAI to join Meta along with the two others who led OpenAI\u2019s Zurich office. He tweeted: \u201c1) yes, we will be joining Meta. 2) no, we did not get 100M sign-on, that\u2019s fake news.\u201d (Beyer politely declined to comment further on his new role to TechCrunch.)\nBeyer\u2019s expertise is in computer vision AI. That aligns with what Meta is pursuing: entertainment AI, rather than productivity AI, Bosworth reportedly said in that meeting. Meta already has a stake in the ground in that area with its Quest VR headsets and its Ray-Ban and Oakley AI glasses.\nStill, some of the people Meta is trying to nab are indeed worthy of big pay packages in this tight AI talent marketplace. As TechCrunch was first to report, Meta has hired OpenAI\u2019s Trapit Bansal, known for his groundbreaking work on AI reasoning models. He had worked at OpenAI since 2022.\nCertainly, Scale co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is getting a healthy chunk of cash, likely more than $100 million, as part of Meta\u2019s deal to buy 49% ownership of his company. As we previously reported, the $14 billion Meta is paying is being distributed to shareholders as a cash dividend. Wang is almost certainly a major shareholder in Scale entitled to those dividends.\nStill, while Meta isn\u2019t handing out $100 million willy-nilly, it is still spending big to hire in AI.\nOne investor told TechCrunch that he saw an AI researcher get \u2014 and turn down \u2014 an $18 million job offer from Meta. That person took a smaller, but still healthy offer, from a buzzier AI startup: Mira Murati\u2019s Thinking Machines Lab.\n\ntitle3:\nProlific cybercrime gang now targeting airlines and the transportation sector\ndescription3:\nCybersecurity firms are warning that the prolific hacking group known as Scattered Spider is now targeting airlines and the transportation sector.\nExecutives from Google\u2019s cybersecurity unit Mandiant and Palo Alto Networks\u2019 security research division Unit 42 say they have observed cyberattacks targeting the aviation industry resembling Scattered Spider.\nScattered Spider is a collective of mostly English-speaking hackers, typically teenagers and young adults, who are financially motivated to steal and extort sensitive data from company networks. The hackers are also known for their deception tactics, which often rely on social engineering, phishing, and sometimes threats of violence toward company help desks and call centers to gain access to their networks.\nThe warning comes as at least two airlines have reported intrusions this month.\nHawaiian Airlines said late Thursday that it was working to secure its systems following a cyberattack. Canada\u2019s second largest airline, WestJet, reported a cyberattack on June 13 that remains ongoing and unresolved. Media reports have linked the WestJet incident to Scattered Spider.\nThis fresh wave of Scattered Spider attacks comes soon after the cybercriminal gang targeted the U.K. retail sector and the insurance industry. The hackers have previously broken into hotel chains, casinos, and technology giants.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta in talks to acquire voice-cloning startup Play AI\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAlongside bolstering its AI research talent pool, Meta seems to be keen to flesh out its consumer-facing AI features. The company is in discussions to acquire a voice-cloning startup called Play AI, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.\nThe tech giant aims to buy the startup\u2019s tech and bring on board some of its staff, the report said.\nPlay AI lets anyone clone different kinds of voices that they can use for AI-powered use cases, such as customer service, per its website. The startup has raised $23.5 million in total, and its investors include 500 Global, Kindred Ventures, Race Capital, and Soma Capital, per Crunchbase.\nMeta currently lets creators on its social platforms build their own chatbots and has added video-editing capabilities to its Meta AI chatbot. Acquiring a voice startup would let the company bake in audio features into its creative suite.\nMeta declined to comment on the story. Play AI did not immediately return a request for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
