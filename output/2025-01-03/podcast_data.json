Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The tech giant\u2019s 2025 fiscal year ends in June.\n\u201cAs we look into the future, it\u2019s clear that artificial intelligence is poised to become a world-changing GPT. AI promises to drive innovation and boost productivity in every sector of the economy,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThe United States is poised to stand at the forefront of this new technology wave, especially if it doubles down on its strengths and effectively partners internationally.\u201d\nMicrosoft and OpenAI were reportedly in talks in April regarding the construction of a data center facility that would contain an AI supercomputer dubbed Stargate. The facility was estimated to cost over $100 billion to build. Notably, later in the year, Microsoft called the startup a \u201ccompetitor\u201d for the first time in an SEC filing.\nAI\u2019s insatiable thirst for electricity is expected to surge in the coming years, potentially leading to power shortages for data centers.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla reports first-ever drop in annual deliveries\ndescription1:\nTesla posted its fourth-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Thursday. Here are the key numbers:\nTotal deliveries Q4 2024: 495,570\nTotal production Q4 2024: 459,445\nTotal annual deliveries 2024: 1,789,226\nTotal annual production 2024: 1,773,443\nResults for the quarter represented the first annual drop in delivery numbers for Tesla, which reported 1.81 million deliveries in 2023. It reported 484,507 deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTesla shares fell by as much as 7% in trading on Thursday before rebounding on Friday.\nAnalysts had expected Tesla to report deliveries in the quarter of 504,770, including 474,000 Model 3 and Model Y EVs, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by StreetAccount. Tesla sent some investors a company-compiled delivery consensus of 506,763 vehicles, based on a survey of 26 analysts. A widely followed independent Tesla researcher, who publishes as Troy Teslike, predicted deliveries of 501,000.\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\nThe fourth-quarter report comes after a huge late-year rally in Tesla's stock, which finished 2024 up 63%. In mid-December, the shares reached a record, eclipsing their prior all-time high from 2021.\nIt was a big turnaround from the first quarter, when the stock plummeted 29%, its worst period since 2022, as the company contended with declining sales despite price cuts and incentives for buyers. On the company's first-quarter earnings call in April, CEO Elon Musk told investors that while he expected \"higher sales this year than last year,\" the growth rate would slow from 38% in 2023.\nThe biggest story at Tesla in the back half of the year was Musk's role in President-elect Donald Trump's election campaign. Musk, the world's richest person, poured in around $277 million to promote Trump and other Republican candidates, and spent weeks on the road campaigning in swing states.\n\ntitle2:\nGenerative AI funding reached new heights in 2024\ndescription2:\nIf there was any doubt, the generative AI bubble did not burst in 2024.\nInvestments in generative AI, which encompasses a range of AI-powered apps, tools, and services to generate text, images, videos, speech, music, and more, reached new heights last year. According to data from financial tracker PitchBook compiled for TechCrunch, generative AI companies worldwide raised $56 billion from VCs in 2024 across 885 deals.\nThat raw cash total is a new record for the segment. It\u2019s up 192% from 2023, when investors poured $29.1 billion into generative AI startups across 691 deals.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t seeing a slowdown in generative AI funding, as big names like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI continue to secure major raises and release new, competitive products,\u201d said Ali Javaheri, an emerging technology analyst at PitchBook, in an interview.\nDeal value in Q4 2024 soared to $31.1 billion with the closure of mammoth rounds like Databricks\u2019 $10 billion Series J, xAI\u2019s $6 billion Series C, Anthropic\u2019s $4 billion strategic investment from Amazon, and OpenAI\u2019s $6.6 billion round.\nMergers and acquisitions were a small share of generative AI investments in 2024: $951 million, per PitchBook data. To be clear, that\u2019s exclusive of the various \u201cacqui-hire\u201d deals executed by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. Google reportedly paid $2.7 billion to hire much of chatbot startup Character AI\u2018s staff and license its technology, while Microsoft is said to have spent $650 million licensing Inflection\u2018s AI models and hiring its CEO, Mustafa Suleyman.\nU.S. companies attracted the bulk of generative AI backing last year. Startups outside the U.S. nabbed just $6.2 billion of all 2024 VC investments in the market. There were some big winners, however, like Beijing-based Moonshot AI ($1 billion in February), French startup Mistral (~$640 million in June), Cologne-based company DeepL ($300 million in May), Shanghainese firm MiniMax ($600 million in March), and Tokyo-based Sakana AI (~$214 million in September).\nSo what might 2025 hold?\nJavaheri believes that the generative AI sector risks becoming oversaturated with startups in exceedingly similar (or even identical) verticals. To his point, no fewer than four companies developing AI coding assistants \u2014 Augment, Magic, Codeium, and Poolside \u2014 closed rounds exceeding $100 million last year. And a host of generative media startups (e.g., Black Forest Labs, ElevenLabs) have recently secured tens of millions of dollars in funding at sky-high valuations.\nThe trend may not be sustainable as investor pressure to show appreciable revenue growth increases.\nAccording to Javaheri, technical challenges and the vast computing costs needed to stay competitive may pose additional challenges for generative AI ventures. \u201cOnly the best-funded startups can continue to keep up with the pace needed for the most innovative models,\u201d he added. \u201cMost of the high valuations are thus going to come from the infrastructure layer.\u201d\nThat is, of course, very good news for \u201cinfrastructure layer\u201d generative AI players, which did quite well for themselves in 2024. Data center startups like Crusoe ($600 million in December) and Lambda ($320 million in February) represented some of the generative AI market\u2019s largest rounds.\nInvestment firm KKR predicts that soaring demand for data centers to support AI will boost global spending in the sector to $250 billion a year.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Offers also include discounts for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15.\nFor a long time Apple has resisted offering discounts through its own retail channels. Instead, third-party retailers would offer deals at certain times of the year. However, as competition ramps up, Apple has been more inclined in the last year to post seasonal deals.\nApple offered a similar Lunar New Year deal last year and in May, the company offered hefty discounts as part of China's 618 shopping festival.\"\n\nResponse:",
