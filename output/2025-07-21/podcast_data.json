Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

About 330 million of those are coming from users in the U.S.\nThese numbers show just how ubiquitous OpenAI\u2019s flagship product is becoming.\nGoogle\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, does not release daily search data, but recently revealed that Google receives 5 trillion queries per year, which averages to just under 14 billion daily searches. Independent researchers have found similar trends. Neil Patel of NP Digital estimates that Google receives 13.7 billion searches daily, while research from SparkToro and Datos \u2014 two digital marketing companies \u2014 estimates that the figure is around 16.4 billion per day.\nStill, ChatGPT has shown impressively rapid growth. In December, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that users send over 1 billion queries to ChatGPT each day. At Altman\u2019s word, the company\u2019s search volume has more than doubled in around eight months.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI and Google outdo the mathletes, but not each other\ndescription1:\nAI models from OpenAI and Google DeepMind achieved gold-medal scores in the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO), one of the world\u2019s oldest and most challenging high school-level math competitions, the companies independently announced in recent days.\nThe results underscore just how fast AI systems are advancing, and yet, how evenly matched Google and OpenAI seem to be in the AI race. AI companies are competing fiercely for the public perception of being ahead in the AI race: an intangible battle of \u201cvibes\u201d that can have big implications for securing top AI talent. A lot of AI researchers come from backgrounds in competitive math, so benchmarks like IMO mean more than others.\nLast year, Google scored a silver medal at IMO using a \u201cformal\u201d system, meaning it required humans to translate problems into a machine\u2011readable format. This year, both OpenAI and Google entered \u201cinformal\u201d systems into the competition, which were able to ingest questions and generate proof\u2011based answers in natural language. Both companies claim their AI models correctly answered five out of six questions on IMO\u2019s test, scoring higher than most high school students and Google\u2019s AI model from last year, without requiring any human-machine translation.\nIn interviews with TechCrunch, researchers behind OpenAI and Google\u2019s IMO efforts claimed that these gold-medal performances represent breakthroughs around AI reasoning models in non-verifiable domains. While AI reasoning models tend to do well on questions with straightforward answers, such as simple math or coding tasks, these systems struggle on tasks with more ambiguous solutions, such as buying a great chair or helping with complex research.\nHowever, Google is raising questions around how OpenAI conducted and announced its gold-medal IMO performance. After all, if you\u2019re going to enter AI models into a math contest for high schoolers, you might as well argue like teenagers.\nShortly after OpenAI announced its feat on Saturday morning, Google DeepMind\u2019s CEO and researchers took to social media to slam OpenAI for announcing its gold medal prematurely \u2014 shortly after IMO announced which high schoolers had won the competition on Friday night \u2014 and for not having their model\u2019s test officially evaluated by IMO.\nBtw as an aside, we didn\u2019t announce on Friday because we respected the IMO Board's original request that all AI labs share their results only after the official results had been verified by independent experts & the students had rightly received the acclamation they deserved \u2014 Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) July 21, 2025\nThang Luong, a Google DeepMind senior researcher and lead for the IMO project, told TechCrunch that Google waited to announce its IMO results to respect the students participating in the competition.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nLuong said that Google has been working with IMO\u2019s organizers since last year in preparation for the test and wanted to have the IMO president\u2019s blessing and official grading before announcing its official results, which it did on Monday morning.\n\u201cThe IMO organizers have their grading guideline,\u201d Luong said. \u201cSo any evaluation that\u2019s not based on that guideline could not make any claim about gold-medal level [performance].\u201d\nNoam Brown, a senior OpenAI researcher who worked on the IMO model, told TechCrunch that IMO reached out to OpenAI a few months ago about participating in a formal math competition, but the ChatGPT-maker declined because it was working on natural language systems that it thought were more worth pursuing. Brown says OpenAI didn\u2019t know IMO was conducting an informal test with Google.\nOpenAI says it hired third-party evaluators \u2014 three former IMO medalists who understood the grading system \u2014 to grade its AI model\u2019s performance. After OpenAI learned of its gold-medal score, Brown said the company reached out to IMO, which then told the company to wait to announce until after IMO\u2019s Friday night award ceremony.\nIMO did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nGoogle isn\u2019t necessarily wrong here \u2014 it did go through a more official, rigorous process to achieve its gold-medal score \u2014 but the debate may miss the bigger picture: AI models from several leading AI labs are improving quickly. Countries from around the world sent their brightest students to compete at IMO this year, and just a few percent of them scored as well as OpenAI and Google\u2019s AI models did.\nWhile OpenAI used to have a significant lead over the industry, it certainly feels as though the race is more closely matched than any company would like to admit. OpenAI is expected to release GPT-5 in the coming months, and the company certainly hopes to give off the impression that it still leads the AI industry.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla's retro-futuristic diner officially opens as Elon Musk hints at more locations\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nThe Tesla Diner & Drive-In, a long-awaited and hyped facility that combines retro nostalgia and futurism with the automaker\u2019s fast-charging network, officially opened at 4:20 p.m. Monday in Hollywood, California.\nThe Tesla Diner & Drive-In is technically a place for Tesla drivers to charge their EVs and maybe get hamburger, hot dog, or other classic diner menu items (which Eater shared in full). The diner, which per reporting from Not a Tesla App is loaded with Tesla-branded merchandise, an Optimus robot, and two 45-foot LED movie screens, is clearly hoping to attract more than just Tesla owners.\nIt\u2019s too early to tell if the diner, which boasts 80 v4 Superchargers stalls and a drive-in movie theater that syncs with speakers inside a driver\u2019s Tesla, will become an enduring fixture of Hollywood. The long lines of people who queued up Monday morning suggests the diner will attract crowds for awhile.\nEven before its doors officially opened, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mused about establishing more of the diners globally.\n\u201cIf our retro-futuristic diner turns out well, which I think it will, @Tesla will establish these in major cities around the world, as well as at Supercharger sites on long distance routes,\u201d Musk posted on X.\n\ntitle3:\nHackers exploiting SharePoint zero-day seen targeting government agencies\ndescription3:\nThe hackers behind the initial wave of attacks exploiting a zero-day in Microsoft SharePoint servers have so far primarily targeted government organizations, according to researchers and news reports.\nOver the weekend, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA published an alert, warning that hackers were exploiting a previously unknown bug \u2014 known as a \u201czero-day\u201d \u2014 in Microsoft\u2019s enterprise data management product SharePoint. While it\u2019s still too early to draw definitive conclusions, it appears that the hackers who first started abusing this flaw were targeting government organizations, according to Silas Cutler, the principal researcher at Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities on the internet.\n\u201cIt looks like initial exploitation was against a narrow set of targets,\u201d Cutler told TechCrunch. \u201cLikely government related.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a fairly rapidly evolving case. Initial exploitation of this vulnerability was likely fairly limited in terms of targeting, but as more attackers learn to replicate exploitation, we will likely see breaches as a result of this incident,\u201d said Cutler.\nContact Us Do you have more information about these SharePoint attacks? We\u2019d love to hear from you. From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you have more information about these SharePoint attacks?

From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email .\nNow that the vulnerability is out there, and is still not fully patched by Microsoft, it\u2019s possible other hackers that are not necessarily working for a government will join in and start abusing it, Cutler said.\nCutler added that he and his colleagues are seeing between 9,000 and 10,000 vulnerable SharePoint instances accessible from the internet, but that could change. Eye Security, which first published the existence of the bug, reported seeing a similar number, saying its researchers scanned more than 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and found evidence of dozens of compromised servers.\nGiven the limited number of targets and the types of targets at the beginning of the campaign, Cutler explained, it is likely that the hackers were part of a government group, commonly known as an advanced persistent threat.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe Washington Post reported on Sunday that the attacks targeted U.S. federal and state agencies, as well as universities and energy companies, among other commercial targets.\nMicrosoft said in a blog post that the vulnerability only affects versions of SharePoint that are installed on local networks, and not the cloud versions, which means that each organization that deploys a SharePoint server needs to apply the patch or disconnect it from the internet.\n\ntitle4:\nFigma\u2019s Dylan Field will cash out about $60M in IPO, with Index, Kleiner, Greylock, Sequoia all selling, too\ndescription4:\nWhen Figma announced its initial hoped-for price range on Monday ($25-$28), it also revealed an unusual decision for its highly anticipated IPO.\nIt will allow existing shareholders to sell more shares than the company plans to sell, by a high ratio. The company plans to offer about 12.5 million shares. Yet existing shareholders will be allowed to cash out of nearly 24.7 million shares, it said.\nIn addition, should this IPO be as hot as everyone thinks it will be, existing shareholders will get the option to sell, collectively, up to 5.5 million more shares.\nFigma founder CEO Dylan Field has disclosed that he plans to sell 2.35 million shares. At the midrange he\u2019ll be cashing out of over $62 million. (That might be a much higher number if the IPO prices above $28, too.)\nEven with that sale, he will still own an enormous number of shares and control the company. He will hold 74% of the voting rights after the IPO. This is thanks to supervoting rights of 15 votes per share for the Class B stock he controls, plus the right to vote the Class B shares of his co-founder, Evan Wallace, the company says in its S-1.\nFigma\u2019s biggest venture investors are all cashing out some shares, as well, including Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. Should the demand be there for the over-allotment, they will cash out 1.7 million to 3.3 million shares apiece. That should allow them to return some cash to their investors in this liquidity-starved venture market.\nIt should be noted, though, that each of these investors is keeping the lion\u2019s share of their Figma holdings. One way to interpret this largely secondary sale is that if the company hadn\u2019t opened up share sales to existing investors, it might not have had enough shares to meet the demand.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

But should it price above its announced range (as often happens with hot IPOs), Figma will raise more, as will its shareholders.\nPrior to pricing, IPO experts expected Figma to sell around $1.5 billion worth of stock. Should it price above range and exceed that, Figma would be the biggest IPO of 2025 to date. The IPO could happen next week, so we shall soon see. Figma declined further comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
