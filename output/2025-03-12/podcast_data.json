Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday March 13), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAnthropic CEO says spies are after $100M AI secrets in a \u2018few lines of code\u2019\ndescription0:\nAnthropic\u2019s CEO Dario Amodei is worried that spies, likely from China, are getting their hands on costly \u201calgorithmic secrets\u201d from the U.S.\u2019s top AI companies \u2014 and he wants the U.S. government to step in.\nSpeaking at a Council on Foreign Relations event on Monday, Amodei said that China is known for its \u201clarge-scale industrial espionage\u201d and that AI companies like Anthropic are almost certainly being targeted.\n\u201cMany of these algorithmic secrets, there are $100 million secrets that are a few lines of code,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, I\u2019m sure that there are folks trying to steal them, and they may be succeeding.\u201d\nMore help from the U.S. government to defend against this risk is \u201cvery important,\u201d Amodei added, without specifying exactly what kind of help would be required.\nAnthropic declined to comment to TechCrunch on the remarks specifically but referred to Anthropic\u2019s recommendations to the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) earlier this month.\nIn the submission, Anthropic argues that the federal government should partner with AI industry leaders to beef up security at frontier AI labs, including by working with U.S. intelligence agencies and their allies.\nThe remarks are in keeping with Amodei\u2019s more critical stance toward Chinese AI development. Amodei has called for strong U.S. export controls on AI chips to China while saying that DeepSeek scored \u201cthe worst\u201d on a critical bioweapons data safety test that Anthropic ran.\nAmodei\u2019s concerns, as he laid out in his essay \u201cMachines of Loving Grace\u201d and elsewhere, center on China using AI for authoritarian and military purposes.\nThis kind of stance has led to criticism from some in the AI community who argue the U.S. and China should collaborate more, not less, on AI, in order to avoid an arms race that results in either country building a system so powerful that humans can\u2019t control it.\n\ntitle1:\nIntel appoints Lip-Bu Tan as its next CEO\ndescription1:\nIntel has appointed Lip-Bu Tan, a major figure in the semiconductor industry, as CEO, the company announced late Wednesday.\nTan succeeds interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus. He\u2019ll also rejoin the Intel board of directors after stepping down from the board in August 2024, Intel said. Zinsner will remain Intel\u2019s CFO, while Johnston Holthaus will remain CEO of the company\u2019s Intel Products division.\nTan, a Malaysia-born, longtime tech investor, formerly served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems. He was a manager at two energy firms, EDS Nuclear and ECHO Energy, and a partner at the Walden USA investment fund before founding venture capital firm Walden International in 1987.\nTan is exceptionally well-connected in the tech industry, and a director on the boards of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Schneider Electric, and SoftBank. He\u2019s also widely respected as a business leader. After Intel announced Tan\u2019s appointment, the company\u2019s stock jumped around 11% in after-hours trading.\nIn a statement, Tan said that Intel will be an \u201cengineering-focused company\u201d under his leadership.\n\u201cWe will push ourselves to develop the best products, listen intently to our customers, and hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we make so that we build trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also have a responsibility to deliver for our shareholders \u2014 something I am equally focused on and expect will be an outcome of our renewed focus on customers.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle DeepMind unveils new AI models for controlling robots\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nGoogle DeepMind, Google\u2019s AI research lab, on Wednesday announced new AI models called Gemini Robotics designed to enable real-world machines to interact with objects, navigate environments, and more.\nDeepMind published a series of demo videos showing robots equipped with Gemini Robotics folding paper, putting a pair of glasses into a case, and other tasks in response to voice commands. According to the lab, Gemini Robotics was trained to generalize behavior across a range of different robotics hardware, and to connect items robots can \u201csee\u201d with actions they might take.\nDeepMind claims that in tests, Gemini Robotics allowed robots to perform well in environments not included in the training data. The lab has released a slimmed-down model, Gemini Robotics-ER, that researchers can use to train their own models for robotics control, as well as a benchmark called Asimov for gauging risks with AI-powered robots.\n\ntitle3:\nHow to watch Nvidia GTC 2025, including CEO Jensen Huang's keynote\ndescription3:\nGTC, Nvidia\u2019s biggest conference of the year, will return starting Monday in San Jose. If you can\u2019t make it in person, don\u2019t sweat it. TechCrunch will be on the ground covering the major developments.\nMany of the biggest presentations, talks, and panels will be livestreamed as well. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to deliver a keynote from the SAP Center on Tuesday at 10 a.m. PT, which you\u2019ll be able to stream and watch online at Nvidia.com without having to register and on Nvidia\u2019s YouTube channel.\nWe\u2019re expecting Huang to reveal more about Nvidia\u2019s next flagship GPU series, Blackwell Ultra, and the next-gen Rubin chip architecture. Also likely on the agenda: automotive, robotics, and lots and lots of AI updates.\nNvidia.com is also where you\u2019ll find a catalog of all the virtual and on-demand sessions at GTC, including workshops on efficient large language model customization, conversations on generative AI for core banking, and demos of datasets for specialized domains like biology.\n\ntitle4:\nFood delivery startup Wonder acquires media company Tastemade for $90M\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nFood delivery startup Wonder is acquiring media company Tastemade for around $90 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Founded in 2012, Tastemade produces food, travel, and home videos and operates several free, ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels.\nThe acquisition gives Wonder access to a content studio, production company, and advertising business. Wonder will leverage all of these assets to promote its brands to a wider audience, the company says.\nThe deal marks Wonder\u2019s latest step toward its mission to create a mealtime \u201csuper app.\u201d Wonder founder and CEO Marc Lore, who was previously Walmart\u2019s head of e-commerce, wants to turn Wonder into an AI app that not only tells you what to eat but also automatically orders it for you from Wonder kitchens.\nWith this acquisition, users may soon be able to place a delivery order for a dish that they\u2019re seeing being prepared by a chef on a Tastemade streaming channel.\nWonder\u2019s past acquisitions include Blue Apron and Grubhub. The startup has raised a total of $1.6 billion to date.\"\n\nResponse:",
