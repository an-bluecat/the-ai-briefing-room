However, high-net-worth individuals with accounts at the brokerage Raymond James and Associates could also invest in Coatue, per the report.\nCoatue, which has nearly $50 billion in assets under management, has invested in over 170 VC-backed companies in 2021, according to PitchBook data. Coatue has since drastically slowed its startup investing pace, backing only 81 companies in 2022 and about 30 companies in 2023.\nThe crossover investor isn\u2019t done with investing in private companies, however. So far in 2024, Coatue has backed 29 startups, PitchBook data shows. The firm\u2019s latest AI-focused investments include Glean, Scale AI and Skild AI, which is building a general-purpose AI robot. Philippe Laffont, Coatue\u2019s founder (pictured above) has said he is particularly excited about humanoid robots with AI-powered brains.\n\ntitle1:\nPerplexity CEO offers AI company's services to replace striking NYT staff\ndescription1:\nThe CEO of AI search company Perplexity, Aravind Srinivas, has offered to cross picket lines and provide services to mitigate the effect of a strike by New York Times tech workers.\nThe NYT Tech Guild announced its strike Monday, after setting November 4 as its deadline months earlier. The workers represented provide software support and data analysis for the Times, on the business side of the outlet. They have been asking for an annual 2.5% wage increase and to cement a current two days per week in-office expectation, among other things.\n\u201cBut the company has decided that our members aren\u2019t worth enough to agree to a fair contract and stop committing unfair labor practices,\u201d the guild wrote on X.\n\u201cThey have left us no choice but to demonstrate the power of our labor on the picket line,\u201d said Kathy Zhang, the organization\u2019s unit chair, in a statement.\nThe NYT\u2019s publisher, AG Sulzberger, criticized a strike two days ahead of the U.S. presidential election, saying in a statement, \u201cHundreds of millions of people are depending on The Times\u2019s journalism on Election Day and afterward, and it is troubling that the Tech Guild would try to block this public service at such a consequential moment for our country.\u201d\nPicketers demonstrated in front of the NYT building in New York as negotiations continued. Meanwhile, on X, formerly known as Twitter, Perplexity\u2019s CEO offered to step in for the striking workers.\nReplying to Semafor media editor Max Tani quoting the publisher, Srinivas wrote: \u201cHey AG Sulzberger @nytimes sorry to see this. Perplexity is on standby to help ensure your essential coverage is available to all through the election. DM me anytime here.\u201d\nMany on X immediately castigated Srinivas for acting as a scab \u2014 a derogatory term for people willing to perform the jobs of striking workers. It is widely considered a disreputable behavior in matters of labor and equity. By undercutting collective action, scabs limit the ability of workers to bargain with those in positions of power.\nSrinivas may simply be trying to make sure people have the information they need on election day. The company has lately unveiled its own elections info hub and map. But to offer its services explicitly as a replacement for striking workers was bound to be an unpopular move.\nThough TechCrunch asked Perplexity for comment, Srinivas responded to TechCrunch\u2019s post on X saying that \u201cthe offer was *not* to \u2018replace\u2019 journalists or engineers with AI but to provide technical infra support on a high-traffic day.\u201d The striking workers in question, however, are the ones who provide that service to the NYT. It\u2019s not really clear what services other than AI tools Perplexity could offer, or why they would not amount to replacing the workers in question. (However, in response to the clarification, we have opted to change the headline to reflect the claim that this offer was not necessarily specific to AI services.)\nThe NYT and Perplexity aren\u2019t exactly on the best of terms right now. The Times sent Perplexity a cease and desist letter in October over the startup\u2019s scraping of articles for use by its AI models. In a conversation last week with TechCrunch, the normally outspoken CEO declined to define \u201cplagiarism.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon brings generative AI-powered recaps to Prime Video\ndescription2:\nInstead of scouring the internet for a summary of a TV show, which often risks unintentionally revealing major plot points, Prime Video\u2019s latest feature aims to save viewers from encountering any spoilers.\nAmazon announced on Monday the launch of \u201cX-Ray Recaps,\u201d a generative AI-powered feature that creates concise summaries of entire seasons, single episodes, and even parts of episodes. Notably, the company claims that guardrails were put in place to ensure the AI doesn\u2019t generate spoilers, so you can fully enjoy your favorite series without the anxiety of stumbling upon unwanted information.\nThe new feature is an expansion of the streamers\u2019 existing X-Ray feature, which displays information when you pause the screen, such as details about the cast and other trivia.\nTo use Recaps, visit the detail page of a TV show, where a new rewind icon will allow you to select from three choices: recap the current episode, recap the entire season so far, or recap the previous season.\nX-Ray Recaps is currently in beta and will only be available to Fire TV customers in the U.S. to start. At launch, users can access the feature on all Amazon MGM Studios original titles, including \u201cDaisy Jones & the Six,\u201d \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith,\u201d \u201cThe Wheel of Time,\u201d and \u201cThe Boys.\u201d\nIt\u2019ll roll out to additional devices at the end of the year.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nAs the company explained in its blog post, the feature leverages a combination of custom AI models (built with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker) to analyze video, subtitles, and dialogue to describe key events, conversations, and other information.\nAmazon also noted that the feature is fully personalized to align with the precise moment you\u2019re watching. So, whether you\u2019re just a few minutes into a new episode, midway through a season, or returning to a series you forgot about, X-Ray Recaps can provide brief snippets of scenes happening in real time.\nPrime Video\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of rival Google TV releasing AI-generated summaries, a similar tool that creates brief synopses of TV shows and movies.\n\ntitle3:\nHow Big Tech intends to power AI's thirst for energy\ndescription3:\nIndustrial chiller at Yotta Data Services Pvt. data center, in Navi Mumbai, India, on Thursday, Mar. 14, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nA huge upswing in the number of data centers worldwide shows no signs of slowing down, prompting Big Tech to consider how best to power the artificial intelligence revolution. Some of the options on the table include a pivot to nuclear, liquid cooling for data centers and quantum computing. Critics, however, have said that as the pace of efficiency gains in electricity use slows, tech giants should recognize the cost of the generative AI boom across the whole supply chain \u2014 and let go of the \"move fast and break things\" narrative. \"The actual environmental cost is quite hidden at the moment. It is just subsidized by the fact that tech companies need to get a product and a buy-in,\" Somya Joshi, head of division: global agendas, climate and systems at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), told CNBC via video call. A wave of data center investment is expected to accelerate even further in the coming years, according to the International Energy Agency, primarily driven by growing digitalization and the uptake of generative AI. It is this prospect that has stoked concerns about an electricity demand surge \u2014 as well as AI's often-overlooked but critically important environmental impact.\nI think in the summer of every great technology we discover there is a winter \u2014 but don't pay attention to it until winter arrives. Raj Hazra CEO of Quantinuum\nData centers, which consume an ever-increasing amount of energy, represent a key piece of infrastructure behind modern-day cloud computing and AI applications. Giampiero Frisio, president of electrification at Swiss multinational ABB, said the engineering group's data center business has enjoyed remarkable growth in recent years \u2014 with the segment on track to grow by more than 24% in 2024. Frisio said ABB has been well placed in the AI demand boom to supply mid-sized and big-name industry players with all the components needed to run a data center. \"I think the best way to act now is to increase the energy efficiency. That's the best way because the technology is there, for example the medium voltage HiPerGuard UPS. You can do it, and you can do it tomorrow morning,\" Frisio told CNBC via video call. The HiPerGuard UPS refers to ABB's industry-first medium voltage uninterruptable power supply, which it says can provide continuous power to large facilities.\nA server room at a data center in India. Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\"The second one is to move on the liquid cooling, there is no doubt. Again, this is in the optic of better energy efficiency. Why? Because a single rack, you know the black boxes that look like a wardrobe with all the servers inside, the power density of those is going to be four to six times than before,\" Frisio said. \"After that, we are talking about five to 10 years from now, it is the nuclear modular system,\" he added.\nBig Tech is going nuclear\nU.S. tech behemoths Microsoft, Google and Amazon have all secured nuclear energy deals worth billions of dollars in recent months as they seek to bring additional energy capacity online to train and run the massive generative AI models behind today's applications. The upsurge of generative AI demand has coincided with a push to find more efficient cooling solutions in data centers, particularly liquid cooling \u2014 a process in which water is used to lower the temperatures of servers and other electronic equipment.\nAerial view of a data center owned by the US multinational and technology company Google in Santiago on October 9, 2024. The drought that is affecting part of South America, coupled with public pressure, is forcing technology giants such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft to reformulate their data center projects in the region in favor of low-water consumption ones. Rodrigo Arangua | Afp | Getty Images\nFrench power-equipment maker Schneider Electric recently completed an $850 million deal to take a controlling stake in Motivair Corp, a U.S.-based company that specializes in liquid cooling for high-performance computing. Schneider Electric CEO's at the time told CNBC that the all-cash deal, which is designed to bolster its offering to data centers, was \"rich, but not overly expensive\" and \"fits great\" with the firm's strategy. Alongside nuclear energy and liquid cooling technology, some tech players have suggested developments within AI could help to decarbonize data centers.\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt, for example, said last month that since \"we're not going to hit the climate goals anyway\", investing in AI could be pivotal to solving some of our biggest environmental challenges. SEI's Joshi flatly rejected this point of view. \"These arguments are not new, they are very much in line with the sort of 'silver bullet', 'tech will save us' rhetoric,\" Joshi said. \"There is something inherently at odds with saying we operate within certain finite planetary boundaries and yet by exceeding them and continuing with the same extractive narratives, we are somehow going to solve the problem that we're in now,\" she added.\nQuantum computing\n\"I think in the summer of every great technology we discover there is a winter \u2014 but don't pay attention to it until winter arrives,\" Raj Hazra, CEO of Quantinuum, the world's largest integrated quantum computing company, told CNBC via video call. \"That is my way of describing what is happening with generative AI, the infrastructure needed to support it [and] the massive data centers that have to be built.\" Hazra said optimism over the generative AI boom is already straining the cost of running the technology. \"As wonderful as AI is, there are two challenges to it. One is, is it sustainable from a resource standpoint? The other is, is it responsible?\" Hazra said. \"The reason I bring up this context is because quantum is critical to both of them.\"\nHalbergman | E+ | Getty Images\n\ntitle4:\nVanguard cuts Indian rideshare startup Ola's valuation to $2B\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nVanguard has revised its valuation of Indian ride-hailing startup Ola to about $2 billion as of the end of August, according to a regulatory filing.\nA U.S. asset manager\u2019s fund disclosed in a filing that it values its holding in ANI Technologies, the parent firm of Ola, at about $14.3 million, compared to some $51 million it spent to acquire those shares.\nThe disclosure implies a valuation of about $2 billion for the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which was valued at $7.3 billion in late 2021. Ola competes with Uber, Swiggy-backed Rapido, and Google-backed Moving Tech in India\u2019s ride-hailing market.\nThe valuation adjustment follows previous cuts by Vanguard, including one in August 2023 that valued the company at about $2.6 billion.\nBhavish Aggarwal co-founded Ola in 2010.
