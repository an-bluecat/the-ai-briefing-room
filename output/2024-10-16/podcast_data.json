The layoffs appear to have hit employees working on Threads, recruiting, legal operations, and design, among other teams, according to social media posts announcing the layoffs seen by TechCrunch.\n\u201cToday, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,\u201d said a Meta spokesperson in an emailed statement. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\u201d\nMeta did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment on how many employees were affected. One former employee impacted by Wednesday\u2019s layoff tells TechCrunch that more than a dozen people on their team were laid off on Wednesday via video calls. Some employees laid off on Wednesday received six weeks of severance pay, according to the former Meta employee. (The employee spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive matter.)\nEmployees working on Reality Labs, Instagram, and WhatsApp were also affected by the layoffs, according to The Verge.\nIn recent years, Meta has laid off a large amount of its workforce to rightsize the company following aggressive pandemic hiring. In 2022, Meta laid off roughly 13% of its workforce, or 11,000 employees, for which CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally took responsibility. In 2023, Meta laid off another 10,000 employees and withdrew 5,000 open roles it had yet to fill.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta is laying off employees at WhatsApp, Instagram, and more\ndescription1:\nMeta has begun laying off employees across various departments, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, according to people familiar with the matter. Rather than a mass, companywide layoff, these smaller cuts seem to coincide with reorganizations of specific teams.\nSome Meta employees have started posting that they\u2019ve been laid off. Among them is Jane Manchun Wong, who gained notoriety for reporting on unannounced features coming to apps before joining the Threads team in 2023.\n\u201cToday, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,\u201d company spokesperson Dave Arnold said in a statement shared with The Verge. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\u201d\nThis new round of layoffs follows a small series of job cuts in the company\u2019s Reality Labs division earlier this year. Meta first laid off 11,000 employees in 2022 following overoptimism about the company\u2019s growth coming out of the covid pandemic. It then announced cuts of 10,000 more people as part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d in 2023.\n\ntitle2:\nASML share plunge wipes over $50 billion off Dutch chip giant's value\ndescription2:\nAn icon of ASML is displayed on a smartphone, with an ASML chip visible in the background.\nShares in semiconductor equipment maker ASML fell 16% on Tuesday, after the Dutch company published financial results a day early, issuing disappointing sales forecasts.\nASML's share plunge led the critical semiconductor firm to lose 48.7 billion euros ($52.99 billion) in market capitalization in a single day, according to CNBC calculations using LSEG data.\nThe move also pulled other chip stocks lower, with Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom all falling after the report.\nNetherlands-based ASML on Tuesday said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.6 billion and $38.1 billion), at the lower half of the range it had previously provided.\nNet bookings for the September quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion), the company said \u2014 well below the 5.6 billion euro LSEG consensus estimate. Net sales, however, beat expectations and reached 7.5 billion euros.\n\"While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover. It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected,\" company CEO Christophe Fouquet said in the earnings release.\n\ntitle3:\nStanley Druckenmiller regrets Nvidia sale after stock tripled in 2023\ndescription3:\nBillionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller said on Wednesday that his decision to sell out of Nvidia this year was a \"big mistake.\"\n\"I've made so many mistakes in my investment career \u2014 one of them was I sold all my Nvidia probably somewhere between $800 and $950,\" Druckenmiller said in an interview on Bloomberg. \"I own none and I owned none the last 400 points.\"\nDruckenmiller's comments do not reflect Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect in June. The stock closed Wednesday at $135.72. On a split-adjusted basis, his sales would have taken place at between $80 and $95.\nNvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, selling its graphics processing units, or GPUs, to top cloud companies and the biggest developers of large language models. The stock soared 239% last year and is up another 174% in 2024, closing at a fresh record on Monday.\nEarlier this year, Druckenmiller revealed on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he cut his Duquesne Family Office's position in Nvidia in late March, saying \"we've had a hell of a run.\"\nTaking the split into account, Duquesne owned about 6.18 million shares at the start of the year, 1.76 million at the end of the first quarter and 214,000 when the second quarter closed. In the third quarter of last year, Nvidia was his top holding. At the time, he owned 8.75 million shares worth around $400 million.\nIf he held onto that entire stake, it would currently be worth about $1.19 billion. Duquesne has not released its third-quarter holdings yet.\n\"It tripled in a year, and I thought the valuation was rich,\" Druckenmiller told Bloomberg. \"Nvidia is a wonderful company and were the price to come down, we'd get involved again. But right now, I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale.\"\nNvidia is expected to release quarterly results in November, but most of its top customers, including Meta , Microsoft , Amazon and Alphabet , will report financials later this month.\nDruckenmiller told CNBC in May that Nvidia was \"a little overhyped now, but underhyped long term.\" He added that he was introduced to Nvidia in 2022, when \"I didn't even know how to spell it.\"\n\ntitle4:\nBig Tech turns to nuclear energy to fuel power-intensive AI ambitions\ndescription4:\nThe OpenAI app icon displayed along with other AI applications on a smartphone. Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto via Getty Images\nTechnology giants are turning to nuclear energy to power the energy-intensive data centers needed to train and run the massive artificial intelligence models behind today's generative AI applications. Microsoft and Google are among the firms agreeing deals to purchase nuclear power from certain suppliers in the U.S. to bring additional energy capacity online for its data centers. This week, Google said it would purchase power from Kairos Power, a developer of small modular reactors, to help \"deliver on the progress of AI.\" \"The grid needs these kinds of clean, reliable sources of energy that can support the build out of these technologies,\" Michael Terrell, senior director for energy and climate at Google, said on a call with reporters Monday. \"We feel like nuclear can play an important role in helping to meet our demand, and helping meet our demand cleanly, in a way that's more around the clock.\"\nwatch now\nGoogle said its first nuclear reactor from Kairos Power would be online by 2030, with more reactors going live through 2035. The tech giant isn't the only firm looking to nuclear power to realize its AI ambitions. Last month, Microsoft signed a deal with U.S. energy firm Constellation to resurrect a defunct reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, whose reactor has been dormant for five years. The Three Mile Island plant was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown and radiation leak in U.S. history in March 1979, when the loss of water coolant through a faulty valve caused a reactor to overheat. Meanwhile, not to be outdone, Amazon announced its own mega investment in nuclear Wednesday a $500 million deal with Dominion Energy to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor near the utility company's North Anna nuclear power station.\nWhy they're turning to nuclear\nTech companies are under pressure to find energy sources to power data centers \u2014 a key piece of infrastructure behind modern-day cloud computing and AI applications. Many developers rent out servers equipped with GPUs (graphics processing units), which would typically be too expensive to own outright, from so-called cloud \"hyperscalers\" \u2014 such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These tech giants have benefited from a surge of interest in generative AI applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. But that increase in demand has also led to an unintended effect: correspondingly large spikes in the amount of energy required.\nwatch now\nGlobal electricity consumption from data centers, artificial intelligence and the cryptocurrency sector is expected to double from an estimated 460 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2022 to more than 1,000 TWh in 2026, according to a research report from the International Energy Agency. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside, published a study in April last year that found ChatGPT consumes 500 milliliters of water for every 10 to 50 prompts, depending on when and where the AI model is deployed. That equates to roughly the amount of water in a standard 16-ounce bottle. As of August, there were more than 200 million people submitting questions on OpenAI's popular chatbot ChatGPT every week, according to OpenAI. That's double the 100 million weekly active users OpenAI reported last November.\nEnvironmental opposition\nNuclear energy isn't without its controversy. Many climate activists oppose such supplies, citing their hazardous environmental and safety risks, and the fact that they do not offer a genuine source of renewable power. \"Nuclear power is incredibly expensive, hazardous and slow to build,\" the climate charity Greenpeace says on its website. \"It is often referred to as 'clean' energy because it doesn't produce carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases when electricity is generated but the reality is that it isn't a plausible alternative to renewable energy sources.\" Proponents of nuclear energy, on the other hand, say that it offers a nearly carbon-free form of electricity and is more reliable than renewable sources like solar and wind.\nwatch now\n\"If it is built and securitized in the right way, I do think nuclear is the future,\" Rosanne Kincaid-Smith, chief operating officer of Northern Data Group, a global data center provider, told CNBC at a tech conference in London last week. \"People are scared of nuclear because of the disasters we've had in the past. But what's coming, I just don't see traditional grids being the sustainable power that's ongoing in the development of AI,\" Kincaid-Smith added. While Northern Data Group isn't using nuclear energy \u2014 nor is it actively exploring plans to use nuclear as a power source for its AI data centers \u2014 the firm does want to \"contribute to that conversation because it's important for the wider ecosystem, the wider economy,\" Kincaid-Smith told CNBC. - CNBC's Pippa Stevens contributed to this report\"\n\nResponse:",
