Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

But CEO Elon Musk is focused on building a \u201crobot army\u201d and making good on his years-long, unfulfilled promise of self-driving cars \u2014 tasks he needs to accomplish if he is to unlock the full value of the $1 trillion compensation package that Tesla wants to award him.\nThe tension between Tesla\u2019s current automotive-driven business and the AI-centric one that Musk is aiming for has never been more clear.\nTesla delivered a record number of vehicles in the third quarter of 2025, thanks in large part to a rush of customers in the United States who took advantage of the expiring federal EV tax credit. But that record quarter did not lead to greater earnings. In fact, Tesla\u2019s third-quarter profit was still 37% lower than it was in the same quarter last year.\nTesla shipped 497,099 cars in the third quarter, which generated $21.2 billion in automotive revenue \u2014 the company\u2019s best revenue figure in more than a year. But Tesla only pulled in a profit of $1.4 billion, up just $200 million from the second quarter of this year, according to a shareholder letter released Wednesday. The record quarter came after an abysmal start to the year for Tesla, which saw sales drop mightily in part because of Musk\u2019s involvement with the Trump administration.\nThe company explained in the letter that a big increase in operating expenses \u2014 50% higher compared to the third quarter last year \u2014 was one of the culprits. That operating expense bump was thanks to spending on AI and other R&D projects, as well as \u201crestructuring\u201d charges of nearly $240 million. Tesla didn\u2019t explain what those restructuring charges were for, but it\u2019s possibly related to the recent decision to shut down the company\u2019s six-year-old Dojo supercomputer project.\nTesla cited tariffs as another drag on profits this past quarter, meaning Musk spent around $300 million to help elect a president who has hurt the company\u2019s business. Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said on a conference call Wednesday the tariff hit was about $400 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a critical inflection point for Tesla and our strategy going forward as we bring AI into the real world,\u201d Musk said on the call. Tesla is at the \u201cbeginning of scaling, quite massively, Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport,\u201d he said.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAll of this will put even more pressure on the company\u2019s final quarter of the year.\nTesla already needs another record quarter (and then some) if it wants to simply match the number of cars it shipped in 2024 or 2023. The company could get some help from the new slightly cheaper stripped-down versions of the Model 3 and Model Y EVs. But even in that best-case scenario, Tesla is way off the path of 50% year-over-year growth that it once promised to investors and shareholders.\nBut Musk has spent the last few years trying to get shareholders, investors, employees, and everyone else to look beyond the company\u2019s core business of making and selling cars. He\u2019s bet the future of Tesla on being able to create a vast network of self-driving vehicles that he thinks can challenge Uber. And he thinks the humanoid robot, Optimus, will become the best-selling product ever.\nTesla offered little new info on those programs in Wednesday\u2019s letter. Musk said on the conference call that Tesla may start building the third version of Optimus in the first quarter of 2026. He had once promised to build thousands of the robots by the end of this year, but as The Information has reported, Tesla has run into problems in early production with Optimus.\n\u201cBringing Optimus to market is an incredibly difficult task, to be clear. It\u2019s not like some walk in the park,\u201d Musk said.\nBut Musk continued Tesla\u2019s gauzy, unspecific claims about how much Optimus will change the world. \u201cYou can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care,\u201d he said. \u201cOptimus will be an incredible surgeon.\u201d\nThe increased focus on AI, robotics, and self-driving cars (including starting production of the two-seater \u201cCybercab\u201d) will also cost Tesla more next year. Taneja said capital expenditures will increase \u201csubstantially\u201d in 2026 thanks to those projects. He also said Tesla has had to increase employee-related spending to stay competitive in the ongoing AI talent war.\nTesla\u2019s third-quarter results come amid the backdrop of the company\u2019s proposal to hand $1 trillion worth of shares to Musk. That plan is up for a vote at the Tesla\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in a few weeks. The company \u2014 and Musk \u2014 are campaigning hard. While advisor groups like ISS and Glass Lewis are recommending against the pay package, it\u2019s most likely going to pass given the overwhelming support from shareholders on previous efforts.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Musk from threatening to walk away from Tesla if the package isn\u2019t approved.\nOn Wednesday\u2019s call, he reiterated his claim that he cares more about the voting control the compensation package would afford him than the money.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel comfortable building robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations from ISS and Glass Lewis, who have no friggin\u2019 clue. I mean, those guys are corporate terrorists,\u201d Musk said.\nThis story has been updated with new information from Tesla\u2019s third-quarter conference call.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon unveils AI smart glasses for its delivery drivers\ndescription1:\nAmazon announced on Wednesday that it\u2019s developing AI-powered smart glasses for its delivery drivers. The idea behind the glasses is to give delivery drivers a hands-free experience that reduces the need to keep looking between their phone, the package they\u2019re delivering, and their surroundings.\nThe e-commerce giant says the glasses will allow delivery drivers to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery, all without using their phones. The glasses use AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision alongside cameras to create a display that includes things like hazards and delivery tasks.\nAmazon likely hopes that the new glasses will shave time off of each delivery by providing delivery drivers with detailed directions and information about hazards directly in their line of sight.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nWhen a driver parks at a delivery location, Amazon says the glasses automatically activate. The glasses help the driver locate the package inside the vehicle and then navigate to the delivery address. The glasses can provide easy-to-follow directions in places like multi-unit apartment complexes and business locations.\nThe glasses are paired with a controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery, and a dedicated emergency button.\nAmazon notes that the glasses also support prescription lenses and transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nThe retailer is currently trialing the glasses with delivery drivers in North America and plans to refine the technology before a wider rollout.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe announcement doesn\u2019t come as a surprise, as Reuters reported last year that Amazon was working on the smart glasses.\nIn the future, Amazon says the glasses will be able to provide drivers with \u201creal-time defect detection\u201d that could notify them if they accidentally drop off a package at the wrong address. The glasses will also be able to detect pets in yards and automatically adjust to hazards like low light conditions.\nAlso on Wednesday, Amazon unveiled a new robotic arm called \u201cBlue Jay\u201d that can work alongside warehouse employees to pick items off shelves and sort them. Additionally, the tech giant announced a new AI tool called Eluna that will help provide operational insights at Amazon warehouses.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta cuts 600 AI jobs amid ongoing reorganization\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nMeta\u2019s chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, wrote in a memo to staff on Wednesday that the company will cut about 600 jobs from its superintelligence lab, according to a report from Axios.\nMeta declined to comment, but told TechCrunch that Axios\u2019 reporting is accurate.\nAs Meta, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other companies race to build the most powerful AI systems, Meta had a busy summer on the hiring front. The company poached more than 50 researchers from its competitors by offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, though OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed that \u201cnone of [OpenAI\u2019s] best people\u201d took the offers.\n\u201cBy reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,\u201d Wang wrote in the memo to staff.\nThis line of thinking tracks with Meta\u2019s recent \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d \u2014 a more sanitized way to describe the company\u2019s mass layoffs. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff that \u201cleaner is better.\u201d\nNow, it seems that Meta isn\u2019t lowering its overall headcount by much, but rather, reorganizing its efforts. The company claims that most of these people impacted today should be able to find another job within Meta.\n\ntitle3:\nSnapchat makes its first open prompt AI Lens available for free in the US\ndescription3:\nSnapchat is making its new \u201cImagine Lens,\u201d the company\u2019s first open prompt image-generation AI Lens, available to all users for free. The Lens was initially launched in September but only for paid subscribers. With the Lens, users can edit their own Snaps using custom prompts or generate their own.\nFor instance, you could prompt the app, \u201cTurn me into an alien\u201d after snapping a selfie, or request an image of a \u201cgrumpy cat.\u201d The company suggests you could use the Lens to try on Halloween costume ideas, or reimagine your friend in a new look, among other things.\nThe results can be shared with friends, posted to your Story on Snapchat, or shared beyond the app.\nThe broadened availability of the AI Lens follows the launch of AI video-generating apps from Meta (Meta AI) and OpenAI (Sora), which compete for young people\u2019s attention with even more advanced AI tools and features than photo modifications.\nFor instance, Sora lets users generate videos of themselves after providing the app with a one-time video and audio recording to capture their appearance. Friends can share these AI personas, dubbed \u201ccameos,\u201d with one another, so they can star in videos together.\nThat puts pressure on other social apps like Snapchat to keep up, so making the AI image Lens free to use seems a worthwhile investment for the app maker.\nUntil now, Snapchat\u2019s AI Lens was only available to Lens+ and Snapchat Platinum Subscribers, the company says. With the expanded rollout, Snap is making a limited number of image generations available to all free users, as well. At launch, free users in the U.S. will be able to access the new Lens, with plans for other markets underway, starting with Canada, Great Britain, and Australia.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

To create, tap the caption to edit your prompt, or use one of the preloaded suggestions if you need inspiration.\nThe company notes that Snapchat users access Lenses more than 8 billion times per day.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI's Atlas is more about ChatGPT than the web\ndescription4:\nOpenAI unveiled its AI browser, ChatGPT Atlas, during a livestream on Tuesday. There are other AI browsers such as The Browser Company\u2019s Dia, Opera\u2019s Neon, Perplexity\u2019s Comet, and General Catalyst-backed Strawberry. OpenAI\u2019s launch is notable because of the sheer scale of reaching potentially 800 million of its weekly ChatGPT users. For the company, the browser is much more about keeping ChatGPT central than about making web browsing better.\nWhile Atlas is currently available only on the Mac, the company is already working on bringing it to Windows, iOS, and Android \u2014 all the surfaces where ChatGPT already exists. OpenAI has also made the browser available to all users instead of opting for an invite system like its rivals. The core proposition of the browser is for you to think of ChatGPT as the first interaction surface for search and answers instead of Google.\nAll the AI browsers share a similar idea about search and Q&A. Instead of performing a search query, you would type something in your address bar to get answers from an AI chatbot, instead of looking at pages of links.\nAnd OpenAI, just like other browser makers, thinks that Atlas will change the way you browse the web, as Sam Altman made clear at the launch. \u201cWe think AI represents once in a decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be, how to use one, and how to most productively use the web. Tabs were great but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of innovation since then,\u201d Altman said in his opening speech.\nTech leaders, including Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella, have talked about AI as a platform shift. However, for consumers, phones and desktop operating systems are still the primary way to get to their AI tools. OpenAI wants to own the pipes of distribution of ChatGPT as much as it can. Last week, Meta shut its doors to third-party chatbots, including ChatGPT and Perplexity on WhatsApp, which has over 3 billion monthly users. This essentially means that the platform owners could put the brakes on distribution at any point in time.\nFor OpenAI, Atlas will also present an opportunity to deeply integrate ChatGPT and other products better than other platforms can. Users can directly reference multiple websites instead of posting links to ChatGPT. The company already uses a headless browser for its agent. With Atlas, it might have more control over the feature. It has already integrated a hovering writing assistant that shows up in text fields.\nImage Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nWhat\u2019s more, the company is working on integrating its App SDK, which lets you call other apps within ChatGPT, to improve discoverability.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe memory feature is also key for ChatGPT\u2019s power users. The feature takes into account the browsing history, along with your ChatGPT history, to provide answers with that context in mind. You can ask, \u201cWhat was the work document I had my presentation plan on?\u201d and ChatGPT will fetch that link for you. This also means that ChatGPT gets more context about you as you spend more time in the browser. OpenAI can use this context and provide it to other apps when it starts rolling out Sign in with ChatGPT widely.\nBoth features \u2014 making ChatGPT the default search option and enabling memory \u2014 are designed to gather more user data, giving OpenAI greater insight into user behavior and enabling better product development. The browser doesn\u2019t have an ad-blocker, a VPN, a reading mode, or a translate feature to make the browsing experience better for a site. Rather, users have to ask ChatGPT to summarize content or find something on a page \u2014 as if opening a page is designed to give ChatGPT more context rather than to help users consume the content on the page.\nIn contrast, The Browser Company\u2019s Arc has some useful ideas around revamping the browser experience, like using AI to rename downloaded files or customize a web page by letting you remove elements.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nThe result is more than a browser; it\u2019s a broader canvas for ChatGPT itself. OpenAI\u2019s CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, laid out this idea in her blog outlining the Atlas launch.\n\u201cWhen we first released ChatGPT, we weren\u2019t sure how people would use it. Now that we have feedback and signals from hundreds of millions of people around the world, it\u2019s clear ChatGPT needs to become so much more than the simple chatbot it started as. Over time, we see ChatGPT evolving to become the operating system for your life: a fully connected hub that helps you manage your day and achieve your long-term goals,\u201d Simo said.\nThe big question for OpenAI is how to make people, whose default browser is Chrome, Safari, or Edge, switch to its own browser and get some market share out of Google, Apple, and Microsoft\u2019s hands. OpenAI is seeing steady growth in the number of people using ChatGPT. But it is not clear whether an average user would want to mix their browser and chatbot experience just yet. Chrome succeeded because it was fast, and people wanted to use Google queries as the default starting experience of the internet. ChatGPT Atlas is perfect for users who have replaced Google with ChatGPT, but to replace Chrome, OpenAI needs to make sure that billions of users fall into that habit.\"\n\nResponse:",
