Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday April 11), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla used car listings skyrocketed in March\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nA growing number of Tesla owners are putting their used vehicles up for sale, as consumers react to Elon Musk\u2019s political activities and the global protests they have fueled.\nIn March, the number of used Tesla vehicles listed for sale on Autotrader.com skyrocketed, Sherwood News reported, citing data from Autotrader parent company Cox Automotive. The numbers were particularly high in the final week of March, when an average of more than 13,000 used Teslas were listed for sale. Not only was this a record \u2014 it\u2019s up 67% from the same week a year earlier.\nAt the same time, sales of new Tesla vehicles have slowed even as EV sales from other brands rise. Nearly 300,000 new EVs were sold in the first quarter of 2025 in the U.S., according to the latest report from Kelley Blue Book, an increase of 10.6% year over year. Meanwhile, Tesla sales fell in the first quarter, down nearly 9% from the same period in 2024.\nAutomakers like GM and Hyundai still lag behind Tesla. But they\u2019re seeing an uptick in growth. For instance, GM brands sold more than 30,000 EVs in the first quarter, nearly doubling the volume from a year ago, according to Kelley Blue Book.\n\ntitle1:\nDeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis says Google will eventually combine its Gemini and Veo AI models\ndescription1:\nIn a recent appearance on Possible, a podcast co-hosted by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said Google plans to eventually combine its Gemini AI models with its Veo video-generating models to improve the former\u2019s understanding of the physical world.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always built Gemini, our foundation model, to be multimodal from the beginning,\u201d Hassabis said, \u201cand the reason we did that [is because] we have a vision for this idea of a universal digital assistant, an assistant that \u2026 actually helps you in the real world.\u201d\nThe AI industry is moving gradually toward \u201comni\u201d models, if you will \u2014 models that can understand and synthesize many forms of media. Google\u2019s newest Gemini models can generate audio as well as images and text, while OpenAI\u2019s default model in ChatGPT can natively create images \u2014 including, of course, Studio Ghibli-style art. Amazon has also announced plans to launch an \u201cany-to-any\u201d model later this year.\nThese omni models require a lot of training data \u2014 images, videos, audio, text, and so on. Hassabis implied that the video data for Veo is coming mostly from YouTube, a platform that Google owns.\n\u201cBasically, by watching YouTube videos \u2014 a lot of YouTube videos \u2014 [Veo 2] can figure out, you know, the physics of the world,\u201d Hassabis said.\nGoogle previously told TechCrunch its models \u201cmay be\u201d trained on \u201csome\u201d YouTube content in accordance with its agreement with YouTube creators. Reportedly, Google broadened its terms of service last year in part to allow the company to tap more data to train its AI models.\n\ntitle2:\nFintech founder charged with fraud after 'AI' shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines\ndescription2:\nAlbert Saniger, the founder and former CEO of Nate, an AI shopping app that promised a \u201cuniversal\u201d checkout experience, was charged with defrauding investors on Wednesday, according to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice.\nFounded in 2018, Nate raised over $50 million from investors like Coatue and Forerunner Ventures, most recently raising a $38 million Series A in 2021 led by Renegade Partners.\nNate said its app\u2019s users could buy from any e-commerce site with a single click, thanks to AI. In reality, however, Nate relied heavily on hundreds of human contractors in a call center in the Philippines to manually complete those purchases, the DOJ\u2019s Southern District of New York alleges.\nSaniger raised millions in venture funding by claiming that Nate was able to transact online \u201cwithout human intervention,\u201d except for edge cases where the AI failed to complete a transaction. But despite Nate acquiring some AI technology and hiring data scientists, its app\u2019s actual automation rate was effectively 0%, the DOJ claims.\nNate\u2019s heavy usage of human contractors was the subject of an investigation by The Information in 2022.\nSaniger didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. He is currently listed as a managing partner at New York VC Buttercore Partners, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment either.\nThe DOJ\u2019s indictment says that Nate ran out of money and was forced to sell its assets in January 2023, leaving its investors with \u201cnear total\u201d losses. Albert Saniger\u2019s LinkedIn profile indicates he was no longer CEO as of 2023.\nNate isn\u2019t the only startup that has allegedly exaggerated its AI capabilities. For example, an \u201cAI\u201d drive-through software startup was also powered largely by humans in the Philippines, The Verge reported in 2023.\nMore recently, Business Insider reported that an AI legal tech unicorn, EvenUp, used humans to do much of its work.\n\ntitle3:\nWhatsApp introduces new features across chats, calls, and channels\ndescription3:\nWhatsApp has announced a slew of new updates across chats, calls, and channels designed to enhance the messaging and calling experience for users as it continues to compete with popular services like Telegram and Discord.\nAmong the most notable additions is an \u201cOnline\u201d indicator that appears at the top of a group chat to show you how many people are currently around to chat.\nAnother new group chat feature will allow you to highlight certain notifications, as you can now use a newly added \u201cNotify for\u201d setting and select \u201cHighlights\u201d to limit notifications for @mentions, replies, and messages from saved contacts or \u201cAll\u201d to receive all notifications.\nAnother feature offers the option to scan and send documents on an iPhone. To access this, users select \u201cscan document\u201d from the attachment options and then follow the steps to scan, crop, and save the document.\nAlso, iPhone users can now set WhatsApp as their default messaging and calling app. Plus, iPhone users can now pinch to zoom in during video calls.\nImage Credits:WhatsApp\nAs for video calls, WhatsApp says it upgraded its technology to make video calls more reliable and of higher quality, which should lead to reduced dropped calls and video freezing. The app\u2019s improved bandwidth detection should also allow for more HD-quality video calls.\nWhile WhatsApp has allowed users to create events in group chats for some time now, it\u2019s now rolling out the ability to create an event in 1:1 conversations. Plus, the events feature is getting updated with the ability to RSVP as \u201cmaybe,\u201d invite a plus one, add an end date and time, and pin events so they\u2019re easier to find.\nIn addition, you can now add someone to an ongoing 1:1 call from a chat thread by tapping the call icon at the top of your screen and then selecting \u201cAdd to call.\u201d\nChannels are also getting three updates, as admins can now record and share short videos with followers and share unique QR codes that link directly to their channel. Plus, you can now get a written summary of voice message updates from channels to get yourself up to speed when you\u2019re on the go and unable to read individual messages.\n\ntitle4:\nStripe CEO says he ensures his top leaders interview a customer twice a month\ndescription4:\nDigital payments platform Stripe invites customers to join its management team meetings on a bi-weekly basis so it can get \u201ccandid feedback,\u201d according to co-founder Patrick Collison.\nIn an April 8 post on X, the fintech giant\u2019s CEO said the company has a customer join for the first 30 minutes of the meeting, which is attended by about 40 leaders \u201cfrom across Stripe.\u201d\n\u201cEven though we already have a lot of customer feedback mechanisms, it somehow always spurs new thoughts and investigations,\u201d he wrote.\nIt\u2019s an interesting strategy from Stripe, which was founded in 2010 and is considered to be the highest-valued private fintech in the world (its most recent valuation was $91.5 billion).\nOver the years, startups have complained anecdotally that Stripe is more focused on its larger customers than the smaller ones it set out to serve. But the company must be doing something right. Stripe\u2019s annual letter in February penned by Collison noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before.\nStripe also added in the letter that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups into a major enterprise player.\nIn the post on X, Collison responded to the Cloudflare CTO\u2019s question of when his company would get an invite with a, \u201cWould love to have you guys\u2026will reach out.\u201d\nTo the point of smaller businesses feeling neglected, one investor wrote: \u201cHi Patrick \u2013 you know I admire @Stripe \u2013 but you should pay attention to the extent things have degraded for the indie community using Stripe. I messaged support a week ago \u2013 no reply, things are super complicated. There\u2019s more stuff, but it\u2019s a mess.\u201d\nMany praised the move, with one user noting: \u201cLove this. Keeps the culture focused on what matters and helps reconciles (sic) reality.\u201d\nAnd, naturally, some Stripe customers used the X post to post their complaints (here and here).\nHowever, one high-profile founder seemed to approve of Stripe\u2019s approach: Elon Musk replied to the post with a simple, \u201cGood idea.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
