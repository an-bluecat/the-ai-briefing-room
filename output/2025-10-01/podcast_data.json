Gavin Newsom signed into law this week, is proof that state regulation doesn\u2019t have to hinder AI progress.\nSo says Adam Billen, vice president of public policy at youth-led advocacy group Encode AI, on today\u2019s episode of Equity.\n\u201cThe reality is that policy makers themselves know that we have to do something, and they know from working on a million other issues that there is a way to pass legislation that genuinely does protect innovation \u2014 which I do care about \u2014 while making sure that these products are safe,\u201d Billen told TechCrunch.\nAt its core, SB 53 is a first-in-the-nation bill that requires large AI labs to be transparent about their safety and security protocols \u2014 specifically around how they prevent their models from catastrophic risks, like being used to commit cyberattacks on critical infrastructure or build bio-weapons. The law also mandates that companies stick to those protocols, which will be enforced by the Office of Emergency Services.\n\u201cCompanies are already doing the stuff that we ask them to do in this bill,\u201d Billen told TechCrunch. \u201cThey do safety testing on their models. They release model cards. Are they starting to skimp in some areas at some companies? Yes. And that\u2019s why bills like this are important.\u201d\nBillen also noted that some AI firms have a policy around relaxing safety standards under competitive pressure. OpenAI, for example, has publicly stated that it may \u201cadjust\u201d its safety requirements if a rival AI lab releases a high-risk system without similar safeguards. Billen argues that policy can enforce companies\u2019 existing safety promises, preventing them from cutting corners under competitive or financial pressure.\nWhile public opposition to SB 53 was muted in comparison to its predecessor SB 1047, which Newsom vetoed last year, the rhetoric in Silicon Valley and among most AI labs has been that almost any AI regulation is anathema to progress and will ultimately hinder the U.S. in its race to beat China.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIt\u2019s why companies like Meta, VCs like Andreessen Horowitz, and powerful individuals like OpenAI president Greg Brockman are collectively pumping hundreds of millions into super PACs to back pro-AI politicians in state elections. And it\u2019s why those same forces earlier this year pushed for an AI moratorium that would have banned states from regulating AI for 10 years.\nEncode AI ran a coalition of more than 200 organizations to work to strike down the proposal, but Billen says the fight isn\u2019t over. Senator Ted Cruz, who championed the moratorium, is attempting a new strategy to achieve the same goal of federal preemption of state laws. In September, Cruz introduced the SANDBOX Act, which would allow AI companies to apply for waivers to temporarily bypass certain federal regulations for up to 10 years. Billen also anticipates a forthcoming bill establishing a federal AI standard that would be pitched as a middle-ground solution but would in reality override state laws.\nHe warned that narrowly scoped federal AI legislation could \u201cdelete federalism for the most important technology of our time.\u201d\n\u201cIf you told me SB 53 was the bill that would replace all the state bills on everything related to AI and all of the potential risks, I would tell you that\u2019s probably not a very good idea and that this bill is designed for a particular subset of things,\u201d Billen said.\nAdam Billen, vice president of public policy, Encode AI Image Credits:Encode AI\nWhile he agrees that the AI race with China matters, and that policymakers need to enact regulation that will support American progress, he says killing state bills \u2014 which mainly focus on deepfakes, transparency, algorithmic discrimination, children\u2019s safety, and governmental use of AI \u2014 isn\u2019t the way to go about doing that.\n\u201cAre bills like SB 53 the thing that will stop us from beating China? No,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is just genuinely intellectually dishonest to say that that is the thing that will stop us in the race.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIf the thing you care about is beating China in the race on AI \u2014 and I do care about that \u2014 then the things you would push for are stuff like export controls in Congress,\u201d Billen said. \u201cYou would make sure that American companies have the chips. But that\u2019s not what the industry is pushing for.\u201d\nLegislative proposals like the Chip Security Act aim to prevent the diversion of advanced AI chips to China through export controls and tracking devices, and the existing CHIPS and Science Act seeks to boost domestic chip production. However, some major tech companies, including OpenAI and Nvidia, have expressed reluctance or opposition to certain aspects of these efforts, citing concerns about effectiveness, competitiveness, and security vulnerabilities.\nNvidia has its reasons \u2014 it has a strong financial incentive to continue selling chips to China, which has historically represented a significant portion of its global revenue. Billen speculated that OpenAI could hold back on chip export advocacy to stay in the good graces of crucial suppliers like Nvidia.\nThere\u2019s also been inconsistent messaging from the Trump administration. Three months after expanding an export ban on advanced AI chips to China in April 2025, the administration reversed course, allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell some chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue.\n\u201cYou see people on the Hill moving towards bills like the Chip Security Act that would put export controls on China,\u201d Billen said. \u201cIn the meantime, there\u2019s going to continue to be this propping up of the narrative to kill state bills that are actually quite light tough.\u201d\nBillen added that SB 53 is an example of democracy in action \u2014 of industry and policymakers working together to get to a version of a bill that everyone can agree on. It\u2019s \u201cvery ugly and messy,\u201d but \u201cthat process of democracy and federalism is the entire foundation of our country and our economic system, and I hope that we will keep doing that successfully.\u201d\n\u201cI think SB 53 is one of the best proof points that that can still work,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle1:\nInstagram head says company is not using your microphone to listen to you (with AI data, it won't need to)\ndescription1:\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri posted on his account on Wednesday to dispel the myth that the social networking giant is actively \u201clistening\u201d to its users surreptitiously, in order to target them with relevant ads. The idea that Meta would secretly turn on the microphones on users\u2019 phones to record their conversations is an age-old conspiracy theory \u2014 and one that the company has disputed before.\nBut, ironically, Mosseri\u2019s new myth-busting claim comes just as Meta has announced it will soon target ads to users across its social apps using data collected from their interactions with its AI products.\nIn other words, if Meta didn\u2019t need to record your conversations via your microphone before to produce eerily accurate recommendations, it definitely won\u2019t need to now.\nOn Instagram, Mosseri says he\u2019s had a number of conversations about Meta listening to its users, many of whom can\u2019t believe how well the company\u2019s ad targeting actually works. (Even his wife has brought up the topic, he says.)\nBy now, most of us have either had the experience ourselves or at least know someone who claims that Meta must have been secretly recording them to know what they were likely to click on. Sometimes, you are only thinking about a topic or product, and then see the content appear in your feed, making it seem as if Meta is a mind reader.\nThe company has repeatedly disputed these claims, trying to explain that it doesn\u2019t have to record your conversations to make its recommendations so successful. (Mosseri also says that would be a \u201cgross violation of privacy,\u201d but Meta is not a company that typically drives decisions with user privacy in mind.)\nStill, the company doesn\u2019t necessarily have to \u201clisten\u201d to users to listen to them.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIn 2016, Meta (then known as Facebook) published a blog post that outright stated that it didn\u2019t use your phone\u2019s microphone to determine what ads to show users or what content appears in their News Feed. Years later, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress, denying once again that the company was collecting users\u2019 audio data for this purpose.\nHappy to have something it can deny on the privacy front, just as it\u2019s about to scoop up more data than ever before, Mosseri reiterates these points in his post on Instagram.\nHe says that, for starters, users would know if their phone\u2019s microphone was on because they would see a light at the top of their screen, and the phone\u2019s battery would drain faster.\nInstead, Mosseri explains that the tech giant\u2019s recommendation system is so powerful because of how it works with its advertisers, who share information with the company about who has visited their websites. That information helps Meta target users with relevant ads. In addition, the company shows people ads that it thinks they may be interested in based on what similar people with similar interests are also interested in. This algorithm-based ad tech has made Meta a money-printing machine over the years.\nNow Meta is going to leverage AI to make these ad-targeting decisions. So if people thought they were being listened to before, it will only get worse. The company said its new privacy policy, which is being released on December 16, will allow it to use data from consumers\u2019 interactions with its AI products in most markets as another signal. And it\u2019s a potentially even more powerful one than the \u201cpeople who like this also like that\u201d system, given that users are engaging in far more personal conversations with AI chatbots like Meta AI about their interests, ideas, and activities.\nMosseri also points out that sometimes it\u2019s not technology alone that\u2019s driving the hyper-accurate recommendations \u2014 it\u2019s either just a coincidence or a bit of human psychology at play.\n\u201cYou might have actually seen that ad before you had the conversation and not realized it,\u201d he points out. \u201cWe scroll quickly. We scroll by ads quickly. And sometimes you internalize some of that, and that actually affects what you talk about later,\u201d Mosseri says.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI staff grapples with the company's social media push\ndescription2:\nSeveral current and former OpenAI researchers are speaking out over the company\u2019s first foray into social media: the Sora app, a TikTok-style feed filled with AI-generated videos and a lot of Sam Altman deepfakes. The researchers, airing their grievances on X, seem torn over how the launch fits into OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit mission to develop advanced AI that benefits humanity.\n\u201cAI-based feeds are scary,\u201d said OpenAI pretraining researcher John Hallman in a post on X. \u201cI won\u2019t deny that I felt some concern when I first learned we were releasing Sora 2. That said, I think the team did the absolute best job they possibly could in designing a positive experience \u2026 We\u2019re going to do our best to make sure AI helps and does not hurt humanity.\u201d\nAI-based feeds are scary. I won't deny that I felt some concern when I first learned we were releasing Sora 2.\nThat said, I think the team did the absolute best job they possible could in designing a positive experience. Compared to other platforms, I find myself scrolling way\u2026 https://t.co/uLeeVMKncl \u2014 John Hallman (@johnohallman) September 30, 2025\nBoaz Barak, another OpenAI researcher and Harvard professor, replied: \u201cI share a similar mix of worry and excitement. Sora 2 is technically amazing but it\u2019s premature to congratulate ourselves on avoiding the pitfalls of other social media apps and deepfakes.\u201d\nFormer OpenAI researcher Rohan Pandey used the moment to plug a new startup, Periodic Labs, which is made up of former AI lab researchers trying to build AI systems for scientific discovery: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to build the infinite AI TikTok slop machine but want to develop AI that accelerates fundamental science \u2026 come join us at Periodic Labs.\u201d\nThere were many other posts along the same lines.\nThe Sora launch highlights a core tension for OpenAI that flares up time and time again. It\u2019s the fastest-growing consumer tech company on Earth, but it\u2019s also a frontier AI lab with a lofty nonprofit charter. Some former OpenAI employees I\u2019ve spoken to argue the consumer business can, in theory, serve the mission: ChatGPT helps fund AI research and distribute the technology widely.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said as much in a post on X Wednesday, addressing why the company is allocating so much capital and computing power to an AI social media app:\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

In other words, when does OpenAI say no to a money-making, platform-growing opportunity because it\u2019s at odds with the mission?\nThe question looms as regulators scrutinize OpenAI\u2019s for-profit transition, which OpenAI needs to complete to raise additional capital and eventually go public. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said last month that he is \u201cparticularly concerned with ensuring that the stated safety mission of OpenAI as a nonprofit remains front and center\u201d in the restructuring.\nSkeptics have dismissed OpenAI\u2019s mission as a branding tool to lure talent from Big Tech. But many insiders at OpenAI insist it\u2019s central to why they joined the company in the first place.\nFor now, Sora\u2019s footprint is small; the app is one day old. But its debut marks a significant expansion of OpenAI\u2019s consumer business and exposes the company to incentives that have plagued social media apps for decades.\nUnlike ChatGPT, which is optimized for usefulness, OpenAI says Sora is built for fun \u2014 a place to generate and share AI clips. The feed feels closer to TikTok or Instagram Reels, platforms that are infamous for their addictive loops.\nOpenAI insists it wants to avoid those pitfalls, claiming in a blog post announcing the Sora launch that \u201cconcerns about doomscrolling, addiction, isolation, and RL-sloptimized feeds are top of mind.\u201d The company explicitly says it\u2019s not optimizing for time spent on feed and instead wants to maximize creation. OpenAI says it will send reminders to users when they\u2019ve been scrolling for too long, and primarily show them people they know.\nThat\u2019s a stronger starting point than Meta\u2019s Vibes \u2014 another AI-powered short-form video feed released last week \u2014 which seems to have been raced out without as many safeguards. As a former OpenAI policy leader, Miles Brundage points out that it\u2019s possible there will be good and bad applications of AI-video feeds, much like we\u2019ve seen in the chatbot era.\nStill, as Altman has long acknowledged, no one sets out to build an addictive app. The incentives of running a feed guide them to it. OpenAI has even run into problems around sycophancy in ChatGPT, which the company says was unintentional due to some of its training techniques.\nIn a June podcast, Altman discussed what he calls \u201cthe big misalignment of social media.\u201d\n\u201cOne of the big mistakes of the social media era was [that] the feed algorithms had a bunch of unintended, negative consequences on society as a whole, and maybe even individual users. Although they were doing the thing that a user wanted \u2014 or someone thought users wanted \u2014 in the moment, which is [to] get them to, like, keep spending time on the site.\u201d\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell how aligned the Sora app is with its users or OpenAI\u2019s mission. Users are already noticing some engagement-optimizing techniques in the app, such as the dynamic emojis that appear every time you like a video. That feels designed to shoot a little dopamine to users for engaging with a video.\nThe real test will be how OpenAI evolves Sora. Given how much AI has taken over regular social media feeds, it seems plausible that AI-native feeds could soon have their moment. Whether OpenAI can grow Sora without replicating the mistakes of its predecessors remains to be seen.\n\ntitle3:\nHollywood is not taking kindly to the AI-generated actress Tilly Norwood\ndescription3:\nTilly Norwood is a London-based actress with about 40,000 Instagram followers. Also, she\u2019s not real \u2014 she is an AI-generated character created by Xicoia, the AI division of the production company Particle6.\nEline Van der Velden, the Dutch producer who founded Particle6, introduced the idea of Norwood at the Zurich Film Festival in September. Van der Velden is currently seeking an agent to represent Norwood, who has garnered strong reactions from Hollywood.\nActress Emily Blunt \u2014 known for her roles in films like \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d \u201cA Quiet Place,\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d \u2014 found out about Norwood while recording a podcast with Variety.\n\u201cGood Lord, we\u2019re screwed.

Neither Einride, nor its investors, disclosed the company\u2019s post-money valuation.\nThe funding comes as Einride adjusts to a new CEO and tries to scale its three business products: electric big rigs, autonomous pod-like trucks that navigate fixed routes, and planning software designed for shippers. Einride CEO Roozbeh Charli said the funding would allow the company to grow with its customer base and accelerate the deployment of its autonomous freight technology.\nThe company, which was founded in 2016, started in Sweden with a mission to disrupt the freight industry \u2014 first with electric trucks, then with electric autonomous pods, which are purpose-built without a steering wheel or pedals for self-driving.\nEinride has expanded beyond Sweden and operates a fleet of heavy-duty electric trucks in Europe, North America, and the UAE, for companies like PepsiCo, Carlsberg Sweden, and DP World. The company has made some inroads with its autonomous pod-like trucks with customers Apotea in Sweden and GE Appliances in the United States.\n\u201cWe believe Einride is building the most complete and forward-looking freight ecosystem on the market today,\u201d Ted Persson, partner at EQT Ventures, said in a statement. \u201cNordic tech has a habit of being underestimated, until it quietly rewires an entire industry. That\u2019s exactly what Einride is doing in freight.\u201d\nStill, Einride has undergone internal changes and has grappled \u2014 along with the rest of the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector \u2014 with the long and expensive process of moving from development to commercial operations.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
