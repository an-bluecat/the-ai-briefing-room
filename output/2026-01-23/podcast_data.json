TikTok CEO Shou Chew will serve as a director.\nThe venture\u2019s three managing investors, Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment company MGX, will each hold a 15% stake. Other investors include Michael Dell\u2019s family investment firm, along with several smaller investors.\nTikTok USDS Joint Venture \u201cwill operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\u201d TikTok said.\nThe joint venture will operate as an independent entity governed by seven members. In addition to Chew, the board includes Timothy Dattels, a senior adviser to investment firm TPG Global, Mark Dooley of Susquehanna International Group, co-CEO of Silver Lake Egon Durban, CEO of DXC Technology Raul Fernandez, Kenneth Glueck of Oracle, and David Scott of MGX.\nTrump celebrated the deal in a post on Truth Social, stating that the app \u201cwill now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo probed by National Transportation Safety Board over illegal school bus behavior\ndescription1:\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has opened an investigation into Waymo after its robotaxis have been spotted illegally passing stopped school buses numerous times in at least two states.\nThe NTSB is specifically focusing on the more than 20 incidents that have occurred in Austin, Texas, it said in a post on X on Friday.\n\u201cInvestigators will travel to Austin to gather information on a series of incidents in which the automated vehicles failed to stop for loading or unloading students,\u201d the NTSB said in a statement to TechCrunch. A preliminary report is expected within 30 days, and the safety board will publish a more detailed final report in 12 to 24 months.\nIt\u2019s the first time Waymo has been investigated by the NTSB, but it\u2019s the second investigation launched into Waymo over its school bus problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s (NHTSA) Office of Defects Investigation opened a similar probe in October.\nWaymo also issued a software recall last year to address the problem. But previous software updates have not been enough to stamp it out, and in Austin, Texas \u2014 where the bulk of incidents have been captured on camera \u2014 the school district has asked the company to suspend operations during pickup and drop-off times.\nThe new investigation comes as Waymo is in the middle of a rapid expansion around the United States. Just this week, the company started offering a robotaxi service in Miami, adding to its operations in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\u201cWe safely navigate thousands of school bus encounters weekly across the United States, and the Waymo Driver is continuously improving. There have been no collisions in the events in question, and we are confident that our safety performance around school buses is superior to human drivers,\u201d Mauricio Pe\u00f1a, Waymo\u2019s chief safety officer, said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWe see this as an opportunity to provide the NTSB with transparent insights into our safety-first approach.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe NTSB is different from the NHTSA in that it is not a federal regulatory agency. It cannot issue fines or penalties. Rather, the safety board usually performs deep investigations to identify root causes of problems in the transportation world. When an investigation is complete, the board often holds hearings and issues non-binding recommendations.\nThe first notable incident where a Waymo vehicle passed a stopped school bus happened last September in Atlanta. The Waymo pulled out of a driveway and crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from the bus\u2019 right side. The robotaxi then turned left and proceeded down the street while kids were getting off the bus.\nWaymo said at the time that the vehicle was unable to see the stop sign or flashing lights, and has since said that it addressed this particular scenario with a software update.\nBut as Waymo patched the specific scenario it encountered in Atlanta, some of the company\u2019s vehicles were caught passing stopped school buses in Austin, Texas. Local news outlet KXAN published videos it received from cameras mounted on school buses that showed Waymo vehicles making illegal maneuvers on multiple occasions.\n\u201cWe continue to engage productively with the Austin Independent School District and applaud their reported success in reducing human-driven violations around school buses from 10,000+ a year,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.\n\ntitle2:\nTikTok users freak out over app\u2019s \u2018immigration status\u2019 collection \u2014 here\u2019s what it means\ndescription2:\nWith the change in TikTok ownership, TikTok users in the U.S. are collectively freaking out over the company\u2019s updated privacy policy after being alerted to the changes through an in-app message. The revised document details the U.S. joint venture\u2019s conditions for using its service, including the specific location information it may collect. Many users are also posting to social media about language found in the policy, which says that TikTok could collect sensitive information about its users, including their \u201csexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status.\u201d\nBut despite the panic, this disclosure isn\u2019t new \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t mean what many users fear. The same language appeared in TikTok\u2019s privacy policy before the ownership deal closed, and it\u2019s primarily there to comply with state privacy laws like California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act, which requires companies to agree to disclose to consumers what \u201csensitive information\u201d is collected. Similar disclosures appear in other social media apps\u2019 policies.\nTo understand why users are concerned \u2014 and why the policy reads this way \u2014 it helps to look at both the current political climate and the legal requirements TikTok is navigating.\nSpecifically, the policy states that TikTok could process information from users\u2019 content or what they may share through surveys, including information about their \u201cracial or ethnic origin, national origin, religious beliefs, mental or physical health diagnosis, sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Americans would find this type of language troubling, especially given the current political climate.\nThe escalation of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has led to widespread protests across the country, which have now come to a head in Minnesota. On Friday, hundreds of businesses closed their doors in an economic blackout to protest the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the state. The move follows weeks of clashes between Minnesota residents and ICE agents, which have led to thousands of arrests and the death of American citizen Ren\u00e9e Good.\nImage Credits:Screenshot of a public post on Threads\nImage Credits:Screenshot of a public post on Threads\nBut the privacy policy language predates these concerns. In TikTok\u2019s earlier policy, updated on August 19, 2024, the company explained that some of the information it collects and uses may \u201cconstitute sensitive personal information\u201d under state privacy laws.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIt then proceeded to list those same categories as examples. The legal reason is straightforward.\nThe policy\u2019s specificity around types of \u201csensitive information\u201d has to do with state privacy laws, like California\u2019s California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA). The latter, for instance, requires businesses to inform consumers when they collect \u201csensitive information,\u201d which the law defines as including things like:\nA consumer\u2019s social security, driver\u2019s license, state identification card, or passport number\nA consumer\u2019s account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account\nA consumer\u2019s precise geolocation\nA consumer\u2019s racial or ethnic origin, citizenship or immigration status, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership\nThe contents of a consumer\u2019s mail, email, and text messages, unless the business is the intended recipient of the communication\nA consumer\u2019s genetic data\nA consumer\u2019s neural data\nBiometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer\nPersonal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer\u2019s health\nPersonal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation\nOf note, citizenship and immigration status were specifically added to the category of \u201csensitive personal information\u201d when California Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB-947 into law on October 8, 2023.\nBecause of the in-app alert timed to the deal\u2019s closure (a requirement because of the new legal entity), many people are now reading through TikTok\u2019s terms for the first time. Seeing this language and fearing the worst, they are posting to social media about their concerns and warning others; some are even threatening to delete their accounts.\nImage Credits:Screenshot of a public post on Threads\nImage Credits:Screenshot of a public post on Threads\nImage Credits:Screenshot of a public post on Threads\nBut what TikTok\u2019s policy is actually saying is that, as part of operating its app, it may process sensitive information \u2014 especially if it\u2019s the subject of someone\u2019s video \u2014 and that it\u2019s agreeing to process that sensitive information \u201cin accordance with applicable law.\u201d\nThe policy even references the CCPA by name, as an example of the applicable laws TikTok is agreeing to.\n\u201cTikTok is required under those laws to notify users in the privacy policy that the sensitive personal information is being collected, how it is being used, and with whom it is being shared,\u201d explains Jennifer Daniels, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome, where she provides counsel on regulatory and general corporate law matters.\nHer colleague, Philip Yannella, co-chair of Blank Rome\u2019s Privacy, Security, and Data Protection Practice, points out that TikTok likely decided to include this language in its privacy policy because of litigation concerns. For instance, he says that lately, he has seen several demands under the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) from plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who alleged \u201cthe collection of racial, immigration, and ethnic data.\u201d\nA similar type of disclosure to TikTok\u2019s can be found in other social media apps, though some companies keep the explanations more high-level, while others, like TikTok, will list out the precise categories that are legally defined as \u201csensitive information\u201d for additional clarity.\nStill, at least one lawyer consulted by TechCrunch noted that spelling out these specific sensitive details so precisely can actually make things less clear to the end users.\nAs a point of comparison, Meta\u2019s privacy policy gets fairly granular, too, though it doesn\u2019t specifically include \u201cimmigration status\u201d as one of its examples of sensitive information:\nImage Credits:Screenshot from Meta's privacy policy\nImage Credits:Screenshot from Meta's privacy policy\nUsers on social media often share deeply personal topics, explains Ashlee Difuntorum, an associate at Kinsella Holley Iser Kump Steinsapir (KHIKS) and a business litigator with experience representing software and technology companies.\n\u201cTikTok is essentially saying that if you disclose something sensitive, that information becomes part of the content the platform technically \u2018collects,\u2019\u201d she tells TechCrunch. \u201cPolicies like this often look alarming because they\u2019re written for regulators and litigators, not for ordinary consumers. That said, the wording can understandably strike users as intrusive when it\u2019s laid out so bluntly.\u201d\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment.\nOf course, sharing content on social media sites isn\u2019t without risk, particularly under authoritarian governments that target their own citizens. These apps collect gobs of data, and governments can enact laws to gain access to it.\nIronically, the decision to move TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to the U.S. under new ownership was due to this exact concern, but with China then seen as the potential threat.\nChinese laws require companies to assist with state intelligence and data security, including its 2017 National Intelligence Law and its 2021 Data Security Law. The fear among U.S. lawmakers was that TikTok\u2019s ownership by a Chinese entity, ByteDance, could put U.S. citizens at risk, either via surveillance or subtle changes to the app\u2019s algorithm designed to influence people or promote Chinese propaganda.\nNow, people in the U.S. are more worried about their own government\u2019s potential surveillance rather than China\u2019s.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta pauses teen access to AI characters ahead of new version\ndescription3:\nMeta today said that it is pausing teens\u2019 access to its AI characters globally across all its apps. The company mentioned that it is not abandoning its efforts but wants to develop an updated version of AI characters for teens, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.\nThe move comes days before a case against Meta is set to go to trial in New Mexico, in which the company is accused of not making an effort to protect kids from sexual exploitation on its apps. Wired reported Thursday that Meta has sought to limit discovery related to social media\u2019s impact on teen mental health.\nIn October, the company previewed parental controls for AI characters, allowing parents and guardians to monitor topics and block access to certain characters. Meta said parents would be able to completely turn off chats with AI characters. These features were set to release this year, but the company is now turning off AI characters altogether for teens while it updates the AI characters to a newer version.\nMeta said that it heard from parents that they wanted more insights and control over their teens\u2019 interactions with AI characters, which is why it decided to make these changes.\nThe company has been cracking down on teens\u2019 access to AI content in its apps. Also in October, Meta rolled out parental control features on Instagram, focusing on tailoring the teen experience of interacting with AI on its apps. These features, which were inspired by the PG-13 movie rating, restricted teen access to certain topics like extreme violence, nudity, and graphic drug use.\nMeta\u2019s previously previewed controls around AI characters. Image Credits:Meta\n\u201cStarting in the coming weeks, teens will no longer be able to access AI characters across our apps until the updated experience is ready. This will apply to anyone who has given us a teen birthday, as well as people who claim to be adults but who we suspect are teens based on our age prediction technology,\u201d the company said in an updated blog post.\nMeta added that when it rolls out the new AI characters, they will have built-in parental controls. The company said that the new characters will give age-appropriate responses and will stick to topics like education, sport, and hobbies.\nSocial media companies are under heavy scrutiny from regulators. Apart from the aforementioned case in New Mexico, Meta is also facing a trial next week, where the platform is accused of causing social media addiction. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to take the witness stand in that case once the trial begins.\nBesides social platforms, AI companies have had to modify their experience for teens after facing lawsuits alleging to play a part in aiding self-harm. In October, Character.AI, the startup that allows users to chat with various AI avatars, disallowed open-ended conversations with chatbots for users who were under 18. In November, the startup said it would build interactive stories for kids. In the last few months, OpenAI added new teen safety rules for ChatGPT and started predicting a user\u2019s age to apply content restrictions.\nCorrection: This post was updated to clarify the new version of AI characters will be accessible to everyone, not just teens, when it launches. It will include parental controls.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft gave FBI a set of BitLocker encryption keys to unlock suspects' laptops: Reports\ndescription4:\nMicrosoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, Forbes reported on Friday.\nMany modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is enabled by default. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.\nBut, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft\u2019s cloud, allowing the tech giant \u2014 and by extension law enforcement \u2014 to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.\nThe case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News covered the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects\u2019 hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, also reported in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.\nA spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.\nApart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green raised the potential scenario where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft\u2019s cloud infrastructure \u2014 something that has happened several times in recent years \u2014 and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,\u201d Green wrote in a post on Bluesky. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
