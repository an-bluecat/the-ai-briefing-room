Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday November 25), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title1:\nOpenAI learned the hard way that Cameo trademarked the word 'cameo'\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI\u2019s social app Sora launched with a controversial feature called Cameo, allowing users to deepfake themselves or others (with permission). The feature had a tenuous rollout \u2014 Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s estate had to get involved, to give you an idea of what went on \u2014 but now it faces a new challenge.\nApparently, Cameo \u2014 the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities \u2014 can claim the trademark of the word \u201ccameo.\u201d\nU.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word \u201ccameo,\u201d as well as any similar-sounding words or phrases, on Sora.\nThe temporary restraining order issued on November 21, 2025 is set to expire on December 22, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at 11:00 a.m.\nAs of Monday afternoon, the Sora app still uses the \u201ccameo\u201d language, however.\n\u201cWe are gratified by the court\u2019s decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,\u201d Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. \u201cWhile the court\u2019s order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.\u201d\nOpenAI disagrees with the assertion that the company can claim exclusive ownership over the word \u201ccameo,\u201d the company told CNBC.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla FSD software may not be approved by EU regulator after all\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nTesla may have celebrated a regulatory win in Europe a bit too soon.\nTesla claimed in a weekend social media post that Dutch regulator RDW was set to approve the use of its driver assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving, or FSD, in February 2026. The organization handles the licensing and registration of vehicles in the Netherlands and is seen as a critical step for Tesla to get approval for \u2014 and eventually roll out \u2014 FSD to consumers across Europe.\n\u201cRDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,\u201d Tesla wrote in the post.\nIt seems RDW isn\u2019t quite in line with Tesla. The Dutch regulator clarified in a statement on their website that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February. Bloomberg was first to report on RDW\u2019s statement.\n\u201cRDW and Tesla know what efforts need to be made to make a decision on this in February. Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,\u201d the statement reads.\nTesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times.\nFSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle teams up with Accel to hunt for India's next AI breakouts\ndescription3:\nGoogle has partnered with Accel to find and fund India\u2019s earliest-stage AI startups in a first-of-its-kind collaboration for the Google AI Futures Fund, launched earlier this year.\nOn Tuesday, Accel and Google announced a partnership to jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through Accel\u2019s Atoms program, with both firms contributing up to $1 million. The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one.\n\u201cThe thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,\u201d Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch.\nIndia is an appealing market with the world\u2019s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it\u2019s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn\u2019t produced many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China.\nActivity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including OpenAI and Anthropic have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market \u2014 if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products.\nSwaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. \u201cThe future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt could even be foundational models.\u201d\nSwaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAlongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google\u2019s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google\u2019s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said.\n\u201cIndia has an incredible history of innovation, and we firmly believe that its founders are going to be playing a leading role in the next generation of AI-led global technology,\u201d Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of the Google AI Futures Fund, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis is the Futures Fund\u2019s first such collaboration anywhere in the world, and we chose India for a reason. Google has been a committed partner in the country\u2019s journey to digital transformation, with multibillion-dollar investments over the years.\u201d\nThe partnership follows Google\u2019s recent $15 billion plan to build a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India. The company also announced a $10 billion digitization fund in 2020, which has backed firms including Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Walmart-owned Flipkart. Last month, Google partnered with Reliance to offer millions of Jio users free access to AI Pro.\nGoogle launched the AI Futures Fund in May as a dedicated vehicle to invest in and collaborate with AI startups globally. It has backed companies including Replit and Harvey, and has also invested directly in Indian startups such as Toonsutra and STAN.\nSilber told TechCrunch that Google would appear on the cap tables of startups funded through the partnership and would be \u201ca material presence,\u201d but declined to share how its equity stakes would compare with Accel\u2019s.\n\u201cThis is our attempt to work with the market leader in the space who knows the country incredibly well, that can get us talking to earlier-stage founders at an early informative stage, that can move the needle,\u201d Silber said.\nWhile using Google products is, perhaps, a given for applicants to this program, both Silber and Swaroop told TechCrunch there would be no requirements for startups to exclusively use Gemini or any other Google product.\n\u201cSometimes, Google\u2019s technology is the best. Other times, you\u2019ll see Anthropic or OpenAI. So, we\u2019re not putting firm requirements that say you can only use Google\u2019s models,\u201d said Silber. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping to do, though, is find a couple of different unique integrations that we can do with these companies that leverage Google AI technology.\u201d\nLaunched in 2021, Accel\u2019s pre-seed and seed platform, Atoms, has backed more than 40 companies that have collectively raised over $300 million in follow-on funding. The firm expanded the program this year to include Indian-origin founders based overseas.\nThe latest collaboration comes days after Accel\u2019s partnership with Prosus to co-invest in Atoms X, backing early-stage Indian founders building large-scale solutions with the potential to serve the masses in the country.\nSilber told TechCrunch that Google is not structuring the partnership as a pathway to future acquisitions, or even future cloud customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a sales team, so we\u2019re not specifically looking to sign up new cloud customers. That\u2019s not our goal,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of KPIs, our objective is simply to see the next wave of innovation in the AI space coming out of India.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nX-energy rides nuclear wave, raises $700M Series D\ndescription4:\nNuclear startup X-energy raised $700 million in a Series D round, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe new fundraise comes less than a year after it expanded its Series C from $500 million to $700 million, bringing the total raised in the last year or so to $1.4 billion, a sizable amount even in the heady world of nuclear power startups. X-energy has raised $1.8 billion, to date.\nX-energy said the new infusion will help build the supply chain for its small modular reactors (SMR). So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica.\nThe new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures.\nX-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity.\nLike other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers.\nAmazon\u2019s Climate Pledge Fund led the first installment of the startup\u2019s Series C. The tech company also announced last year it would buy more than 600 megawatts of nuclear capacity in the Pacific Northwest and Virginia, with the reactors coming online in the early 2030s. Altogether, Amazon\u2019s deal with X-energy could see as much as 5 gigawatts deployed by 2039.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.
