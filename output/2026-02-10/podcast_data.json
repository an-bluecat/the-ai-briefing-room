Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country.

Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday February 11), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon may launch a marketplace where media sites can sell their content to AI companies\ndescription0:\nThe AI industry\u2019s pursuit of licensable content has been a messy affair, filled with lawsuits and accusations of copyright infringement. Now, as tech companies look for legally safe sources of AI training data, Amazon is reportedly considering launching a marketplace where publishers can license their content directly to AI companies.\nThe Information reported Monday that the e-commerce giant has been meeting with publishing executives and alerting them to its plans to launch such a marketplace. Ahead of an AWS conference for publishers that occurred Tuesday, Amazon \u201ccirculated slides that mention a content marketplace,\u201d wrote the outlet.\nReached by TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson didn\u2019t deny the story but didn\u2019t directly address the would-be marketplace either, saying only: \u201cAmazon has built long-lasting, innovative relationships with publishers across many areas of our business, including AWS, Retail, Advertising, AGI, and Alexa. We are always innovating together to best serve our customers, but we have nothing specific to share on this subject at this time.\u201d\nAmazon wouldn\u2019t be the first major tech company to take this route. Microsoft recently launched what it calls a Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), which it says will give publishers \u201ca new revenue stream\u201d while also providing AI systems with \u201cscaled access to premium content.\u201d Microsoft added that the PCM was designed to \u201cempower publishers with a transparent economic framework for licensing\u201d their content.\nThe move is a natural next step for the AI industry, which has already sought to solve the legally nebulous problem of how copyrighted material ends up in AI training data by forging deals with major news outlets and media organizations. OpenAI, for instance, has already signed content-licensing partnerships with the Associated Press, Vox Media, News Corp, and The Atlantic, among others.\nThose efforts haven\u2019t been enough to stem the legal fallout. The fight over copyrighted material in AI algorithms has led to a monsoon of lawsuits, and the issue is still being worked out by the judicial system. New regulatory strategies to deal with the issue are being proposed all the time.\nMedia publishers have also fretted about the ways in which AI summaries \u2014 particularly those surfaced by Google in its search results \u2014 may be depressing traffic to their sites. One recent study claimed that such summaries have had a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the number of users clicking through to websites. The Information\u2019s report notes that publishers may view the new marketplace-based content-sharing system as a \u201cmore sustainable business [than current, more limited licensing partnerships] that will scale up revenue\u201d as AI usage continues to escalate.\n\ntitle1:\nFacebook adds new AI features, animated profile photos, and backgrounds for text posts\ndescription1:\nFacebook announced new AI-powered features on Tuesday designed to let users express themselves in more playful ways across the platform. The updates include animated profile pictures, photo-restyling tools for Stories and Memories, and the ability to add animated backgrounds to text posts.\n\u200bAs Meta works to maintain Facebook\u2019s relevance among younger users on its flagship app, it\u2019s likely betting that these new features will deliver a more personalized experience that appeals to Gen Z.\n\u200bThe new animated profile picture feature applies motion effects to static photos, making the subject appear to be waving, making a heart shape, or wearing a virtual party hat. To achieve the best results, Facebook recommends using a clear photo of a single person facing the camera. Photos can be pulled directly from a user\u2019s camera roll or from images already on the platform. The company also plans to add more animation options throughout the year.\nImage Credits:Facebook\n\u200bFacebook is also enhancing its Stories \u2014 short photo and video posts that disappear after 24 hours \u2014 and Memories \u2014 a feature that resurfaces posts from the same date in previous years \u2014 with \u201cRestyle,\u201d a tool that uses Meta AI to reimagine the look of user-uploaded images.\nAfter uploading a photo to Stories or selecting a Memory to share, users can tap Restyle and either enter a text-based prompt or select from preset themes, including anime, illustrated, glowy, ethereal, and more. There are also options to adjust moods, lighting, and colors, and to swap in new backdrops such as a beach or a cityscape.\n\u200bTo spice up text posts, Facebook is also gradually rolling out animated backgrounds. By clicking on the new rainbow \u201cA\u201d icon, users can choose from a variety of still and animated scenes, such as falling leaves or rolling ocean waves, to make their posts stand out in the feed. The company says that seasonal backgrounds are coming soon.\nImage Credits:Facebook\n\u200bWith around 2.1 billion daily active users, Facebook remains a social media giant. However, in recent years, it has struggled to attract and retain a younger demographic.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Other recent updates include a friends-only feed and the ability to use unique display names within Groups, similar to how Reddit handles usernames in its communities. The platform is also attempting to make its poke feature \u2014 a way to tap another user on the shoulder, so to speak \u2014 relevant again by launching a new dedicated button on users\u2019 profiles that alerts the recipient to a poke via notifications.\n\ntitle2:\nYouTube rolls out an AI playlist generator for Premium users\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nYouTube is rolling out a new AI-powered playlist-generation feature that allows Premium users on iOS and Android to use text prompts to create playlists.\nUsers can go to the Library tab, tap the \u201cNew\u201d button, and select the \u201cAI playlist\u201d option to get started.

Select \u201cAI\u2026 pic.twitter.com/YR1GVCqwvu \u2014 Updates From YouTube (@UpdatesFromYT) February 9, 2026\nYouTube has been toying around with using AI to create playlists for a while. In July 2024, the company was testing a feature to let people create custom radio stations using prompts in the U.S.\nOther rival streaming services like Spotify, Amazon Music, and Deezer have also rolled out AI-powered playlist or radio creation features.\nYouTube has been trying to make its Premium plan more attractive to users. Earlier this week, the company started restricting free users from viewing song lyrics on the YouTube Music app. The company told TechCrunch that the restriction was an experiment it was running \u201cwith a small percentage of ad-supported users\u201d and that song lyrics are available to the vast majority of free users.\nGoogle has seen an uptick in its subscription business, and YouTube is a key part of that division. Earlier this month, the company said it now has 325 million paying users across Google One and YouTube Premium.\n\ntitle3:\nOkay, now exactly half of xAI's founding team has left the company\ndescription3:\nMonday night, xAI co-founder Yuhuai (Tony) Wu announced he was leaving the company. \u201cIt\u2019s time for my next chapter,\u201d Wu wrote in a late-night post on X. \u201cIt is an era with full possibilities: a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what\u2019s possible.\u201d\nLess than a day later, on Tuesday afternoon, xAI co-founder Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said that he, too, is bouncing, posting a gracious note on X on his way out. \u201cEnormous thanks to @elonmusk for bringing us together on this incredible journey. So proud of what the xAI team has done and will continue to stay close as a friend of the team,\u201d it read in part.\nOn their own, both were pretty standard tech departure announcements \u2014 but they\u2019re part of a troubling pattern for the lab. Six members of the company\u2019s 12-person founding team have now left the company, with five of the departures coming in just the last year. Infrastructure lead Kyle Kosic left for OpenAI in mid-2024, followed by Google veteran Christian Szegedy in February 2025. This past August, Igor Babuschkin left to found a venture firm, and Microsoft alum Greg Yang departed just last month, citing health issues.\nBy all accounts, the splits have all been amicable, and there are lots of reasons why, nearly three years in, some founders might decide to move on. Elon Musk is a notoriously demanding boss, and with the SpaceX\u2019s acquisition of xAI complete and an IPO pending in the coming months, everyone involved has a pretty big windfall coming. It\u2019s a great time to be fundraising for an AI startup, so it\u2019s only natural for high-level researchers to want to strike out on their own.\nThere are also less amicable reasons that might factor in. The company\u2019s flagship product, the Grok chatbot, has struggled with bizarre behavior and apparent internal tampering \u2014 the kind of thing that might easily create friction on the technical team. Then there were the recent changes to xAI\u2019s image-generation tools that flooded the platform with deepfake pornography, sparking slow-moving but real legal consequences.\nWhatever the cause, the cumulative impact is alarming. There is a lot of work left to do at xAI, and an IPO will bring more scrutiny than the lab has ever faced before. With Musk already spinning up plans for orbital data centers, the pressure to make good on those plans will be intense. The pace of model development isn\u2019t slowing down, and if Grok can\u2019t keep pace with the latest models from OpenAI and Anthropic, the IPO could easily suffer.\nIn short, the stakes are high, and xAI needs to hold on to all the AI talent it can.\n\ntitle4:\nWith co-founders leaving and an IPO looming, Elon Musk turns talk to the moon\ndescription4:\nOn Tuesday night, Elon Musk gathered the employees of xAI for an all-hands meeting. Evidently, he wanted to talk about the future of his AI company, and specifically, how it relates to the moon.\nAccording to The New York Times, which reports that it heard the meeting, Musk told employees that xAI needs a lunar manufacturing facility, a factory on the moon that will build AI satellites and fling them into space via a giant catapult. \u201cYou have to go to the moon,\u201d he said, per the Times. The move, he explained, will help xAI harness more computing power than any rival. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,\u201d he added, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.\u201d\nWhat Musk didn\u2019t appear to address clearly was how any of this would be built, or how he plans to reorganize the newly merged xAI-SpaceX entity that is simultaneously careening toward a potentially historic IPO. He did acknowledge, proudly, that the company is in flux. \u201cIf you\u2019re moving faster than anyone else in any given technology arena, you will be the leader,\u201d he told employees, per the Times, \u201cand xAI is moving faster than any other company \u2014 no one\u2019s even close.\u201d He added that \u201cwhen this happens, there\u2019s some people who are better suited for the early stages of a company and less suited for the later stages.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t clear what prompted the all-hands, but the timing, whatever its cause, is at least curious. On Monday night, xAI co-founder Tony Wu announced he was leaving. Less than a day later, another xAI co-founder, Jimmy Ba, who reported directly to Musk, said he was bouncing, too. That brings the total to six of xAI\u2019s 12 founding members who have now left the young company. The splits have all been described as copacetic, and with a SpaceX IPO reportedly targeting a $1.5 trillion valuation coming as soon as this summer, everyone involved stands to do very well financially on their way out the door.\nThe moon itself is a more recent preoccupation. For most of SpaceX\u2019s 24-year existence, Mars was the end game. This past Sunday, just before the Super Bowl, Musk surprised many, posting that SpaceX had \u201cshifted focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon,\u201d arguing that a Mars colony would take \u201c20+ years.\u201d The moon, he said, could get there in half the time.\nIt\u2019s a pretty big change in direction for a company that has never sent a mission to the moon.\nRationally or otherwise, investors do seem considerably more excited about data centers in orbit than about colonies on other planets. (Even for the most patient money in the room, that\u2019s a long timeline.) But to at least one venture backer in xAI who talked with this editor last year, the lunar ambitions have nothing to do with Wall Street and aren\u2019t a distraction from xAI\u2019s core mission; they\u2019re inseparable from it.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe theory, laid out by the VC at the time, is that Musk has been building toward a single goal from the beginning: the world\u2019s most powerful world model, an AI trained not just on text and images but on proprietary real-world data that no competitor can replicate. Tesla contributes energy systems and road topology. Neuralink offers a window into the brain. SpaceX provides physics and orbital mechanics. The Boring Company adds some subsurface data. Add a moon factory to the mix and you start to see the outline of something very powerful.\nWhether that vision is achievable is a very big question. Another is whether it is legal. Under the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, no nation \u2014 and by extension, no company \u2014 can claim sovereignty over the moon. But a 2015 U.S. law opened a significant loophole \u2014 while you can\u2019t own the moon, you can own whatever you extract from it. As Mary-Jane Rubenstein, a professor of science and technology studies at Wesleyan University, explained to TechCrunch last month, the distinction is somewhat illusory. \u201cIt\u2019s more like saying you can\u2019t own the house, but you can have the floorboards and the beams,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the stuff that is in the moon is the moon.\u201d\nThat legal framework is the scaffolding on which Musk\u2019s moon ambitions apparently rest, even as not everyone has agreed to play by those rules (China and Russia certainly have not). Meanwhile, as the team that was supposed to help him get there keeps getting smaller, it isn\u2019t clear who will be helping him on this adventure or whether, more immediately, his newest all-hands answered more questions than it raised.\"\n\nResponse:",
