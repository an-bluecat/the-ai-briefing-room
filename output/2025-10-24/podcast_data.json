For instance, with a Spotify integration, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app.\nTo get started, make sure you\u2019re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account.\nIf you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it\u2019ll take you to the sign-in page for each one.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that connecting your account means you\u2019re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you\u2019re giving when you\u2019re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you\u2019re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.)\nYou can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu.\nAvailable apps\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nBooking.com\nThis integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay.\nOnce you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget. You can also specify how many people are coming and whether you want the hotel near public transport. ChatGPT aims to make this process more intuitive than searching directly on the Booking.com site. Plus, you can be more specific, like searching for options \u201cwith breakfast included.\u201d\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWhen you find a hotel you like, just open the Booking.com listing to complete your reservation.\nCanva\nImage Credits:Canva\nCanva in ChatGPT is a helpful tool for graphic designers and anyone else who needs to generate visual content quickly. Whether it\u2019s for a social media post, a poster, or a slide deck for a presentation, this may be a good way to help kickstart your project and brainstorm ideas.\nOnce you connect your Canva account, you can ask ChatGPT to design something like \u201ca 16:9 slide deck about our Q4 roadmap\u201d or \u201ca fun poster for a dog-walking business.\u201d You can include specifics such as the fonts you prefer, color schemes, formats (like Instagram posts or stories), and exact dimensions.\nAI-generated designs are seldom perfect, with occasional distorted images or spelling mistakes. However, some users may find this better than starting from scratch, and they can jump into Canva at any time to tweak their design and make it look just how they want.\nCoursera\nImage Credits:Coursera\nCoursera\u2019s integration is designed to help you quickly discover the best online courses for your skill level. For instance, you can then tell ChatGPT to find an \u201cintermediate-level course on Python.\u201d You can then tell the chatbot to compare course options by rating, duration, and cost before enrolling. ChatGPT can also provide a quick rundown of what exactly each course covers.\nExpedia\nImage Credits:Expedia\nChatGPT can display hotel options and flights via Expedia without leaving chat. Whether you\u2019re looking for a quick escape or a longer trip, it can find flights that fit your travel dates, budget, and number of travelers. You can narrow things down by saying stuff like \u201cOnly show 4-star hotels.\u201d Once you see something you like, go to Expedia to finalize everything and book your trip.\nFigma\nImage Credits:Figma\nTo use Figma in ChatGPT, you can ask it to generate diagrams, flow charts, and more. This is helpful for turning your ideas and brainstorming sessions into something more tangible. It may also be useful for visualizing complex concepts or workflows.\nYou can also upload files and ask the chatbot to generate a product roadmap for your team. This roadmap can include milestones, deliverables, and deadlines, helping your team stay organized and focused on their goals.\nSpotify\nImage Credits:Spotify\nOne of the most helpful aspects of using Spotify in ChatGPT is the ability to quickly create playlists and listen to new recommended songs tailored to your specific tastes. You can ask it to create a playlist based on your current mood, or just a playlist that only includes tracks by your favorite band.\nIt can also suggest new artists, playlists, audiobooks, and podcast episodes. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform actions on your behalf, including adding and removing items from your Spotify library.\nZillow\nImage Credits:Zillow\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new home, Zillow in ChatGPT could make the search experience more straightforward. Using a simple text prompt, you can find homes that meet your criteria and apply filters to narrow the results. Whether you\u2019re looking for a specific price range, number of bedrooms, or particular neighborhoods, you can specify these details in your prompt, making the search process much more efficient and tailored to your needs.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nAlongside the announcement that OpenAI would bring apps into ChatGPT, the company also said it plans to welcome additional partners soon, including DoorDash, OpenTable, Target, Uber, and Walmart. These will launch later in the year.\nThe rollout of ChatGPT\u2019s app integrations is currently limited to the U.S. and Canada. Users in Europe and the U.K. are excluded for now.\n\ntitle2:\nEC finds Meta and TikTok breached transparency rules under DSA\ndescription2:\nAn investigation by EU regulators has found TikTok and Meta in breach of the Union\u2019s rules concerning illegal or harmful online content.\nThe European Commission (EC) said on Friday that preliminary findings show both companies are not complying with Digital Services Act (DSA) rules that require them to give researchers adequate access to public data.\nThe Commission called Meta and TikTok\u2019s procedures and tools for requesting access to public data \u201cburdensome,\u201d saying that researchers are consequently often left with partial or unreliable data, which affects \u201ctheir ability to conduct research, such as whether users, including minors, are exposed to illegal or harmful content.\u201d\nThe Commission also said Meta\u2019s platforms \u2014 Instagram and Facebook \u2014 were both in breach of obligations to provide EU residents with simple ways to report illegal content. The Commission said both platforms impose several unnecessary steps before users can report content, and accused Facebook and Instagram of using so-called \u201cdark patterns\u201d \u2014 design tricks that manipulate users into taking certain actions.\n\u201cSuch practices can be confusing and dissuading. Meta\u2019s mechanisms to flag and remove illegal content may therefore be ineffective,\u201d the Commission wrote in a statement.\nThe EC also said both Meta platforms\u2019 moderation appeal mechanisms don\u2019t allow EU residents to fully explain or provide evidence to support their appeals. \u201cThis makes it difficult for users in the EU to further explain why they disagree with Meta\u2019s content decision, limiting the effectiveness of the appeals mechanism,\u201d the Commission wrote.\nTikTok says it has made \u201csubstantial investments\u201d in data sharing and has given access to data to nearly 1,000 research teams via its research tools. \u201cWe are reviewing the European Commission\u2019s findings, but requirements to ease data safeguards place the DSA and GDPR in direct tension. If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\u201d a TikTok spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nMeanwhile, Meta claimed it has made changes to its tools and processes to comply with DSA requirements. \u201cWe disagree with any suggestion that we have breached the DSA, and we continue to negotiate with the European Commission on these matters. In the European Union, we have introduced changes to our content reporting options, appeals process, and data access tools since the DSA came into force and are confident that these solutions match what is required under the law in the EU,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said.\nThe findings are part of investigations launched into both companies early in 2024. The EC had started looking into TikTok with a focus on advertising transparency, data access for researchers, content moderation, and protection of minors, as well as other concerns. The investigation into Meta was launched after the Commission said it suspected Facebook and Instagram of breaking rules for larger platforms concerning election integrity.\nThe DSA is the EU\u2019s set of rules governing online platforms and content moderation, which broadly addresses concerns over rising risks for consumer welfare in the digital realm. The law imposes a set of extra requirements on big platforms like TikTok and Meta in areas like algorithmic transparency and systemic risk.\nPenalties for confirmed breaches of the DSA can reach up to 6% of global annual revenue.\nThe EC said Meta and TikTok both will be able to review its investigation documents, challenge the findings, and commit to address them.\nNote: This story was updated to add comments from TikTok and Meta.\n\ntitle3:\nAutomattic files counterclaims against WP Engine in WordPress lawsuit, alleging trademark misuse\ndescription3:\nOn Friday, WordPress.com maker Automattic filed its counterclaims in the lawsuit initiated by hosting company WP Engine in October 2024, which had accused Automattic and its CEO, Matt Mullenweg, of defamation and abuse of power. Automattic believes that WP Engine has been abusing the WordPress trademark and has engaged in deceptive marketing practices, without properly giving back to the open source community.\nAs a result, Automattic took action against WP Engine last year, which included calling the hosting provider a \u201ccancer to WordPress\u201d and sending it a cease-and-desist letter claiming WP Engine had breached its trademark usage rules. As the battle continued, Automattic banned WP Engine from accessing WordPress.org resources and attempted to negotiate a licensing deal with the host. Automattic claims that the company strung it along, negotiating in bad faith.\nWP Engine eventually sued Automattic, portraying itself as the victim of Mullenweg\u2019s attacks. But in Automattic\u2019s telling of events, after the private equity firm Silver Lake invested $250 million in WP Engine, it shifted from fair use to trademark infringement by calling itself \u201cThe WordPress Technology Company\u201d and letting its partners refer to it as \u201cWordPress Engine.\u201d\nAutomattic notes that the hosting company also launched products with names like \u201cCore WordPress\u201d and \u201cHeadless WordPress,\u201d and claimed to its customers that it had committed 5% of its resources to support the WordPress ecosystem. Automattic says it never kept those promises. Automattic alleges that the trademark infringement was deliberate, saying WP Engine only \u201cpretended to engage in licensing discussions, but actually delayed and negotiated in bad faith.\u201d\nSilver Lake plays a central role in the counterclaims, which imply that the interests of the private equity firm guided much of WP Engine\u2019s behavior. In particular, the counterclaims allege that WP Engine engaged in trademark violations because paying licensing fees would impact the company\u2019s earnings and valuation, and therefore, Silver Lake\u2019s expected return.\nThe counterclaims also allege that Silver Lake was seeking to offload WP Engine at a $2 billion valuation, but couldn\u2019t find a buyer. Notably, the filing says that this included \u201covertures to Automattic.\u201d\nAutomattic also claims that WP Engine degraded the consumer experience and product quality in an attempt to cut costs during this time by removing essential features.\nWP Engine responded to the counterclaims with the following statement:\n\u201cWP Engine\u2019s use of the WordPress trademark to refer to the open-source software is consistent with longstanding industry practice and fair use under settled trademark law, and we will defend against these baseless claims.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
