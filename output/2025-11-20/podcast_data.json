Joby alleges Kivork, who was hired by Archer, stole trade secrets that were then used by Archer.\nIn the lawsuit, Joby alleges that two days before announcing his resignation, Kivork \u201cexfiltrated a cache of highly valuable Joby filings containing confidential partnerships terms, business and regulatory strategies, infrastructure strategies for vertiports and airport access, and technical information about Joby\u2019s aircraft and operations,\u201d the complaint states.\nJoby claims Archer approached one of its strategic partners and shared detailed information about confidential terms of its exclusive agreement with Joby. According to the complaint, this information was known to Kivork and contained in the files he allegedly stole.\n\u201cThis is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cKivork and Archer\u2019s behavior has left Joby with no choice but to bring this action to protect Joby\u2019s valuable confidential and proprietary information.\u201d\nArcher was quick to strike back.\n\u201cJoby is turning to baseless litigation in an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings and slow down its leading competitor,\u201d Eric Lentell, Archer\u2019s chief legal and strategy officer, said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.\n\u201cJoby\u2019s case is entirely without merit. The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation,\u201d said Lentell. \u201cAs Joby knows, Archer has implemented rigorous employee onboarding procedures to prevent against the very thing it is accused of. Joby is improperly attempting to weaponize the legal system to achieve through bad faith litigation what it cannot accomplish through fair competition. Archer remains focused on building the future of advanced aviation in America.\u201d\nArcher Aviation and Joby are both based in California and went public in 2021 via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. Both are developing electric air taxis as well as pursuing defense applications to its technology.\nFor instance, Archer signed an exclusive deal with weapons manufacturer Anduril earlier this year to jointly develop a hybrid gas-and-electric-powered vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft for critical defense applications. Meanwhile, Joby signed an agreement with defense contractor L3Harris Technologies to \u201cexplore opportunities\u201d to develop a gas-turbine hybrid VTOL aircraft that can fly autonomously.\nThe lawsuit puts the two competitors on a far more combative path.\nArcher has been in the legal hot seat before, although that was ultimately settled.\nWisk, which is now a subsidiary of Boeing, sued Archer in 2021 for \u201cbrazen theft\u201d of confidential information and intellectual property. Those files included over 50 trade secrets that Wisk alleged were stolen by a former employee who was later hired by Archer. The lawsuit dragged on for two years before the parties settled the legal dispute and agreed to collaborate.\n\ntitle1:\nSalesforce says some of its customers' data was accessed after Gainsight breach\ndescription1:\nSalesforce said on Wednesday that it\u2019s investigating a breach of \u201ccertain customers\u2019 Salesforce data\u201d that was compromised through apps published by Gainsight, a company that sells a platform for other companies to manage their customers.\nIn a notice published late Wednesday, Salesforce said the hacks involve \u201cGainsight-published applications connected to Salesforce, which are installed and managed directly by customers.\u201d\nSalesforce said that there is \u201cno indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,\u201d and that the activity appears related to Gainsight\u2019s \u201cexternal connection to Salesforce.\u201d\nWhen reached for comment, Salesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda referred TechCrunch to the company\u2019s page dedicated to the incident.\nContact Us Do you have more information about these Salesforce and Gainsight data breaches?

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe prolific hacking group ShinyHunters told cybersecurity news website DataBreaches.net that it was behind the breach, adding that if Salesforce doesn\u2019t negotiate with them, they will create a new website to advertise the stolen data \u2014 a common extortion tactic by financially-motivated cybercriminals.\n\u201cThe next [data leak site] will contain the data of the Salesloft and GainSight campaigns,\u201d the hackers told DataBreaches.net. The hackers claim to have stolen data from close to a thousand companies.\nThis data breach appears similar to an August breach at AI marketing chatbot maker Salesloft, which allowed the hackers to break into a number of their customers\u2019 connected Salesforce instances to steal sensitive data, such as access tokens for other services. Among the victims included insurance giant Allianz Life, Bugcrowd, Cloudflare, Google, fashion conglomerate Kering, Proofpoint, the airline Qantas, carmaker Stellantis, credit bureau TransUnion, the employee management platform Workday, and others.\nIn the case of the Salesloft breaches, the hacking group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which apparently includes the ShinyHunters gang, claimed responsibility.\nLast month, the hackers launched a dedicated website to extort the victims of the breaches, where they threatened to release a billion records.\nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of the Salesloft-linked breaches, but it\u2019s unclear if this new wave of hacks originated from its earlier compromise.\n\ntitle2:\nChatGPT launches group chats globally\ndescription2:\nChatGPT is launching group chats globally to all users on Free, Go, Plus, and Pro plans, OpenAI announced on Thursday. The move comes a week after the company began piloting the feature in select regions, including Japan and New Zealand.\nThe feature allows users to collaborate with each other and ChatGPT in one shared conversation. OpenAI says the launch turns ChatGPT from a one-on-one assistant into a space where friends, family, or co-workers can work together to plan, create, and make decisions.\nThe company sees group chats in ChatGPT as a way for people to coordinate trips, co-write documents, settle debates, or work through research together, while ChatGPT helps search, summarize, and compare options.\nUp to 20 people can participate in a group chat as long as they\u2019ve accepted an invite. Personal settings and memory stay private to each user, the company says.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTo start a group chat, users need to tap the people icon and add participants, either directly or by sharing a link. Everyone will be asked to set up a short profile with their name, username, and photo.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that adding someone to an existing chat creates a new conversation, leaving the original chat unchanged.\nOpenAI says ChatGPT knows when to jump in and when to stay quiet during a group conversation. Users can tag \u201cChatGPT\u201d to get it to respond. Plus, ChatGPT can react to messages with emojis, and reference profile photos.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe move marks OpenAI\u2019s latest step in turning ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into more of a social platform. OpenAI says group chats are just the beginning of ChatGPT becoming a collaborative environment, not just a single-player experience.\n\u201cOver time, we see ChatGPT playing a more active role in real group conversations, helping people plan, create, and take action together,\u201d the company wrote in an email to TechCrunch.\nThursday\u2019s announcement comes less than two weeks after the launch of GPT\u20115.1, which featured both Instant and Thinking versions of the model. In September, OpenAI launched a social app called Sora, where users can generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed.\n\ntitle3:\nUber Eats will use Starship sidewalk robots to deliver food in the UK\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nUber Eats is partnering with sidewalk delivery robot company Starship Technologies to deliver food in the U.K. starting later this year.\nThe companies will start the service in the Leeds and Sheffield areas \u201cfrom select merchants\u201d in December and expand from there. Uber said the service will expand to \u201cadditional European markets in 2026\u201d and the U.S. in 2027.\nThe tie-up with Starship is the latest in an increasingly long line of partnerships Uber has struck with autonomous vehicle companies of all shapes and sizes. But Starship\u2019s not the first sidewalk robot company to work with Uber Eats. Uber\u2019s food delivery arm has used Serve Robotics\u2019 robots for a few years in the U.S. Uber started using Avride\u2019s sidewalk robots earlier this year, too.\nStarship claims to have nearly 3,000 of its six-wheeled delivery robots in operation around the world, across more than 270 different locations. The robots typically make deliveries in under 30 minutes and travel no more than two miles.\n\ntitle4:\nSource: Kalshi's valuation jumps to $11B after raising massive $1B round\ndescription4:\nKalshi, a prediction market that allows people to bet on future events, has raised a massive $1 billion round at a $11 billion valuation, according to a person familiar with the deal. The round comes less than two months after the seven-year-old startup announced its previous fundraise of $300 million at a $5 billion valuation.\nThe latest round is led by the company\u2019s returning investors Sequoia and CapitalG, the person said. Other investors in Kalshi include Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, Anthos Capital, and Neo.\nKalshi and Sequoia declined to comment. CapitalG didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment.\nKalshi\u2019s main rival, Polymarket, was reportedly in talks last month to raise another funding round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, mere weeks after closing a $1 billion round at an $8 billion pre-money valuation, Bloomberg reported.\nKalshi and Polymarket surged in popularity last year after both prediction markets allowed people to bet on the outcome of the presidential election. These betting sites became even more prominent after they correctly predicted the results of New York City\u2019s mayoral election earlier this month.\nFor the Mamdani versus Cuomo race, Kalshi purchased ad space on New York subway cars, running live screens that displayed the up-to-the-minute odds of each candidate winning, a marketing campaign that undoubtedly raised the company\u2019s brand awareness among New Yorkers.\nKalshi allows people in over 140 countries to bet on various future events, ranging from who Time magazine will name Person of the Year for 2025 and the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film Wicked, to outcomes further in the future, like the next U.S. presidential election winner.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nIn mid-October, the company reached $50 billion in annualized trading volume, marking a more than a thousandfold increase from the approximately $300 million volume posted last year, the New York Times reported.\nKalshi was co-founded by two former hedge fund traders, Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara. The duo met as undergraduate students at MIT while studying computer science and mathematics.\nPrediction markets have historically been controversial and subject to legal challenges because they operate in the gray area between financial instruments and traditional gambling.\nWhile Kalshi has secured the right for Americans to use its platform after successfully suing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) last year, the company is currently engaged in legal disputes with numerous state regulators who claim its activities are illegal gambling.\nPolymarket has been barred from serving U.S. residents since 2022, following a settlement with the CFTC. In July, the company acquired a derivatives exchange and a clearinghouse. The move helped Polymarket receive the right to reenter the U.S. market. In September, the company\u2019s CEO and founder, Shayne Coplan, said on X: \u201cPolymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the CFTC.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
