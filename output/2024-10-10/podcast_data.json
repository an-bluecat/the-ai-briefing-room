The design was futuristic, with doors that open upward like butterfly wings and a small cabin with only enough space for two passengers. There was no steering wheel or pedals, nor was there a plug \u2014 Musk said the vehicle inductive charging to regain power wirelessly.\nMusk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehicles\nMusk said that autonomous cars are expected to be 10-20 times safer than human-driven vehicles and could cost as low as $0.20 per mile, compared to the $1 per mile for city buses.\nTesla plans to launch fully autonomous driving in Texas and California next year, with the Cybercab production by 2026 \u2014 although he said it could be as late as 2027. Additionally, Tesla is developing the Optimus robot, which could be available for $20,000-$30,000, and is capable of performing various tasks.\n\u201cThis is a very big deal,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt\u2019ll save lives, a lot of lives, and prevent injuries.\u201d\nMusk revealed the prototype robotaxi at Tesla\u2019s \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event held at the Warner Bros. film lot in Burbank, California, with a lot of non-public roads for the demonstration. Tesla has reportedly been mapping the area in advance of the demonstration, even though the company says it doesn\u2019t rely on high-definition maps to power its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assist feature.\nMusk is attempting to steer Tesla away from its core business of making and selling EVs toward one that produces robots and AI. Tesla\u2019s market cap is equal to almost all the other global automaker\u2019s value combined. Much of the company\u2019s stock price is based on Musk\u2019s yearslong promise to solve autonomy by releasing a truly revolutionary vehicle that can drive itself anywhere it wants.\nWhether Tesla\u2019s robotaxi will accomplish that steep task is anyone\u2019s guess. Musk has a reputation for defying the odds, but AV experts have routinely questioned Tesla\u2019s approach to the technology, especially with regard to the company\u2019s aggressive push for Level 2 advanced driver-assist systems like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (Supervised).\nPrevious Next\n1 / 11 Previous Next\n1 / 11\nBut Musk has a track record of coming from behind to pull off impossible victories. The Model 3 production and the early success of the Cybertruck are two recent examples of Musk defying expectations.\n\u201cThink about the cumulative time that people spend in a car\u201d\nDuring the event, Musk pitched the idea of autonomous cars as primarily a time-saver. \u201cThink about the cumulative time that people spend in a car,\u201d he said, \u201cand the time they will get back that they can now spend on their books or watching a movie or doing work or whatever.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nAMD launches AI chip to rival Nvidia's Blackwell\ndescription1:\nLisa Su, chairwoman and CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), delivers the opening keynote speech at Computex 2024, Taiwan's premier tech expo, in Taipei on June 3, 2024.\nAMD launched a new artificial intelligence chip on Thursday that is taking direct aim at Nvidia's data center graphics processors, known as GPUs.\nThe Instinct MI325X, as the chip is called, will start production before the end of 2024, AMD said Thursday during an event announcing the new product. If AMD's AI chips are seen by developers and cloud giants as a close substitute for Nvidia's products, it could put pricing pressure on Nvidia, which has enjoyed roughly 75% gross margins while its GPUs have been in high demand over the past year.\nAdvanced generative AI such as OpenAI's ChatGPT requires massive data centers full of GPUs in order to do the necessary processing, which has created demand for more companies to provide AI chips.\nIn the past few years, Nvidia has dominated the majority of the data center GPU market, but AMD is historically in second place. Now, AMD is aiming to take share from its Silicon Valley rival or at least to capture a big chunk of the market, which it says will be worth $500 billion by 2028.\n\"AI demand has actually continued to take off and actually exceed expectations. It's clear that the rate of investment is continuing to grow everywhere,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su said at the event.\nAMD didn't reveal new major cloud or internet customers for its Instinct GPUs at the event, but the company has previously disclosed that both Meta and Microsoft buy its AI GPUs and that OpenAI uses them for some applications. The company also did not disclose pricing for the Instinct MI325X, which is typically sold as part of a complete server.\nWith the launch of the MI325X, AMD is accelerating its product schedule to release new chips on an annual schedule to better compete with Nvidia and take advantage of the boom in AI chips. The new AI chip is the successor to the MI300X, which started shipping late last year. AMD's 2025 chip will be called MI350, and its 2026 chip will be called MI400, the company said.\nThe MI325X's rollout will pit it against Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell chips, which Nvidia has said will start shipping in significant quantities early next year.\nA successful launch for AMD's newest data center GPU could draw interest from investors that are looking for additional companies that are in line to benefit from the AI boom. AMD is only up 20% so far in 2024 while Nvidia's stock has risen over 175%. Most industry estimates say Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for data center AI chips.\nAMD's stock fell 4% on Thursday. Nvidia shares were up about 1%.\nAMD's biggest obstacle in taking market share is that its rival's chips use their own programming language, CUDA, which has become standard among AI developers. That essentially locks developers into Nvidia's ecosystem.\nIn response, AMD this week said that it has been improving its competing software, called ROCm, so that AI developers can easily switch more of their AI models over to AMD's chips, which it calls accelerators.\nAMD has framed its AI accelerators as more competitive for use cases where AI models are creating content or making predictions rather than when an AI model is processing terabytes of data to improve. That's partially due to the advanced memory AMD is using on its chip, it said, which allows it to serve Meta's Llama AI model faster than some Nvidia chips.\n\"What you see is that MI325 platform delivers up to 40% more inference performance than the H200 on Llama 3.1,\" said Su, referring to Meta's large language AI model.\nTaking on Intel, too\nWhile AI accelerators and GPUs have become the most intensely watched part of the semiconductor industry, AMD's core business has been central processors, or CPUs, that lay at the heart of nearly every server in the world.\nAMD's data center sales during the June quarter more than doubled in the past year to $2.8 billion, with AI chips accounting for only about $1 billion, the company said in July.\nAMD takes about 34% of total dollars spent on data center CPUs, the company said. That's still less than Intel , which remains the boss of the market with its Xeon line of chips. AMD is aiming to change that with a new line of CPUs, called EPYC 5th Gen, that it also announced Thursday.\nThose chips come in a number of different configurations ranging from a low-cost and low-power 8-core chip that costs $527 to 192-core, 500-watt processors intended for supercomputers that cost $14,813 per chip.\nThe new CPUs are particularly good for feeding data into AI workloads, AMD said. Nearly all GPUs require a CPU on the same system in order to boot up the computer.\n\"Today's AI is really about CPU capability, and you see that in data analytics and a lot of those types of applications,\" Su said.\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft announces new health-care AI tools\ndescription2:\nIn this article MSFT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nMicrosoft on Thursday announced new health-care data and artificial intelligence tools, including a collection of medical imaging models, a health-care agent service and an automated documentation solution for nurses. The tools aim to help health-care organizations build AI applications quicker and save clinicians time on administrative tasks, a major cause of industry burnout. Nurses spend as much as 41% of their time on documentation, according to a report from the Office of the Surgeon General. \"By integrating AI into health care, our goal is to reduce the strain on medical staff, foster the collective health team collaboration, enhance the overall efficiency of healthcare systems across the country,\" Mary Varghese Presti, vice president of portfolio evolution and incubation at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences, said in a prerecorded briefing with reporters. The new tools are the latest example of Microsoft's efforts to establish itself as a leader in health-care AI. Last October, the company unveiled a series of health features across its Azure cloud and Fabric analytics platform. It also acquired Nuance Communications, which offers speech-to-text AI solutions for health care and other sectors, in a $16 billion deal in 2021. Many of the solutions Microsoft announced on Thursday are in the early stages of development or only available in preview. Health-care organizations will test and validate them before the company rolls them out more broadly. Microsoft declined to share what these new tools will cost. Health-care AI models\nMicrosoft's model catalog Courtesy of Microsoft\nRoughly 80% of hospital and health system visits include an imaging exam because doctors often rely on images to help treat patients. Microsoft is launching a collection of open-source multimodal AI models that can analyze data types beyond just text, such as medical images, clinical records and genomic data. Health-care organizations can use the models to build new applications and tools. For example, digitizing a single pathology slide can require more than a gigabyte of storage, so many existing AI pathology models have trained on small pieces of slides at a time. Microsoft and Providence Health & Services built a whole-slide model that improves on mutation prediction and cancer subtyping, according to a paper published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature. Now, health systems can build on it and fine-tune it to meet their needs. \"Getting a whole-slide foundation model for pathology has been a challenge in the past \u2026 and now we're actually able to do it,\" Sara Vaezy, chief strategy and digital officer at Providence, told CNBC in an interview. \"It was really sort of a game changer.\" The models are available in the model catalog within Azure AI Studio, which serves as Microsoft's generative AI development hub. Health-care agent service\nMicrosoft's health-care agent service. Courtesy of Microsoft\nMicrosoft also announced a new way for health systems to build AI agents. AI agents vary in complexity, but they can help users answer questions, automate processes and perform specific tasks. Through Microsoft Copilot Studio, these organizations can create agents equipped with health-care-specific safeguards. When an answer contains a reference to clinical evidence, for instance, the source is shown, and a note indicates if the answer is AI-generated. Fabrications and omissions are also flagged, Microsoft said. For example, a health-care organization could build an AI agent to help doctors identify relevant clinical trials for a patient. Microsoft said a physician could type the question, \"What clinical trials for a male 55-year-old with diabetes and interstitial lung disease?\" and receive a list of potential options. It would save the doctor the time and effort of finding each trial. AI agents that can help patients answer basic questions have been popular among the health systems that have already begun testing the service, Hadas Bitran, general manager of health AI at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences, said in a Q&A with reporters. Agents that can help doctors answer questions about recent guidelines and patients' history are also common, she added. Microsoft's health-care agent service is available in a preview capacity starting Thursday.

Manuel Orbegozo | Reuters\nWhen Facebook changed its name to Meta in October 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg used the occasion to show the world his vision of a digital future of work and recreation accessible through a virtual reality headset. The company soon opened its play universe called Horizon Worlds, featuring floating personalized avatars. As the rebranding to Meta approaches its third anniversary, none of that stuff has gone mainstream. But the company appears to have found its footing in virtual and augmented reality through a different medium. After achieving surprise early success in the smart glasses market through a partnership with Ray-Ban, Meta is ginning up excitement for the prototype of a much more advanced pair of glasses called Orion, a project nearly a decade in the making. Zuckerberg's reveal of Orion late last month has triggered a level of enthusiasm that's unfamiliar in the metaverse. The triumphant demo, at Meta's annual Connect event, was a relief to many employees and represented an internal shift in sentiment toward Zuckerberg's costly hardware ambitions, according to people close to the company who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press on the matter. At the start of the demo, Zuckerberg pulled the device out of a locked metal briefcase. He showed off the gadget \u2014 a pair of black, thick-framed AR glasses \u2014 to the live audience before placing it on his face. Orion comes with a wireless puck that allows it to run holographic virtual images on top of what users see in real life. It also relies on a wristband that picks up on a user's neural signals to let them control the device. The demo was seamless. The crowd oohed and aahed. Rave product reviews followed from the few who got to test it. CNBC's Julia Boorstin described a call she had with her producer, saying, \"It was like I was FaceTiming with him but he was in my glasses.\" The Verge's Alex Heath played Zuckerberg in a game of Pong and wrote that he \"noticed little to no lag in the game.\" \"The right way to look at Orion is as a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said at Connect. \"These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\nwatch now\nFollowing the Orion showcase, Meta is preparing to strengthen its relationship with software developers as it works toward building a consumer version of the device, and to pushing its current generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to more consumers for the 2024 holiday shopping season. The company is also looking at ways to bring the technology developed for the Orion wristband to its other consumer devices, notably the Quest VR headsets and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to a person familiar with the matter. For Meta, the uptick in excitement among employees and users comes well after Wall Street jumped back into the stock. After the company lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2022 and then slashed about a quarter of its workforce, or 21,000 jobs, Meta's stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, reaching a fresh high this month. Meta proved the resilience of its dominant online advertising business, rebuilding the underlying technology after Apple's iOS privacy change made it harder to target users, and adding generative artificial intelligence tools to make it easier for brands to run campaigns. But proving that it can mimic its digital ad success in a totally different market has been a persistent challenge. Facebook's initial foray into VR came in 2014 with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus. Since then, the company has poured more than $63 billion into what's now called Reality Labs, its AR and VR hardware and software division, and it's recording operating losses in the billions of dollars per quarter. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated just $353 million in revenue, accounting for less than 1% of the company's total sales. Industrywide, global shipments of VR and AR headsets in the period sank roughly 28% from a year earlier to 1.1 million units, according to market researcher IDC. \"This is a very long-term bet,\" Zuckerberg said in July 2023. \"At a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because it's just outside of the model of I think even most long-term investors.\" Orion provides a tangible example of the company's strategy and a logical and compelling next step following smart glasses, people familiar with Reality Labs told CNBC. Meta declined to comment.\nA project 10 years in the making\nMeta is planning to start courting developers next year, as it tries to get them excited about building apps for Orion so the company can learn what might resonate with consumers, according to people familiar with the company's road map. The push into the developer community would coincide with Meta's expected debut of the fourth generation of its Llama family of AI models. By releasing a more powerful Llama, Meta is hoping that developers would be able to incorporate the software in their future AR apps to help power tasks like recognizing real-world objects and more accurately reacting to voice commands, the people said. Ultimately, Meta is working toward building a consumer version of Orion, something that could happen within two years, they said. That timeline may be overly ambitious considering how long it took to get Orion this far. Facebook began working on the device as far back as 2016 under the leadership of Oculus' then chief scientist, Michael Abrash, according to people familiar with the matter. Abrash is now chief scientist at Reality Labs.\nMeta employee Sara Nicholson poses with the Ray-Ban sunglasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 24, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo | Reuters\nIn 2018, the project was moved out of research and development and was put on the product path under the guidance of Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, who was Facebook's head of hardware at the time and is now Meta's technology chief. At one point, the company had a version of the device that offered AR visuals but it had to be in extremely controlled settings to work, the people said. For example, visuals didn't work outdoors, they said. Meta has been testing functioning versions of Orion glasses for well over two years, the people said, getting the product to a point where it could finally be unveiled to the broader company and to outsiders. The company finished the prototype in March. Engineers put a lot of work into getting the device to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), about twice the weight of a heavy pair of glasses, and to have a 70-degree field of view, sources said. Zuckerberg, who's been the driving force behind the company's advances in AR and VR, made the ultimate decision to go public with Orion, the people said.\nBuilding on surprise success\nMeta is likely years away from being able to deliver a consumer version of Orion and has numerous challenges to overcome to reach mass production. \"One could criticize Orion as vaporware,\" Joseph Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a report to clients on Oct. 4, referring to \"technology that may not end up in an actual product.\" Bonner, who recommends buying the stock, said the product demonstrates \"Meta's continued commitment to virtual and mixed reality applications.\" Meta will need to develop a global manufacturing supply chain that can account for some of the rare materials used in the device. One particular hurdle will be figuring out how to get mass quantities of silicon carbide, which is used for the displays in the Orion lenses. Meta recently hired someone from semiconductor contract manufacturing company GlobalFoundries to help develop and oversee the supply chain for Orion and related AR and VR devices, people with knowledge of the matter said. In the meantime, Meta is looking to build on the success of its second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Released in partnership with EssilorLuxottica in September of last year, the product featured a number of upgrades, including better camera quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant. The smart glasses went viral on TikTok during the holiday shopping season, and sales exceeded both companies' expectations. More than 730,000 units have been sold in their first three quarters since release, according to IDC. Zuckerberg told investors in July that they were \"a bigger hit sooner than expected.\" Last month, Meta and Luxottica agreed to extend their partnership, with plans to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, people familiar with the matter said. A Luxottica representative didn't respond to a request for comment. Meta is also opening a pop-up shop to showcase the smart glasses and to get them in front of more consumers. The pop-up shop will be at a retail space in Los Angeles.
