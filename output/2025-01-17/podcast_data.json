Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado, the lawmakers said that in the two months since the election, large tech companies have made \"million-dollar gifts to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund in what appears to be an effort to influence and sway the actions and policies of the incoming administration.\"\nAltman personally contributed $1 million to the inauguration fund. Microsoft , Google , Meta and Amazon donated the same amount, but as companies rather than from executives. Apple CEO Tim Cook has reportedly also contributed $1 million.\n\"You have a clear and direct interest in obtaining favors from the incoming administration: your company and many other Big Tech donors are already the subject of ongoing federal investigations and regulatory actions,\" according to the letter posted by Altman on X and later by the senators online.\nIn his post, Altman wrote, \"funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats...\"\nRepresentatives for Warren and Bennet didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nAltman plans to attend Trump's inauguration Monday, a company spokesperson confirmed to CNBC, and will reportedly be joining many of his tech peers in Washington, D.C. Others include Cook, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\nAltman's public moves to support Trump come alongside a thorny legal battle between OpenAI and Musk, who co-founded the startup and has in recent months been a fixture at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.\nMusk is co-leading the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is expected to function as an advisory office. The role could give Musk, who also owns X and runs SpaceX, influence over federal agencies' budgets, staffing and regulations in ways that favor his companies, including his AI startup, xAI.\nTrump has said publicly in the past that he would repeal President Joe Biden's AI executive order, issued in October 2023, which introduced new safety assessments, equity and civil rights guidance and research on AI's impact on the labor market.\nIn the letter, lawmakers say \"the industry's efforts suggest that Big Tech companies are trying to curry favor and skirt the rules\" and that the donations \"raise questions about corruption and the influence of corporate money on the Trump administration.\"\nIt includes a list of questions to be answered by a deadline of Jan. 25, including, \"When and under what circumstances did your company decide to make these contributions to the Trump inaugural fund?\"\nThe letter also asks Altman whether OpenAI officials had any communications about his donation with members of the Trump transition team or the president-elect's other associates, requesting that he list all such communications.\nAltman noted on X that his own donation \"was a personal contribution as you state; i am confused about the questions given that my company did not make a decision.\"\nWATCH: Elon Musk vindicated following Meta lifting restrictions, says Omeed Malik\n\ntitle1:\nSupreme Court upholds TikTok ban, but Trump might offer lifeline\ndescription1:\nThe Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law requiring China-based ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok by Sunday or face an effective ban of the popular social video app in the U.S.\nByteDance has so far refused to sell TikTok, meaning many U.S. users could lose access to the app this weekend. The app may still work for those who already have TikTok on their phones, although ByteDance has also threatened to shut the app down.\nIn a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration, upholding the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which President Joe Biden signed in April.\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the Supreme Court's opinion said. \"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\nSupreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch wrote concurrences.\nTikTok's fate in the U.S. now lies in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who originally favored a TikTok ban during his first administration, but has since flip-flopped on the matter. In December, Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation and allow his administration \"the opportunity to pursue a political resolution of the questions at issue in the case.\"\nIn a post on his social media app Truth Social, Trump wrote that the decision was expected \"and everyone must respect it.\"\n\"My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\" Trump wrote.\nTrump began to speak more favorably of TikTok after he met in February with billionaire Republican megadonor Jeff Yass. Yass is a major ByteDance investor who also owns a stake in the owner of Truth Social.\nTrump will be inaugurated Monday, one day after the TikTok deadline for a sale. TikTok CEO Shou Chew is one of several tech leaders expected to be in attendance, seated on the dais.\nIn a video posted on TikTok, Chew thanked Trump \"for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available\" in the U.S. He said use of TikTok is a First Amendment right, adding that over 7 million American businesses use it to make money and find customers.\n\"Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come,\" he said.\n\ntitle2:\nChatGPT\u2019s head of product will testify in the US government\u2019s case against Google\ndescription2:\nThe U.S. government wants to prove that Google\u2019s competitors face overwhelming barriers to entry as part of its antitrust case against the tech giant. So it\u2019s turning to ChaptGPT\u2019s head of product, Nick Turley, to testify as a witness in hopes he will help fortify its case.\nIn a landmark ruling last August, a court determined that Google holds a monopoly in search. While Google appeals this decision, the Department of Justice is now asking the court to decide what penalties it should face, such as spinning off Chrome or a 10-year ban on releasing any browser product.\nTo bolster its case, the DOJ has pulled in various Google competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Perplexity. It wants specific executives, like Perplexity\u2019s Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko, to testify. (It\u2019s not clear yet whether Shevelenko will do so. Perplexity didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.)\nRecent legal filings confirm that a top executive from OpenAI, Nick Turley, head of product for ChatGPT, will testify as a witness for the U.S. government\u2019s case.\n\u201cMr. Turley is a witness handpicked by Plaintiffs [the DOJ] to testify on OpenAI\u2019s behalf,\u201d Google\u2019s lawyers wrote in a January 16 legal filing.\n\u201cMr. Turley is the OpenAI witness who will testify on behalf of the government at the Evidentiary Hearing,\u201d another filing from January 16 reads.\nNone of the filings specify exactly when Turley will testify. Turley is expected to be asked by the U.S. about \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s relationship with Search Access Points, distribution, barriers to entry and expansion, and data sharing,\u201d per the filing. The DOJ hasn\u2019t provided details about what it wants to ask Turley. (These are the exact same topics it wants to ask Perplexity\u2019s CBO about.)\nThe DOJ uses the term \u201csearch access points\u201d to refer to products like Google Chrome that people use to search the web. Notably, in October 2024, ChatGPT launched its own AI search browser.\nTo prepare itself for Turley\u2019s testimony, Google has subpoenaed OpenAI for documents related to the case. But the two companies are now in a heated dispute over the extent of evidence OpenAI should provide.\nIn a legal filing on January 16, Google criticized OpenAI for producing \u201cstunningly few documents.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s lawyers fired back, noting that Google\u2019s demands for documents from top executives like CEO Sam Altman appear to be a \u201cTrojan horse intended to harass OpenAI executives.\u201d\nOpenAI has agreed to share some documents from Turley\u2019s work files about OpenAI\u2019s strategy on AI products, its integration of AI into search-related products, and its Microsoft partnership, a letter from OpenAI\u2019s lawyers shows.\nGoogle says it needs more documents from more executives, as relying mostly on Turley \u201cwould prejudice Google\u201d since Turley is a witness \u201chandpicked\u201d by the U.S. government, according to the filing.\nGoogle also wants documents from OpenAI that predate the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, claiming these \u201cmay undermine Mr. Turley\u2019s testimony regarding barriers to entry in a way that post-launch documents would not.\u201d But OpenAI says documents that old \u201ccannot meaningfully represent\u201d the current AI landscape.\nBoth sides appear at an impasse and OpenAI has requested the court reject the full scope of Google\u2019s requested evidence.\nOpenAI and Google did not respond to requests for comment. The DOJ declined to comment.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

It\u2019s the latest setback for Amazon\u2019s beleaguered Prime Air program, which aims to deliver around 500 million packages a year to customers by the end of the decade.\nBloomberg reports two Amazon drones crashed in rainy weather at a testing facility in Pendleton, Oregon, in December. In another incident in September, drone operators employed by the company were testing how the drones would perform if one of their propellers failed, according to Bloomberg, and accidentally launched two test flights at once \u2014 causing the drones to collide.\nAmazon said it would suspend drone deliveries in Texas and Arizona, where it has commercial drone operations, pending a software update to its drone fleet, according to Bloomberg.\nAmazon\u2019s drone program has faced numerous setbacks, including the departure of key executives. Last April, Amazon ended Prime Air drone delivery operations in California, although the company plans to expand its drone delivery tests overseas.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft triples down on AI\ndescription4:\nMicrosoft made a trio of announcements this week that are going to be very important for how the company approaches its big AI bet in 2025. It started off by creating a new AI engineering group to focus its developers on building an AI platform and tools for both Microsoft and its customers. Microsoft then announced pay-as-you-go agents for its relaunched Copilot Chat for businesses, and it finished the week by bundling Office AI features into Microsoft 365 for consumers and raising the subscription price.\nAll three of these announcements are linked to Microsoft\u2019s insatiable hunger to win at AI. The company still prioritizes security through employee performance reviews, but it increasingly feels like promoting AI is an equally high priority.\nThe new engineering group is a good example of Microsoft\u2019s priorities. Led by former Meta engineering chief Jay Parikh, the new CoreAI \u2013 Platform and Tools division will combine Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div and AI platform teams together. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the reorganization as \u201centering the next innings of this AI platform shift\u201d and said it will \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d Nadella has regularly said that the pace of AI is changing software development, and now Microsoft is building an AI-first app stack to try and take advantage of this opportunity.\nCombining Microsoft\u2019s AI platform work and its developer division will put AI at the heart of the very tools, platforms, and services that Microsoft builds for customers and its own teams. Nadella even described this platform shift as the ability for Microsoft\u2019s AI agents, which are essentially virtual employees that automate tasks, to eventually be able to build custom applications. It\u2019s a transformation for Microsoft that looks like it will flip the company from software-as-a-service to service-as-software \u2014 where once-manual human tasks are automated by software and AI.\nMicrosoft has spent the past 15 years selling cloud computing to businesses, tempting them to move off traditional software that\u2019s licensed and installed to on-premise servers toward servers hosted by the software giant. Nadella led Microsoft\u2019s transformation to cloud infrastructure and services before becoming CEO, and it\u2019s been hugely successful for the company. Now, Nadella appears to be betting on being able to automate many people-based services and package this up in a software solution Microsoft can sell to businesses.\nI\u2019ve spoken to some employees in Microsoft\u2019s Dev Div organization this week, and it\u2019s clear there is some unease about the company\u2019s commitment to AI at all costs. Microsoft\u2019s new AI engineering group emerged just days after Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg predicted 2025 is going to be a year where \u201cMeta, and the other companies that are working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a mid-level engineer that you have at your company that can write code.\u201d In an interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg said he believes that, over time, a lot of the code in Meta\u2019s apps \u201cwill be built by AI engineers instead of people engineers.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a scary prospect for the thousands of engineers at Meta and Microsoft who have spent their entire careers learning how to build software. One engineer in Microsoft\u2019s new CoreAI team tells me there\u2019s now a feeling that if you\u2019re not all in on AI, there won\u2019t be a place for you in this new team.\nMicrosoft\u2019s transition here will undoubtedly see engineering jobs change, and it\u2019s all part of a revenue opportunity for AI that the company is constantly chasing. Investors are increasingly looking for returns on Microsoft\u2019s big bets on AI, and recent reports have suggested that it\u2019s struggling to sell businesses on the idea of paying extra for AI-powered versions of Office apps. That\u2019s probably why this week we also saw Microsoft relaunch Copilot as Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat, complete with free ChatGPT-like capabilities and pay-as-you-go agents. It\u2019s a rebranding of what was once Bing Enterprise Chat, then Copilot, and now Copilot Chat.\nI spoke to Jared Spataro, Microsoft\u2019s chief marketing officer of AI at work, earlier this week, and he made it clear this relaunch is also Microsoft\u2019s latest attempt to get people hooked on using AI at work. \u201cWhat we find is that when you start to use it, you become accustomed to and appreciative of the value that it can provide at work,\u201d says Spataro.\nThe free chat side of Copilot has already been popular for businesses that rely on Microsoft\u2019s software and services, and by adding in agent capabilities, there\u2019s an upsell opportunity to get businesses to pay extra to automate tasks with AI.\nMicrosoft can also use this Copilot Chat as a way to tempt businesses into upgrading to the full Microsoft 365 Copilot at $30 per user per month. \u201cWhile Copilot Chat is a powerful new on-ramp for everyone in your organization to build the AI habit, Microsoft 365 Copilot remains our best-in-class personal AI assistant for work,\u201d says Spataro.\nThis is where Copilot really transforms from a simple chatbot into a more assistive technology that can analyze Excel data for you, write paragraphs in Word, or generate an entire PowerPoint presentation. A lot of CTOs tell me that businesses have found the most value from Copilot inside Microsoft Teams, where the AI assistant will transcribe meetings and pull out key talking points to make it easy to catch up on calls you might have missed.\nMost businesses aren\u2019t paying the extra for Copilot inside Office apps, though. While adding an AI-powered version of the Python programming language to Excel is powerful and summaries of Outlook emails are super useful, Microsoft needs a lot more compelling Copilot features if it wants businesses to pay that $30 per user per month fee.\nIt\u2019s a similar situation over on the consumer side, which is why Microsoft started bundling its AI-powered Office features into Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions this week. Instead of asking consumers for $20 extra per month for Copilot Pro, Microsoft is raising its subscription prices by $3 per month to bundle Copilot into Office apps.\nAs part of this price bump, Microsoft is providing a set of AI credits that can be used on Copilot in apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. You\u2019ll get a monthly allotment of these credits, which can also be used for things like image generation in the Designer app or in apps on Windows like Paint, Photos, and Notepad. If you want unlimited usage of Copilot in Office apps or all of these AI features, you\u2019ll still need to pay for Copilot Pro.\nMicrosoft had been testing this Microsoft 365 subscription change in Australia, New Zealand, and some markets in Asia, and it feels like the worldwide launch this week is an even bigger test before the company does something similar for its commercial subscriptions.\nGoogle may well force Microsoft\u2019s hand here, after revealing this week that its Gemini Business plan, which you previously had to pay $20 per user per month for, is now free. Google is now bringing all of its AI features to its Workspace app at no extra cost, which piles on the pressure for Microsoft to make some similar moves for commercial customers of Microsoft 365.\nAs the competition heats up in 2025, expect to see Microsoft come up with even more inventive pay-as-you-go agents or AI credit methods to get consumers and businesses addicted to AI.\nThe pad:\nMicrosoft won\u2019t support Office apps on Windows 10 after October 14th. If you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time. Microsoft has started warning that it will no longer support Office apps, known as Microsoft 365 apps, on Windows 10 after October 14th \u2014 the day support ends for the old OS. While the apps will continue to function, there could be issues over time. It\u2019s all part of an effort from Microsoft to get businesses and consumers to upgrade to Windows 11.\nIf you\u2019re still on Windows 10, it\u2019s getting closer to the point of upgrade time.
