The Justice Department argues that it represents a key access point through which many people use Google Search. Chrome controls about 61% of the browser market in the U.S., according to web traffic service StatCounter.\n\ntitle1:\nUS lawyers will reportedly try to force Google to sell Chrome and unbundle Android\ndescription1:\nThe Department of Justice is planning to ask for Google\u2019s antitrust trial judge to force the company to sell off its Chrome browser after the judge ruled the company has maintained an illegal search monopoly, reports Bloomberg.\nChrome is the world\u2019s most widely used browser, and the government\u2019s lawyers have argued that its use in cross-promoting Google\u2019s products is one of the things limiting available channels and incentives for competition to grow.\nRequirements that officials are preparing to propose include that Google separate Android from Search and Google Play, but without trying to force Google to sell off Android. Another requirement would say it has to share more information with advertisers and that it \u201cgive them more control over where their ads appear,\u201d the outlet writes.\nBloomberg also reports that officials will recommend that the company \u201cgive websites more options to prevent their content from being used by Google\u2019s artificial intelligence products.\u201d Finally, they will reportedly push for \u201ca ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case against Google.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nTesla (TSLA) stock up on report Trump wants to ease self-driving rules\ndescription2:\nTesla CEO Elon Musk (R) joins former U.S. President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a campaign rally at the site of his first assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Oct. 5, 2024.\nTesla shares jumped Monday following a report that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is planning to make a federal framework to regulate self-driving vehicles a top priority for the U.S. Transport Department.\nTesla's stock closed up more than 5% Monday after the release of the Bloomberg News report, which cited unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\nCNBC could not independently verify the report and has requested comment from the Trump team and from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a Transportation Department unit tasked to oversee self-driving technologies.\nMusk was a central figure in the business world pushing for Trump's return to the White House in the lead-up to this month's elections. The tech billionaire now stands to benefit from the close relationship he has formed with the Republican politician, who previously served a first presidential term between 2017 and 2021.\nLast week, Trump picked Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the newly minted Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \"DOGE\" for short \u2014 which he said would end government \"bureaucracy,\" relax \"excess\" regulations and cut \"wasteful\" expenditures.\n\ntitle3:\nVenture funding in Europe in 2024 fell to $45 billion, says Atomico\ndescription3:\nFunding for European tech appears to have stabilized in 2024 after dropping precipitously in 2023, but the signs continue to point to more tough times ahead, according to the latest State of European Tech report.\nThe annual survey \u2014 produced by European VC firm Atomico \u2014 notes that startups in the region are on track to raise $45 billion this year. While far from the 50% drop of 2023, the figure is still down by $2 billion compared to a year ago. (Note: Atomico originally projected $45 billion for 2023; it has since revised 2023 up to $47 billion.)\nAtomico has been producing these reports annually for the last decade so this latest edition makes a lot of noise about how much things have grown.\nIt\u2019s undeniable that the tech ecosystem in Europe has blown up: Atomico says that there are now 35,000 tech companies in the region that could be classified as \u201cearly stage,\u201d with 3,400 late-stage companies and 358 valued at over $1 billion. Compare that to 2015, when there were a mere 7,800 early-stage startups, 450 late-stage startups and just 72 tech companies valued at over $1 billion. Yet there is a lot of sobering reading, too, about some of the challenges of the moment and signs of how geopolitical and economic unrest \u2014 despite shiny stories about the boom in AI \u2014 continue to weigh down the market.\nHere are some of the breakout stats:\nExits have fallen off a cliff. This is one of the more stark tables in the report that underscores some of the liquidity pressure that ultimately trickles down to earlier-stage tech companies. Put simply, M&As and IPOs are relatively non-existent right now in European tech. 2024, at the time of the report being published in mid-November, saw just $3 billion in IPO value and $10 billion in M&A, according to S&P Capital figures. Both of these are big drops on the overall trend, which had otherwise seen steady rises in both, \u201cconsistently surpassing $50 billion per year threshold.\u201d (Granted, sometimes all it takes is one big deal to make a year. In 2023, for example, ARM\u2019s $65 billion IPO accounted for a full 92% of total IPO value, and clearly it didn\u2019t have the knock-on effect many had hoped for in kick-starting more activity.) Transaction volumes, Atomico notes, are at their lowest points in a decade.\nImage Credits:Atomico\nDebt on the rise. As you might expect, debt financing is filling in the funding gap especially for startups raising growth rounds. So far this year, debt financing made up a full 14% of all VC investments, totaling some $4.7 billion. That\u2019s a big jump on last year, according to Dealroom\u2019s figures: In 2023, debt made up just $2.6 billion of financing, accounting for 5.5% of all VC investments.\nImage Credits:Atomico\nAverage round sizes bounce back. Last year, the average size of every stage of funding from Series A to D all declined in Europe, with only seed-stage rounds continuing to increase. However, amid an overall decline in number of funding rounds in the region, those startups that are managing to close deals are, on average, raising more. Series A is now $10.6 million (2023: $9.3 million), Series B $25.4 million (2023: $21.3 million), and Series C $55 million (2023: $43 million). The U.S. continues to outpace Europe on round sizes overall.\nBut don\u2019t expect rounds to be raised in quick successions. Atomico noted that the number of startups on average raising within a 24-month time frame declined by 20%, and it has taken longer for a company to convert from A to B on what it calls \u201ccompressed\u201d time frames of 15 months or less, with just 16% raising a Series B in that period in 2024. As you can see in the table below, the number of rounds this year is down on the year before.\nImage Credits:Atomico\nAI continues to lead the pack. As with 2023, artificial intelligence continued to dominate conversations. Atomico spells this out with a graphic showing the burst of AI mentions in earnings calls.\nImage Credits:Atomico\nAnd that has carried through as a strong theme among private companies. Between companies like Wayve, Helsing, Mistral, Poolside, DeepL, and many others, AI startups have led the pack when it comes to the biggest venture deals this year in Europe, raising $11 billion in all. Yet even so, Atomico points out, \u201cEurope has a long way to close the gap with the U.S. in terms of AI funding.\u201d Thanks to outsized rounds for companies like OpenAI, all told the U.S. is shaping up to have invested $47 billion in AI companies this year \u2014 that\u2019s right, $2 billion more than all startup investment in Europe, combined.\nThe U.K. (thanks to Wayve) is currently the biggest market for AI funding in the region, it said.\nValuations improving\u2026 After startup valuations \u201cbottomed out\u201d in 2023, Atomico writes, they are now heading back up, a lagged result of the slow return of activity in the public markets. Some of that is likely also due to the outsized rounds raised by certain companies in certain fields like AI. More generally, the rule appears to be that founders are more open to dilution on larger rounds in earlier stages and that plays out as higher valuations. Then startups raising at later stages are picking up the pieces of that earlier exuberance and are raising down rounds, Atomico said. European startups continue to see valuations on average lower than those of their American counterparts, on average between 29% and 52% lower, Atomico notes.\n(In the graphic below, charting Series C, the average valuation for a U.S. startup is $218 million, compared to $155 million for startup in Europe.)\n\u2026But sentiment is not. If confidence is a strong indicator of the health of a market, there might be some work ahead for the motivators out there. Atomico has been polling founders and investors annually asking how they feel about the state of the market compared to a year ago, and 2024 appears to be a high watermark for low confidence. In a frank assessment of how founders and investors are viewing the market at the moment, a record proportion \u2014 respectively 40% and 26% \u2014 said they felt less confident than 12 months ago.\n\ntitle4:\nCloud software company ServiceTitan files for IPO\ndescription4:\nServiceTitan, a company that sells software to contractors such as plumbers and roofers, on Monday filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \"TTAN.\"\nThe filing suggests that investors could be getting more interested in next-generation software companies. Just a few, including Reddit and Rubrik , debuted on public markets in the U.S. this year, and chipmaker Cerebras filed for an initial public offering. There were basically no tech initial public offerings in 2021 or 2022 as central bankers pushed up interest rates to flight inflation, making investors less willing to bet on money-losing challengers.\nBased in Glendale, California, ServiceTitan offers cloud software for advertising, scheduling jobs, dispatching, producing invoices and taking payments. It had a $35.7 million net loss on $193 million in revenue in the quarter that ended on July 31, according to the filing. Revenue was up about 24% year over year, and the quarterly loss had narrowed from almost $52 million.\nServiceTitan's revenue growth rate will stand out for people investing in cloud stocks, who have seen rates sag with few new public companies in the sector. The average growth rate for Bessemer's Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index, the basis for the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, is 16.6%.\nThe company was originally founded in 2007 by Ara Mahdessian and Vahe Kuzoyan, whose fathers were both residential contractors. While most ServiceTitan customers are small- and medium-sized businesses, it has started focusing more on selling products to big companies and construction customers, according to the filing.\nServiceTitan plans to keep up to 5% of shares in the IPO for eligible clients, the founders' friends and family members, and others through a directed share program.\nInvestors include Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Iconiq and TPG. Iconiq on its own controlled 24% of the company's Class A shares.\nCompetitors include Salesforce and SAP , along with specialty companies such as HouseCall Pro, Jobber and Workwave.\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citigroup are among the company's IPO underwriters.\"\n\nResponse:",
