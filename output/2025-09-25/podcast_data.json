Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Think TikTok or Instagram Reels, but every single video you come across is essentially AI slop.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the rollout of Vibes in a post on Instagram that features a series of AI-generated videos. In one video, a group of fuzzy-looking creatures hops from one fuzzy cube to another. In another, a cat kneads some dough. A third video shows what appears to be an ancient Egyptian woman taking a selfie on a balcony overlooking Ancient Egypt.\nImage Credits:Meta\nAccording to Meta, as you browse the new feed, you\u2019ll see AI-generated videos from both creators and other users. Over time, Meta\u2019s algorithm will begin to show you personalized content.\nYou have the option to generate a video from scratch, or remix a video that you see on your feed. Before publishing, you can add new visuals, layer in music, and adjust styles. You can then post the video directly to the Vibes feed, DM it to others, or cross-post to Instagram and Facebook Stories and Reels.\nMeta\u2019s chief AI officer Alexandr Wang shared in a post that the company has partnered with AI image generators Midjourney and Black Forest Labs for the early version of Vibes, while Meta continues developing its own AI models.\nSince no one really wants an AI-generated version of TikTok, the user comments in response to Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement were about what you\u2019d expect. The top comment on the post reads: \u201cgang nobody wants this,\u201d while another popular comment says: \u201cBro\u2019s posting ai slop on his own app.\u201d Another comment reads: \u201cI think I speak for everyone when I say: What\u2026.?\u201d\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe new feed likely won\u2019t be welcomed by users, especially since the rise of AI technology has caused social media platforms to become flooded with AI slop. The problem has become so widespread that companies like YouTube are now looking to crack down on the issue. This makes Meta\u2019s move particularly puzzling, given that the company said earlier this year that it was tackling \u201cunoriginal\u201d Facebook content and advised creators that they should focus on \u201cauthentic storytelling,\u201d not short videos offering little value.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe launch of the new feed comes as Meta has recently invested heavily in revamping its AI efforts amid concerns that it was falling behind competitors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind.\nIn June, the company restructured its AI efforts to create an AI division called \u201cMeta Superintelligence Labs\u201d following notable staff departures. Meta then reportedly reorganized its AI division into four groups to focus on foundation models, research, product integration, and infrastructure.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft cuts cloud services to Israeli military unit over Palestinian surveillance\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft has cut off the Israel Ministry of Defense\u2019s access to some of its tech and services after an internal investigation found the organization appeared to be using its tech to store surveillance data on phone calls made by Palestinians.\nThe tech giant announced on Thursday that it made the decision to \u201ccease and disable\u201d certain subscriptions from the Israeli military. This affects subscriptions to Azure cloud storage and certain AI services.\n\u201cWe do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,\u201d Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades. This is why we explained publicly on August 15 that Microsoft\u2019s standard terms of service prohibit the use of our technology for mass surveillance of civilians.\u201d\nMicrosoft informed Israel of its decision last week, according to The Guardian.\nThe decision follows Microsoft\u2019s ongoing review of the matter, which started in August. The investigation was sparked by a story in The Guardian that reported that Unit 8200, the elite Israel military intelligence unit, was using Azure cloud storage to house data on phone calls obtained through the surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\nIn his blog post, Smith also said the company appreciated The Guardian\u2019s initial reporting. Smith wrote that without it, they wouldn\u2019t have known to look into the matter, as due to customer privacy rights, they can\u2019t access a customer\u2019s content.\n\u201cAs employees, we all have a shared interest in privacy protection, given the business value it creates by ensuring our customers can rely on our services with rock solid trust,\u201d Smith wrote.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe company said the review is ongoing but declined to comment to TechCrunch regarding what was still under review.\nMicrosoft has been under fire from both employees and outsiders for its involvement with Israel over the past year. Protests regarding Microsoft\u2019s relationship with Israel broke out at the company\u2019s 50th anniversary celebration in April. In August, several employees staged a sit-in at Smith\u2019s office, forcing a lockdown.\nThe company has fired multiple employees in recent months for their activism related to Microsoft\u2019s contracts with Israel.\n\ntitle2:\nTrump signs executive order to facilitate TikTok deal\ndescription2:\nPresident Donald Trump has signed an executive order that essentially approves the sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to an American investor group in order to keep the social media app operational in the country. Vice President JD Vance said that the deal would value TikTok US at \u201caround $14 billion.\u201d\nTikTok was required to divest its American business or be banned in the U.S. via a national security law originally signed by former president Joe Biden. Trump\u2019s executive order essentially bars the attorney general or Department of Justice from enforcing that law for 120 days while the divestiture plan presented to the president is executed.\nTikTok\u2019s owner ByteDance has not yet publicly acknowledged the deal or executive order, but did, on September 19, issue a statement that \u201cit will work in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\u201d\nTrump said China\u2019s president Xi Jinping spoke to him and gave him approval.\n\u201cI spoke with President Xi; we had a good talk,\u201d Trump said during a briefing with reporters. \u201cI told him what we were doing, and he said, \u2018Go ahead with it.\u201d\nThe order states that TikTok\u2019 U.S. operations will establish a new board of directors, and that the app\u2019s recommendation algorithm, source code, and content moderation system in the US will be transferred to the control of its new owners. Under the deal\u2019s terms, Oracle will oversee the app\u2019s security operations and provide computing services for TikTok US.\n\u201cIt\u2019s owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,\u201d Trump said during the briefing. \u201cThis is going to be American operated all the way.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nTrump said that Oracle would be among the U.S. investors in TikTok US but did not disclose the full list of new owners. CNBC reports that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will get a 45% stake in TikTok\u2019s US company.\n\u201cThis deal really does mean Americans can use TikTok but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past because their data is secure and it won\u2019t be used as a propaganda weapon like it has in the past,\u201d Vance said.\nDuring the briefing, Trump stated that \u201cevery group, every philosophy, every policy will be treated fairly\u201d after being asked if the algorithm would show MAGA-related content following the deal.\nTrump last week signed an executive order that extended ByteDance\u2019s deadline to divest TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations or be banned. This marked the fourth time that Trump extended the deadline.\nTrump initiated the push to ban TikTok in 2020, and the idea later received bipartisan backing during Biden\u2019s administration.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Pulse to proactively write you morning briefs\ndescription3:\nOpenAI is launching a new feature inside of ChatGPT called Pulse, which generates personalized reports for users while they sleep. Pulse offers users five to 10 briefs that can get them up to speed on their day and is aimed at encouraging users to check ChatGPT first thing in the morning \u2014 much like they would check social media or a news app.\nPulse is part of a broader shift in OpenAI\u2019s consumer products, which are lately being designed to work for users asynchronously instead of responding to questions. Features like ChatGPT Agent or Codex aim to make ChatGPT feel more like an assistant rather than a chatbot. With Pulse, OpenAI seemingly wants ChatGPT to be more proactive.\n\u201cWe\u2019re building AI that lets us take the level of support that only the wealthiest have been able to afford and make it available to everyone over time,\u201d said OpenAI\u2019s new CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, in a blog post. \u201cAnd ChatGPT Pulse is the first step in that direction \u2014 starting with Pro users today, but with the goal of rolling out this intelligence to all.\u201d\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this week that some of ChatGPT\u2019s new \u201ccompute-intensive\u201d products would be limited to the company\u2019s most expensive subscription plan \u2014 which is the case for Pulse. OpenAI has previously said it\u2019s severely limited in the number of servers it has to power ChatGPT, and it\u2019s rapidly building out AI data centers with partners like Oracle and SoftBank to increase its capacity.\nStarting Thursday, OpenAI will roll out Pulse for subscribers to its $200-a-month Pro plan, for whom it will appear as a new tab in the ChatGPT app. The company says it would like to launch Pulse to all ChatGPT users in the future, with Plus subscribers to get access soon, but it first needs to make the product more efficient.\nPulse\u2019s reports can be roundups of news articles on a specific topic \u2014 like updates on a specific sports team \u2014 as well as more personalized briefs based on a user\u2019s context.\nIn a demo for TechCrunch, OpenAI product lead Adam Fry showed several reports Pulse had made for him: a roundup of news about British soccer team Arsenal; group Halloween costume suggestions for his wife and kids; and a toddler-friendly travel itinerary for his family\u2019s upcoming trip to Sedona, Arizona.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAn example of Pulse\u2019s cards and reports. Image Credits:OpenAI\nEach report is displayed as a \u201ccard\u201d featuring AI-generated images and text. Users can click on each one to get the full report and can then query ChatGPT about the contents. Pulse will proactively generate some reports, but users can also ask Pulse for new automated reports or offer feedback on existing ones.\nA core part of Pulse is that it stops after generating a few reports and shows a message: \u201cGreat, that\u2019s it for today.\u201d According to Fry, that\u2019s an intentional design choice to make the service different from engagement-optimized social media apps.\nPulse is compatible with ChatGPT\u2019s Connectors, so users can connect apps like Google Calendar and Gmail. Once that\u2019s set up, Pulse will parse through your email overnight to surface the most important messages in the morning, or access your calendar to generate an agenda for upcoming events.\nIf users have ChatGPT\u2019s memory features turned on, Pulse will also pull in context from previous chats to improve your reports. OpenAI\u2019s personalization lead, Christina Wadsworth Kaplan, gave an example of how Pulse automatically picked up on her love of running to create an itinerary for her upcoming trip to London that included running routes.\nWadsworth Kaplan described Pulse as a \u201cnet-new functionality\u201d for a consumer product. As a pescatarian, she says Pulse takes dinner reservations on her calendar and finds menu items that work with her diet.\nBut it\u2019s hard to overlook how Pulse could compete with existing news products, such as Apple News, paid newsletters, or traditional journalism outlets. Fry doesn\u2019t expect Pulse to replace the various news apps people use, and the feature cites its sources with links in the same way ChatGPT Search does.\nIt remains to be seen if Pulse is worth the computational power it requires to work. Fry says the service can \u201cvary tremendously\u201d in how much computing power it spends on a given task \u2014 for some projects, it\u2019s fairly efficient, but others may require searching the web and synthesizing lots of documents.\nEventually, OpenAI would like to make Pulse more agentic, to the point where it could make restaurant reservations on a user\u2019s behalf, or draft emails that users could approve to be sent. But such features may be a long way out and would likely require OpenAI\u2019s agentic models to improve a great deal before users would trust it with such decisions.\n\ntitle4:\nTesla asks EPA not to roll back emissions rules as Trump calls climate change a 'con job'\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nTesla has asked the Environmental Protection Agency not to roll back current vehicle emissions standards, breaking from other major automakers who want to see the rules eased. The company\u2019s request comes the same week that President Donald Trump \u2014 who Tesla CEO Elon Musk spent $300 million to help elect \u2014 told the United Nations General Assembly that he thinks climate change is a \u201ccon job\u201d and a \u201cscam.\u201d\nTesla also asked the EPA not to scuttle a 2009 legal standard known as the Endangerment Finding, which many modern environmental regulations (like the vehicle emissions standards) are based on. Tesla said that finding is \u201cbased on a robust factual and scientific record,\u201d according to the company\u2019s letter to the agency.\nThe EPA has been seeking comment since August for these proposed attacks on environmental rules. The agency\u2019s administrator, Lee Zeldin, said at the time that, if passed, the rollbacks would drive \u201ca dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s nominal mission is to \u201caccelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy.\u201d But the company financially benefits from stricter environmental regulations. When other automakers fall short of fleet emissions goals, they pay companies like Tesla hundreds of millions of dollars to buy \u201ccredits\u201d to make up the difference. (Those credits technically come from a California program that has also been a Republican target.) While Tesla is asking for the standards to be maintained, the company told the EPA it is \u201copen to discussing mechanisms to streamline\u201d them in order to keep them around.\"\n\nResponse:",
