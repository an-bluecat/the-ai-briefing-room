Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday April 2), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nResearchers suggest OpenAI trained AI models on paywalled O'Reilly books\ndescription0:\nOpenAI has been accused by many parties of training its AI on copyrighted content sans permission. Now a new paper by an AI watchdog organization makes the serious accusation that the company increasingly relied on nonpublic books it didn\u2019t license to train more sophisticated AI models.\nAI models are essentially complex prediction engines. Trained on a lot of data \u2014 books, movies, TV shows, and so on \u2014 they learn patterns and novel ways to extrapolate from a simple prompt. When a model \u201cwrites\u201d an essay on a Greek tragedy or \u201cdraws\u201d Ghibli-style images, it\u2019s simply pulling from its vast knowledge to approximate. It isn\u2019t arriving at anything new.\nWhile a number of AI labs, including OpenAI, have begun embracing AI-generated data to train AI as they exhaust real-world sources (mainly the public web), few have eschewed real-world data entirely. That\u2019s likely because training on purely synthetic data comes with risks, like worsening a model\u2019s performance.\nThe new paper, out of the AI Disclosures Project, a nonprofit co-founded in 2024 by media mogul Tim O\u2019Reilly and economist Ilan Strauss, draws the conclusion that OpenAI likely trained its GPT-4o model on paywalled books from O\u2019Reilly Media. (O\u2019Reilly is the CEO of O\u2019Reilly Media.)\nIn ChatGPT, GPT-4o is the default model. O\u2019Reilly doesn\u2019t have a licensing agreement with OpenAI, the paper says.\n\u201cGPT-4o, OpenAI\u2019s more recent and capable model, demonstrates strong recognition of paywalled O\u2019Reilly book content \u2026 compared to OpenAI\u2019s earlier model GPT-3.5 Turbo,\u201d wrote the co-authors of the paper. \u201cIn contrast, GPT-3.5 Turbo shows greater relative recognition of publicly accessible O\u2019Reilly book samples.\u201d\nThe paper used a method called DE-COP, first introduced in an academic paper in 2024, designed to detect copyrighted content in language models\u2019 training data. Also known as a \u201cmembership inference attack,\u201d the method tests whether a model can reliably distinguish human-authored texts from paraphrased, AI-generated versions of the same text. If it can, it suggests that the model might have prior knowledge of the text from its training data.\nThe co-authors of the paper \u2014 O\u2019Reilly, Strauss, and AI researcher Sruly Rosenblat \u2014 say that they probed GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and other OpenAI models\u2019 knowledge of O\u2019Reilly Media books published before and after their training cutoff dates. They used 13,962 paragraph excerpts from 34 O\u2019Reilly books to estimate the probability that a particular excerpt had been included in a model\u2019s training dataset.\nAccording to the results of the paper, GPT-4o \u201crecognized\u201d far more paywalled O\u2019Reilly book content than OpenAI\u2019s older models, including GPT-3.5 Turbo. That\u2019s even after accounting for potential confounding factors, the authors said, like improvements in newer models\u2019 ability to figure out whether text was human-authored.\n\u201cGPT-4o [likely] recognizes, and so has prior knowledge of, many non-public O\u2019Reilly books published prior to its training cutoff date,\u201d wrote the co-authors.\nIt isn\u2019t a smoking gun, the co-authors are careful to note. They acknowledge that their experimental method isn\u2019t foolproof and that OpenAI might\u2019ve collected the paywalled book excerpts from users copying and pasting it into ChatGPT.\nMuddying the waters further, the co-authors didn\u2019t evaluate OpenAI\u2019s most recent collection of models, which includes GPT-4.5 and \u201creasoning\u201d models such as o3-mini and o1. It\u2019s possible that these models weren\u2019t trained on paywalled O\u2019Reilly book data or were trained on a lesser amount than GPT-4o.\nThat being said, it\u2019s no secret that OpenAI, which has advocated for looser restrictions around developing models using copyrighted data, has been seeking higher-quality training data for some time. The company has gone so far as to hire journalists to help fine-tune its models\u2019 outputs. That\u2019s a trend across the broader industry: AI companies recruiting experts in domains like science and physics to effectively have these experts feed their knowledge into AI systems.\nIt should be noted that OpenAI pays for at least some of its training data. The company has licensing deals in place with news publishers, social networks, stock media libraries, and others. OpenAI also offers opt-out mechanisms \u2014 albeit imperfect ones \u2014 that allow copyright owners to flag content they\u2019d prefer the company not use for training purposes.\nStill, as OpenAI battles several suits over its training data practices and treatment of copyright law in U.S. courts, the O\u2019Reilly paper isn\u2019t the most flattering look.\nOpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta's head of AI research plans to leave the company\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMeta\u2019s VP of AI research, Joelle Pineau, is planning to leave the company, she announced in a post on Facebook Tuesday. Pineau said she\u2019s leaving in May after more than two years overseeing FAIR, Meta\u2019s internal AI research lab led by Yann LeCun.\nPineau\u2019s exit comes as Meta ramps up its AI efforts, with the company planning to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025.\nIn a statement to Bloomberg News, a Meta spokesperson said the company does not have an immediate replacement for Pineau but is conducting a search for her successor. Last year, Meta reportedly reorganized the company to have its AI research unit report to the company\u2019s chief product officer, Chris Cox.\nAs for Pineau, the executive said she\u2019ll take some time off before jumping into an unnamed \u201cnew adventure.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nAndreessen Horowitz is trying to nab a piece of TikTok with Oracle, report says\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nThe venture capital firm is reportedly in talks to invest in TikTok as part of a bid led by Oracle and other American investors looking to buy out TikTok from ByteDance, according to the Financial Times.\nTikTok is once again slated to be banned in the U.S. on April 5 unless its Chinese-based owner sells its U.S. branch to a non-Chinese owner. The Oracle deal is said to be one of the frontrunners, according to the FT.\nAndreessen Horowitz has a long history of investing in social media: It was an early investor in Facebook and Instagram and invested $400 million to help Elon Musk acquire Twitter. The firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle3:\nMark Cuban backs Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on Bluesky's underlying technology\ndescription3:\nSkylight, a startup taking on TikTok with a more open alternative, is launching its mobile app to the public on Tuesday after just 10 weeks of active development. The app, which is backed by Mark Cuban and others, is now one of many to build on top of the AT Protocol \u2014 the same technology that underpins the social network Bluesky and a growing number of other apps.\nDeveloped by co-founders Tori White (CEO) and Reed Harmeyer (CTO), Skylight offers a short-form video app experience with many familiar features, including an in-app video editor; the ability to comment, like, and share videos; set up your own user profile; and follow others.\nBecause it\u2019s also built on the AT Protocol (or \u201cATProto\u201d for short), users will immediately be tapped into Bluesky\u2019s network of over 33.8 million users. That means videos posted on Skylight can be seen and engaged with by users on Bluesky and other ATProto-based apps, like the more photo-centric app Flashes, for example.\nImage Credits:Skylight Social\nThe company is funded by a pre-seed round from Cuban, who said earlier this year that he wanted to fund a TikTok alternative built on the AT Protocol. Leslie Feinzaig\u2019s Graham & Walker Venture Fund also invested.\nWhite, who used to be a travel influencer and is now a self-taught software developer living in Seattle, says she and co-founder Hermeyer were inspired to create Skylight when they first heard that TikTok was getting banned in the U.S.\nIn preparation for the ban, which is currently on pause, White had backed up her TikTok videos. But she still worried about losing access to her community and comments. She and Hermeyer had already been playing around with ATProto and saw the potential.\nImage Credits:Skylight Social\n\u201cThe first thing that interested us about ATProto was that Bluesky was not failing,\u201d Harmeyer told TechCrunch at the ATmosphere Conference in Seattle in March. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see the \u2018fail whale,\u2019\u201d he said, a reference to the graphic that appeared in Twitter\u2019s early days when the app was constantly crashing. \u201cThat made us feel comfortable about the underlying technology.\u201d\nHarmeyer and White soon realized this was an ideal time to build a new social app on the protocol that could be \u201cban-proof.\u201d\nTapping into her influencer background, White began documenting Skylight\u2019s development on TikTok, which helped bring exposure to the product and build a following of potentially interested users.\nImage Credits:Skylight Social\n\u201cWe started with distribution,\u201d White explained. \u201cI actually made a video before we ever wrote a line of code for this \u2026 [so] everyone can follow our journey as we build,\u201d she told TechCrunch at the conference. \u201cWe were like, oh my gosh, we are building this thing that we think is so cool, but no one cares yet. So we have to build a way to tell people about it so that they would care, because we know people need it,\u201d she said.\nToday, White\u2019s @buildwithtori TikTok profile has nearly 50,000 followers, many of which turned into early testers.\nLike Bluesky, Skylight supports video uploads of up to three minutes in length, a recent increase from the one-minute-long videos supported previously. But White sees Skylight becoming more than just a decentralized TikTok clone.\nImage Credits:Skylight Social\nShe hints that Skylight in the future will allow users to customize their feed, including by utilizing new gestures beyond swiping and scrolling.\nOther features in the works include support for sounds, duets, stitching, bookmarks, and playlists.\nThe app is in beta on the Google Play Store and is now available publicly on Apple\u2019s App Store after initial testing.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta's head of AI research plans to leave the company\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nMeta\u2019s VP of AI research, Joelle Pineau, is planning to leave the company, she announced in a post on Facebook Tuesday. Pineau said she\u2019s leaving in May after more than two years overseeing FAIR, Meta\u2019s internal AI research lab led by Yann LeCun.\nPineau\u2019s exit comes as Meta ramps up its AI efforts, with the company planning to spend $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025.\nIn a statement to Bloomberg News, a Meta spokesperson said the company does not have an immediate replacement for Pineau but is conducting a search for her successor.
