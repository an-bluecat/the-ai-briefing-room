Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday January 30), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon is reportedly in talks to invest $50B in OpenAI\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI, a company already valued at $500 billion, has made it known that it\u2019s on the hunt for another $100 billion in investment. Such a funding round could lead the company\u2019s valuation to shoot up to a titanic $830 billion. The Wall Street Journal is now reporting that Amazon may contribute at least $50 billion of that record-breaking investment.\nNot much is known about the potential deal, although the Journal notes that Amazon\u2019s CEO, Andy Jassy, is currently leading the negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. TechCrunch reached out to Amazon and OpenAI for comment.\nIn its pursuit of additional funding, OpenAI has also reportedly been having discussions with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East, and The New York Times has written that the startup has held additional talks with Nvidia, Microsoft, and SoftBank. The funding deal is expected to close by the end of Q1.\nSuch a partnership between Amazon and OpenAI would be particularly interesting because of Amazon\u2019s close ties to the OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Amazon\u2019s AWS is the primary cloud and training provider for Anthropic, and the company has invested at least $8 billion into Anthropic. Amazon also recently opened an $11 billion data center campus in Indiana, designed to exclusively run Anthropic models.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk's SpaceX, Tesla, and xAI in talks to merge, according to reports\ndescription1:\nThree of Elon Musk\u2019s companies \u2014 SpaceX, xAI, and Tesla \u2014 are in play for a potential merger. While the talks appear to be in the early stage, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, it could eventually lead to at least one company folding into SpaceX.\nTwo scenarios are being hashed out. In one, SpaceX and Tesla would merge, per Bloomberg, citing unnamed insiders. In another, SpaceX and aXI (which already owns Musk\u2019s social media platform X) would combine.\nAccording to reporting by Reuters, a merger between SpaceX and xAI could take place ahead of a planned SpaceX IPO this year. This would bring products like the Grok chatbot, X platform, Starlink satellites, and SpaceX rockets together under one corporation.\nCompany representatives from SpaceX and xAI have not discussed this possibility in public. However, recent filings show that two new corporate entities were established in Nevada on January 21, which are called K2 Merger Sub Inc. and K2 Merger Sub 2 LLC. This suggests that Musk is keeping all options open.\nThere are upsides to either scenario. Combining the SpaceX and xAI companies could allow xAI to put its data centers in space, something Musk has said he wants. A SpaceX-Tesla tie-up could align the EV maker\u2019s energy storage business with the data center in space idea as well.\nAnd both options \u2014 as well as a combination of all three companies \u2014 fall in line with Musk\u2019s comments and recent actions to consolidate, or at the very least share resources between them. Last year, SpaceX agreed to invest $2 billion in xAI, according to The Wall Street Journal, and earlier this week, Tesla (also led by Musk) revealed it, too, invested $2 billion in the AI startup.\nLast year, xAI bought X in a deal that Musk said valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. SpaceX, which has been around since 2002, reportedly launched a secondary sale that valued it at $800 billion, making it the most valuable private company in the U.S.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nA recent Financial Times report indicated that Musk wants to take SpaceX public in June. Then again, Musk\u2019s grand plans rarely happen on time.\nThis article was originally published at 10:30 a.m. PT. It has since been updated with new information about Tesla.\n\ntitle2:\nThe iPhone just had its best quarter ever\ndescription2:\nApple had a great Q1, though iPhone sales were the real standout. The company reports that its signature device had its best quarter ever, thanks partially to a surge of sales in regions like China and India.\n\u201ciPhone had its best-ever quarter driven by unprecedented demand, with all-time records across every geographic segment,\u201d said CEO Tim Cook during the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday. Apple\u2019s earnings report shows the company sold $85 billion worth of iPhones during its first quarter, up from $69 billion in the same period last year.\nDuring the call\u2019s Q&A portion, Cook revealed that China had seen a huge surge in sales. \u201cIt was driven by iPhone, where we set an all-time revenue record,\u201d Cook said, noting that it was the \u201cbest iPhone quarter in history in Greater China.\u201d Cook said the sales bump had been driven by enthusiasm for the iPhone 17, which was announced in September. The new model has proven to be significantly more popular than the company\u2019s previous iPhone.\nApple\u2019s earnings report shows that its overall sales in the Greater China region jumped from $18.5 billion in the year-ago quarter to $25.5 billion. Cook noted that, overall, the company had fared quite well in the region. \u201cI would tell you that during the quarter, traffic in our stores in China grew by strong double digits year over year,\u201d he said.\nCook also highlighted India as another region where iPhones \u2014 as well as other products \u2014 seemed to be flying off the shelves. \u201cWe did set a quarterly revenue record during the December quarter,\u201d Cook said, noting that records had been set for \u201ciPhone and Mac and iPad [sales] and an all-time revenue record on services.\u201d Cook called it \u201ca terrific quarter\u201d in a country that he noted is \u201cthe second largest smartphone market in the world and the fourth largest PC market.\u201d\nThe iPhone aside, Apple\u2019s overall sales jumped across every geographical region, its earnings report shows. In the Americas, for instance, sales went from $52.6 billion a year ago to $58.5 billion, while in Europe, they increased from $33.8 billion to $38.1 billion.\n\ntitle3:\nMicrosoft won\u2019t stop buying AI chips from Nvidia, AMD, even after launching its own, Nadella says\ndescription3:\nMicrosoft this week deployed its first crop of its homegrown AI chips in one of its data centers, with plans to roll out more in the coming months, it says.\nThe chip, named the Maia 200, is designed to be what Microsoft calls an \u201cAI inference powerhouse,\u201d meaning it\u2019s optimized for the compute-intensive work of running AI models in production. The company released some impressive processing-speed specs for Maia, saying it outperforms Amazon\u2019s latest Trainium chips and Google\u2019s latest Tensor Processing Units (TPU).\nAll of the cloud giants are turning to their own AI chip designs in part because of the difficulty, and expense, of obtaining the latest and greatest from Nvidia \u2014 a supply crunch that shows no signs of abating.\nBut even with its own state-of-the-art, high-performance chip in hand, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company will still be buying chips made by others.\n\u201cWe have a great partnership with Nvidia, with AMD. They are innovating. We are innovating,\u201d he explained. \u201cI think a lot of folks just talk about who\u2019s ahead. Just remember, you have to be ahead for all time to come.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBecause we can vertically integrate doesn\u2019t mean we just only vertically integrate,\u201d meaning building its own systems from top to bottom, without using wares from other vendors.\nThat said, Maia 200 will be used by Microsoft\u2019s own so-called Superintelligence team, the AI specialists building the software giant\u2019s own frontier models. That\u2019s according to Mustafa Suleyman, the former Google DeepMind co-founder who now leads the team. Microsoft is working on its own models to perhaps one day lessen its reliance on OpenAI, Anthropic, and other model makers.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

But, by all accounts, securing access to the most advanced AI hardware is still a challenge for everyone, paying customers and internal teams alike.\nSo in a post on X, Suleyman clearly relished sharing the news that his team gets first dibs. \u201cIt\u2019s a big day,\u201d he wrote when the chip launched. \u201cOur Superintelligence team will be the first to use Maia 200 as we develop our frontier AI models.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nApple buys Israeli startup Q.ai as the AI race heats up\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nApple, Meta, and Google are locked in a fierce battle to lead the next wave of AI, and they\u2019ve recently increased their focus on hardware. With its latest acquisition of the AI startup Q.ai, Apple aims to gain an edge, particularly in the audio sector.\n\u200bAs first reported by Reuters, Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli startup specializing in imaging and machine learning, particularly technologies that enable devices to interpret whispered speech and enhance audio in noisy environments. Apple has been adding new AI features to its AirPods, including the live translation capability introduced last year.\nThe company has also developed technology that detects subtle facial muscle activity, which could help the tech giant enhance the Vision Pro headset.\nThe Financial Times reported that the deal is valued at nearly $2 billion, making it Apple\u2019s second-largest acquisition to date, after buying Beats Electronics for $3 billion in 2014.\n\u200bNotably, this is the second time CEO Aviad Maizels has sold a company to Apple. In 2013, he sold PrimeSense, a 3D-sensing company that played a key role in Apple\u2019s transition from fingerprint sensors to facial recognition on iPhones.\nQ.ai launched in 2022 and is backed by Kleiner Perkins, Gradient Ventures, and others. \u200bIts founding team, including Maizels and co-founders Yonatan Wexler and Avi Barliya, will join Apple as part of the acquisition.\nThe news comes a few hours ahead of Apple\u2019s first quarterly earnings, in which analysts are estimating revenue at around $138 billion. It\u2019s also expected to be the company\u2019s strongest iPhone sales growth in four years.\"\n\nResponse:",
