Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The two previously launched Qordoba together, which helped companies localize products to new markets.\nWriter has grown over the years into a full-stack generative AI platform, with products that can be customized for various enterprise use cases.\nImage Credits:Writer\nIn 2023, Writer launched its own family of models, Palmyra, for text generation. Later that year, the firm debuted features that connect business data sources to its models, along with the ability for customers to self-host Writer-created models.\nJust in October, Writer released a model, Palmyra X 004, trained almost entirely on synthetic data. Developing it cost just $700,000, Writer claims \u2014 compared to estimates of $4.6 million for a comparably-sized OpenAI model.\nWriter\u2019s current focus is on \u201cAI agents\u201d that can plan and execute workflows across systems and teams, as well as customizable AI guardrails and a suite of no-code development tools.\nDespite the intense competition in the generative AI space, Writer has done quite well for itself. The company has hundreds of clients, including Mars, Ally Bank, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Uber, Accenture, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, and Intuit.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of engineering required to transform models into reliable business tools,\u201d Patrick Stokes, EVP of product and industries marketing at Salesforce, said in a press release. \u201cWriter provides a refined, AI-powered solution that\u2019s effective, easy to deploy, and has rapidly accelerated our workflows here at Salesforce. We\u2019re excited to join them on this journey not only as an investor, but also as a customer.\u201d\nAccenture, Balderton, Insight Partners, and Vanguard also participated in Writer\u2019s Series C.\nWriter\u2019s latest funding is another sign venture capital\u2019s enthusiasm for generative AI isn\u2019t waning. According to a report from Accel, generative AI startups will get 40% of all VC cash poured into cloud technologies this year. And in the first half of 2024, investments in generative AI startups topped $3.9 billion, per PitchBook \u2014 not counting OpenAI\u2019s $6.6 billion round.\nThe generative AI market is projected to surpass $1 trillion in revenue within the next decade. It faces headwinds, however, like privacy and copyright challenges, and architectural issues that cause phenomena like hallucinations.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

The software giant has been moving existing users of these apps over to the new Outlook for Windows app in recent months, and now it has set an end of support date for the Mail, Calendar, and People apps of December 31st.\nOnce the apps reach end of support later this year, Microsoft warns that users who haven\u2019t moved to the new Outlook app \u201cwill no longer be able to send and receive email using Windows Mail and Calendar.\u201d\nMicrosoft has been rolling out the new Outlook for Windows app for years, with it officially reaching the general availability stage in August.

That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo's waitlist.\nWith more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company's robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.\n\"Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,\" Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. \"Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We're so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can't wait to serve more riders soon.\"\nThe company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.\nWaymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.\nThe robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday.
