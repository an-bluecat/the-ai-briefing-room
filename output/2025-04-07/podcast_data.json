Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

This fully encrypted mainframe is powered by an IBM Telum II processor and is designed for more than 250 AI use cases, the company says, including AI agents and generative AI.\nMainframes might seem like old hat, but they\u2019re used by 71% of Fortune 500 companies today, according to one source. In 2024, the mainframe market was worth an estimated $5.3 billion, per consulting firm Market Research Future.\nThe z17 can process 450 billion inference operations in a day, a 50% increase over its predecessor, the IBM z16, which was released in 2022 and ran on the company\u2019s original Tellum processor. The system is designed to be able to fully integrate with other hardware, software, and open-source tools.\nTina Tarquinio, VP of product management and design for IBM Z, told TechCrunch that this mainframe upgrade has been in the works for five years \u2014 well before the current AI frenzy that started with the release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022.\nIBM spent more than 2,000 research hours getting feedback from over 100 customers as it built the z17, Tarquinio said. She thinks it\u2019s interesting to see that, now, five years later, the feedback they got aligned with where the market ended up heading.\n\u201cIt has been wild knowing that we\u2019re introducing an AI accelerator, and then seeing, especially in the later half of 2022, all of the changes in the industry regarding AI,\u201d Tarquinio told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s been really exciting. I think the biggest point has been [that] we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know about what\u2019s coming, right? So the possibilities are really unlimited in terms of what AI can help us do.\u201d\nThe z17 is set up to adapt and accommodate where the AI market heads, Tarquinio said. The mainframe will support 48 IBM Spyre AI accelerator chips upon release, with the plan to bring that number up to 96 within 12 months.\n\u201cWe are purposely building in headroom,\u201d Tarquinio said. \u201cWe\u2019re purposely building in AI agility. So as new models are introduced, [we\u2019re] making sure that we\u2019ve built in the headroom for bigger, larger models \u2014 models that maybe need more local memory to talk to each other. We\u2019ve built in that because we know it\u2019s really the approach that will change, right? The new models will come and go.\u201d\nTarquinio said that one of the highlights of this latest hardware \u2014 although she joked it was like being asked to pick her favorite child \u2014 is that the z17 is more energy-efficient than its predecessor and supposedly competitors, too.\n\u201cOn-chip, we\u2019re increasing the AI acceleration by seven and a half times, but that\u2019s five and a half times less energy than you would need to do, like, multi-model on another type of accelerator or platform in the industry,\u201d Tarquinio said.\nThe z17 mainframes will become generally available on June 8.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle is allegedly paying some AI staff to do nothing for a year rather than join rivals\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nRetaining top AI talent is tough amid cutthroat competition between Google, OpenAI, and other heavyweights.\nGoogle\u2019s AI division, DeepMind, has resorted to using \u201caggressive\u201d noncompete agreements for some AI staff in the U.K. that bar them from working for competitors for up to a year, Business Insider reports.\nSome are paid during this time, in what amounts to a lengthy stretch of PTO. But the practice can make researchers feel left out of the quick pace of AI progress, reported BI.\nIn the U.S., the FTC banned most noncompetes last year, but that doesn\u2019t apply to DeepMind\u2019s London headquarters.\nLast month, the VP of AI at Microsoft posted on X about how DeepMind staff are reaching out to him \u201cin despair\u201d over the challenge of escaping their noncompete clauses:\nDear @GoogDeepMind ers, First, congrats on the new impressive models.\nEvery week one of you reaches out to me in despair to ask me how to escape your notice periods and noncompetes. Also asking me for a job because your manager has explained this is the way to get promoted, but\u2026 \u2014 Nando de Freitas (@NandoDF) March 26, 2025\nGoogle didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from TechCrunch but told BI it uses noncompetes \u201cselectively.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft reportedly fires staff whose protest interrupted its Copilot event\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nOn Monday, Microsoft reportedly terminated the roles of two software engineers, Ibtihal Aboussad and Vaniya Agrawal, who protested the company\u2019s reported dealings with the Israeli military during Microsoft\u2019s Copilot and 50th anniversary event last week.\nAccording to an internal message viewed by CNBC, Microsoft wrote that Aboussad could have raised concerns \u201cconfidentially with your manager, or with Global Employee Relations. Instead, you chose to intentionally disrupt the speech of Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman.\u201d\nLast Friday, during the event, Aboussad shouted that Suleyman had \u201cblood on his hands,\u201d interrupting him while he delivered a keynote about new AI products. Later that day, Agrawal interjected during a panel featuring Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, former CEO Steve Ballmer, and founder Bill Gates, shouting \u201cshame on all of you \u2026 Cut ties with Israel.\u201d\nShortly after the incidents, Aboussad sent an email to Microsoft staff and executives claiming the company had silenced certain dissenting employees, according to CNBC. The email reportedly contained a link to a petition from \u201cNo Azure for Apartheid,\u201d a group of Microsoft staffers who have made headlines for their protests against the company\u2019s work with Israel in the past.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon says its AI video model can now generate minutes-long clips\ndescription3:\nAmazon has upgraded its AI video model, Nova Reel, with the ability to generate videos up to two minutes in length.\nNova Reel, announced in December 2024, was Amazon\u2019s first foray into the generative video space. It competes with models from OpenAI, Google, and others in what\u2019s fast becoming a crowded market.\nThe latest Nova Reel, Nova Reel 1.1, can generate \u201cmulti-shot\u201d videos with \u201cconsistent style\u201d across shots, explained AWS developer advocate Elizabeth Fuentes in a blog post. Users can provide a prompt up to 4,000 characters long to generate up to a two-minute video composed of six-second shots.\nNova Reel 1.1 also introduces a new mode called \u201cMultishot Manual.\u201d In this mode, the model can reference an image along with a prompt to offer more control over a video shot\u2019s composition. According to Fuentes, given a 1280 x 720-resolution image and 512-maximum-character prompt, Multishot Manual can generate videos containing up to 20 shots.\nNova Reel is only available through AWS platforms and services, including Bedrock, Amazon\u2019s AI dev suite, and customers must request access. As with most generative AI systems, there are questions as to whether Reel was developed using ethically sound methods.\nVideo-generating models are trained on a vast number of examples of videos to \u201clearn\u201d the patterns in these videos to generate new clips. Some companies train models on copyrighted videos without obtaining permission from the owners or creators, and, when these models \u201cregurgitate\u201d copyrighted stills, it exposes users of the models to IP lawsuits.\nAmazon hasn\u2019t revealed the source of Reel\u2019s training data, nor has it provided an explicit way for creators possibly feeding the models\u2019 datasets with their videos to opt out. The company has, however, said that it\u2019ll protect any AWS customers accused of violating copyright with media generated by its models, in keeping with its indemnification policy.\nUpdated 4:57 p.m. Pacific: An earlier version of this article implied that developers have to request special access from Amazon to use Nova Reel. That\u2019s incorrect; while developers have to request access, AWS automatically approves these requests. We regret the error.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI reportedly mulls buying Jony Ive and Sam Altman's AI hardware startup\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI is said to have discussed acquiring the AI hardware startup that former Apple design lead Jony Ive is building with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. According to The Information, OpenAI could pay around $500 million for the fledgling company, called io Products.\nIve, who left Apple in 2019 to start his own design firm called LoveFrom, confirmed that he was working with Altman on the AI hardware startup last year in an interview with The New York Times. io Products has raised an undisclosed amount of funding from Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Emerson Collective and others, according to The Information.\nThe Information\u2019s report notes that OpenAI may end up partnering with instead of acquiring io Products, which currently has a small team that includes former Apple designers Tang Tan and Evans Hankey. io Products has reportedly been working on different concepts of AI-enabled devices, including smart home gadgets. Last year, The New York Times said that the startup\u2019s goal was to build products that are \u201cless socially disruptive than the iPhone.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
