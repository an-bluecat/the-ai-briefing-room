Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The business model depends entirely on audiences retaining trust in individual creators. Given concerns about fragmentation in the creator-audience relationship, this could pose an existential threat to the company.\nBut a study commissioned from Northwestern University found that trust in creators increased 21% year-over-year, which was a pleasant surprise to Box.\n\u201cIf you asked me at the beginning of 2025, \u2018Hey, is trust in creators going to go up or down?\u2019 I would have probably said down, because people understand it\u2019s an industry \u2013 they understand how it\u2019s working,\u201d she said. \u201cBut actually, AI pushed people to kind of rotate trust to real humans that they know have real life experiences.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nBy that, Box means that consumers are more likely to go out of their way to see content from the creators they know and trust. According to the study, 97% of chief marketing officers intend to grow influencer marketing budgets in the new year.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that owning these relationships is straightforward. LTK creators, who rely on affiliate income, are betting this AI-induced skepticism will drive people toward more direct relationships through paid fan communities or less algorithmic platforms like LTK itself. For other kinds of creators, such as streamers, video podcasters, and short filmmakers, the strategy for owning their audience can more closely resemble growth hacking.\nTeenage clipping armies\nAs Sean Atkins, CEO of short-form video production company Dhar Mann Studios, put it, \u201cIn a world that\u2019s driven by AI and algorithms, where people trust another human being more in this micro atomization of attention, how do you market when you sort of can\u2019t control that?\u201d\nAccording to Eric Wei, cofounder of Karat Financial, a financial services company for creators, creators have a new secret weapon: armies of teenagers on Discord who creators pay to make clips of their content, which those same teenagers post en masse on algorithmic platforms.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been going on for a bit,\u201d Wei explained. \u201cDrake does it. A lot of the biggest creators and streamers in the world have been doing it \u2013 Kai Cenat [a top Twitch streamer] has done it \u2013 hitting millions of impressions\u2026 If it\u2019s algorithmically determined, clipping suddenly makes sense, because it can come from any random account that just has really good clips.\u201d\nWei thinks that clipping is going to become even more popular this year, since it\u2019s a reaction to this fragmentation in social media relationships. Even the biggest creators are finding it hard to reach their fans directly, which is why they turn to clipping. While going viral on these algorithmic feeds is certainly easier if you have a ton of followers, you don\u2019t need any track-record on a platform for it to decide that your video should be distributed more broadly. So, if these \u201cclippers\u201d post a short highlight from certain creators\u2019 streams, they can earn money based on how many views the video gets.\n\u201cClipping feels like an evolution of meme accounts,\u201d Glenn Ginsburg, president of QYOU Media, which produces content for young audiences, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s become a race among many creators to try and take this content and push it out far and wide, almost competing to see who can get the most views on the same IP.\u201d\nReed Duchscher \u2013 founding CEO of Night, the talent management company that represents Kai Cenat and other top creators \u2013 masterfully coaches creators through maximizing their virality. As MrBeast\u2019s former manager, Duchscher helped cultivate the fast-paced, attention-grabbing style that transformed MrBeast from a YouTuber to an empire. He\u2019s also behind Kai Cenat\u2019s clipping strategy, though Duchscher isn\u2019t quite as enthusiastic about its broader potential as Wei.\n\u201cClipping is important if you\u2019re a creator, because you do need to flood the zone with content, and it\u2019s a good way to get your face out there,\u201d Duchscher told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s also very hard to get to scale, because there\u2019s only so many clippers on the internet, so to spend large media budgets\u2026 there\u2019s just a lot of complications.\u201d\nPerhaps clipping only works now because the technique has not yet become so prevalent that it\u2019s seen as spam.\n\u201cThe creator wins because they get more of their content out,\u201d Wei said. \u201cThe clippers win because now this army of teenagers are getting paid. Everybody wins, except that if you take this to its logical conclusion, we just get lots and lots of slop.\u201d\nThe more niche, the better\nThe prevalence of slop on social media has become enough of a threat that Merriam-Webster called slop its word of the year.\n\u201cOver 94% of people are saying that social media is no longer social, and over half of them are rotating time elsewhere into smaller niche communities that they know are real and that they can talk to and interact with,\u201d Box said, pointing to platforms like Strava, LinkedIn, and Substack.\nAs the relationship between a creator and their audience becomes more difficult to maintain, Duchscher predicts that creators with more specific niches will succeed \u2013 he thinks that \u201cmacro creators\u201d like MrBeast, PewDiePie, or Charli D\u2019Amelio, who amass hundreds of millions of followers, will become even harder to emulate.\nPointing to success stories like like Alix Earle or Outdoor Boys, who have millions of followers but not necessarily mass appeal, Duchscher adds, \u201cAlgorithms have gotten so good at giving us exactly the content we want. It\u2019s much harder for a creator to break out into every niche algorithm.\u201d\nAtkins agrees, arguing that the creator economy extends far beyond entertainment. \u201cThe creator economy generally is viewed through this lens of entertainment. I think that\u2019s a mistake, because thinking about the creator economy is a little bit like thinking about the internet or AI \u2013 it\u2019s going to affect everything.\u201d\nAtkins mentions the gardening creator brand Epic Gardening as an example. What started as a YouTube channel has created a real, tangible presence in the world of gardening.\n\u201cEpic Gardening bought the third largest seed company in the United States, so now he\u2019s the third largest seed company [owner], as a content creator,\u201d he said.\nThough the creator economy is in flux, it\u2019s a resilient industry \u2013 one that\u2019s accustomed to navigating the whims of the algorithm, persisting onward for decades, even if the uninitiated may see it as a brand new realm.\nCreators are \u201cliterally impacting everything,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cI bet you there\u2019s a creator who\u2019s an expert at cement mixing for skyscrapers.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nWhy the electrical grid needs more software\ndescription1:\nOne of the nicest comments people have made about the electrical grid was \u2026 nothing. The grid works best when it fades into the background.\nThat low-profile status has changed in recent years as fires in California and freezes in Texas raised awareness of the electrical grid. But it was in 2025, when the electrical grid \u2014 and concerns about demand, supply, pricing, and the strain on natural resources \u2014 moved into the spotlight. And a new batch of startups have emerged with a software-as-a-solution pitch.\nElectricity rates are up 13% in this U.S. this year driven by an AI boom that has seeped into unlikely places, including repurposing supersonic jet engines for data center duty and working on beaming solar power down from space.\nAnd that pace of growth isn\u2019t expected to slow; the amount of electricity data centers use is projected to nearly triple in the coming decade. That forecast has fueled consumer frustration around pricing and drawn the ire of environmental groups that have called for a nationwide moratorium on new projects. Utilities, which have toiled away in the background, are now scrambling to upgrade the grid and build new power plants that can cope with the load \u2014 the fear of an AI bubble bursting always lingering in the background.\nThis confluence of demand and fear could give software startups a boost in the coming year.\nFor example, startups like Gridcare and Yottar argue that spare capacity already exists on the grid and that software can help find it.\nGridcare has gathered data on transmission and distribution lines, fiber-optic connections, extreme weather, and even community sentiment to optimize the search for new locations and convince utilities the grid can handle it. Already, the company says it has found several such sites that have been overlooked. Yottar finds places where known capacity exists and overlaps with the needs of medium-size users, helping them quickly connect amid the data center boom.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nSeveral other startups are using software to stitch together massive fleets of batteries scattered across the grid. Those startups can turns these fleets into virtual power plants to deliver power to the grid when it\u2019s needed most.\nBase Power, for example, is building one in Texas by leasing batteries to homeowners at relatively low prices. Homeowners can use the batteries for backup power in case of outages, while Base can tap into them to prevent outages by selling the aggregated capacity to the grid. Terralayr is doing something similar, though it doesn\u2019t sell batteries itself. Instead, Terralayr uses software to bundle distributed storage assets already installed on the German grid.\nOther startups, including Texture, Uplight, and Camus, are developing software layers to integrate and coordinate distributed energy sources like wind, solar, and batteries. The hope is that by orchestrating various assets, they will idle less and contribute more to the grid.\nThere\u2019s also some hope that software can help modernize some of the more outdated parts of the grid.\nNvidia, for example, has partnered with EPRI, a power industry R&D organization, to develop industry-specific models in the hopes they will improve efficiency and resiliency. Meanwhile, Google is working with the grid operator PJM to use AI to help sift through its backlog of connection requests from new sources of electricity.\nThese changes won\u2019t happen overnight, but 2026 could be the year when they begin to take hold.\nUtilities tend to be slow to adopt new technologies because of concerns about reliability. But they\u2019re also slow to invest in new infrastructure because it\u2019s costly and long-lived. Ratepayers and regulators have been known to balk when such projects begin to affect affordability.\nSoftware, though, is cheaper, and if it can clear the reliability hurdle, the companies offering it will have a good chance of gaining traction.\nAnd that could benefit more than the startups hawking software. Ultimately, the grid is going to need some refurbishment and expansion. Given the number of planned data centers and the electrification of broad swathes of the economy, including transportation, heating, and more, we will need more power. It would be foolish to ignore the power of software in these instances. It\u2019s cheap, flexible, and speedy to deploy.\n\ntitle2:\nHow to use the new ChatGPT app integrations, including DoorDash, Spotify, Uber, and others\ndescription2:\nOpenAI offers app integrations in ChatGPT to allow you to connect your accounts directly to ChatGPT and ask the assistant to do things for you. For instance, with a Spotify integration, you can tell it to create personalized playlists that will show up right in your Spotify app.\nTo get started, make sure you\u2019re logged into ChatGPT. Then type the name of the app you want to use at the start of your prompt, and ChatGPT will guide you through signing in and connecting your account.\nIf you want to set everything up at once, head over to the Settings menu, then click on Apps and Connectors. You can browse through the available apps, pick the ones you like, and it\u2019ll take you to the sign-in page for each one.\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that connecting your account means you\u2019re sharing your app data with ChatGPT. Make sure to review the permissions you\u2019re giving when you\u2019re linking your accounts. For example, if you connect your Spotify account, ChatGPT can see your playlists, listening history, and other personal information. (Sharing this info helps personalize the experience, but if you have privacy concerns, consider whether you\u2019re comfortable with this level of access before connecting.)\nYou can also disconnect any app whenever you want, right from the Settings menu.\nAvailable apps\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nBooking.com\nThis integration with the online travel giant is designed to help travelers, especially first-time visitors in need of suggestions for where to stay.\nOnce you link your Booking.com account, you can ask ChatGPT to find hotels in your preferred city based on your dates and budget. You can also specify how many people are coming and whether you want the hotel near public transport. ChatGPT aims to make this process more intuitive than searching directly on the Booking.com site. Plus, you can be more specific, like searching for options \u201cwith breakfast included.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Whether it\u2019s for a social media post, a poster, or a slide deck for a presentation, this may be a good way to help kickstart your project and brainstorm ideas.\nOnce you connect your Canva account, you can ask ChatGPT to design something like \u201ca 16:9 slide deck about our Q4 roadmap\u201d or \u201ca fun poster for a dog-walking business.\u201d You can include specifics such as the fonts you prefer, color schemes, formats (like Instagram posts or stories), and exact dimensions.\nAI-generated designs are seldom perfect, with occasional distorted images or spelling mistakes. However, some users may find this better than starting from scratch, and they can jump into Canva at any time to tweak their design and make it look just how they want.\nCoursera\nImage Credits:Coursera\nCoursera\u2019s integration is designed to help you quickly discover the best online courses for your skill level. For instance, you can then tell ChatGPT to find an \u201cintermediate-level course on Python.\u201d You can then tell the chatbot to compare course options by rating, duration, and cost before enrolling. ChatGPT can also provide a quick rundown of what exactly each course covers.\nDoorDash\nImage Credits:DoorDash\nDoorDash\u2019s newly launched ChatGPT integration aims to save time on meal planning and grocery shopping. Users can ask the chatbot for a meal plan and instantly add all ingredients to their DoorDash cart, then review and check out.\n\u200bCurrently, this feature is available only to users in the U.S., with participating grocery retailers, including Kroger, Safeway, Fairway Market, Wegmans, and more.\nExpedia\nImage Credits:Expedia\nChatGPT can display hotel options and flights via Expedia without leaving chat. Whether you\u2019re looking for a quick escape or a longer trip, it can find flights that fit your travel dates, budget, and number of travelers. You can narrow things down by saying stuff like \u201cOnly show 4-star hotels.\u201d Once you see something you like, go to Expedia to finalize everything and book your trip.\nFigma\nImage Credits:Figma\nTo use Figma in ChatGPT, you can ask it to generate diagrams, flow charts, and more. This is helpful for turning your ideas and brainstorming sessions into something more tangible. It may also be useful for visualizing complex concepts or workflows.\nYou can also upload files and ask the chatbot to generate a product roadmap for your team. This roadmap can include milestones, deliverables, and deadlines, helping your team stay organized and focused on their goals.\nSpotify\nImage Credits:Spotify\nOne of the most helpful aspects of using Spotify in ChatGPT is the ability to quickly create playlists and listen to new recommended songs tailored to your specific tastes. You can ask it to create a playlist based on your current mood, or just a playlist that only includes tracks by your favorite band.\nIt can also suggest new artists, playlists, audiobooks, and podcast episodes. Additionally, ChatGPT can perform actions on your behalf, including adding and removing items from your Spotify library.\nTarget\nImage Credits:Target\nRetail giant Target strategically launched a beta version of its ChatGPT integration before Black Friday. This feature allows shoppers to ask the chatbot for gift suggestions and quickly create a shopping basket with multiple items without leaving ChatGPT. For example, users can request ideas for a movie night, and the chatbot will provide a curated selection of available Target items. Shoppers can add these items to their cart and make a purchase using their Target account. They can then choose from same-day \u201cDrive Up,\u201d in-store pickup, or standard shipping.\nUber\nIf you\u2019re planning a trip, the Uber integration makes it easy to find ride options, which is especially useful if you\u2019re in a new country. You can set up your trip in the ChatGPT app, then complete the ride request and payment in the Uber app.\nCurrently, it\u2019s only available in the U.S., and it doesn\u2019t let you book rides in advance; only on-demand rides are available. You can choose from options like UberX, UberXL, Comfort, and Black.\nThere\u2019s also an Uber Eats integration for U.S. users, so you can check out local restaurants and menu items within ChatGPT, then finish paying in the Uber Eats app.\nZillow\nImage Credits:Zillow\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new home, Zillow in ChatGPT could make the search experience more straightforward. Using a simple text prompt, you can find homes that meet your criteria and apply filters to narrow the results. Whether you\u2019re looking for a specific price range, number of bedrooms, or particular neighborhoods, you can specify these details in your prompt, making the search process much more efficient and tailored to your needs.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nAlongside the announcement that OpenAI would bring apps into ChatGPT, the company also said it plans to welcome additional partners soon, including OpenTable, PayPal, and Walmart. These will launch in 2026.\nThe rollout of ChatGPT\u2019s app integrations is currently limited to the U.S. and Canada. Users in Europe and the U.K. are excluded for now.\nThis story has been updated to include newly launched integrations.\n\ntitle3:\nVCs predict strong enterprise AI adoption next year - again\ndescription3:\nIt\u2019s been three years since OpenAI released ChatGPT and kicked off a surge in innovation and attention on AI. Since then, optimists have regularly claimed that AI will become a critical part of the enterprise software industry, and so enterprise AI startups mushroomed on the back of immense amounts of investment.\nBut enterprises are still struggling to see the benefit of adopting these new AI tools. An MIT survey in August found that 95% of enterprises weren\u2019t getting a meaningful return on their investments in AI.\nSo when will businesses start seeing real benefits from using and integrating AI? TechCrunch surveyed 24 enterprise-focused VCs, and they overwhelmingly think 2026 will be the year when enterprises start to meaningfully adopt AI, see value from it, and increase their budgets for the tech.\nEnterprise VCs have been saying that for three years now. Will 2026 actually be different?\nLet\u2019s hear what they have to say:\nWhat enterprise-related trends do you expect to take off in 2026?\nKirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that LLMs are not a silver bullet for most problems. Just because Starbucks can use Claude to write their own CRM software doesn\u2019t mean they should. We\u2019ll focus on custom models, fine tuning, evals, observability, orchestration, and data sovereignty.\nMolly Alter, partner, Northzone: A subset of enterprise AI companies will shift from product businesses to AI consulting. These companies may start with a specific product, such as AI customer support or AI coding agents. But once they have enough customer workflows running off their platform, they can replicate the forward-deployed engineer model with their own team to build additional use cases for customers. In other words, many specialized AI product companies will become generalist AI implementers.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Voice is a far more natural, efficient, and expressive way for people to communicate with each other and with machines. We\u2019ve spent decades typing on computers and staring at screens, but speech is how we engage in the real world. I am eager to see how builders reimagine products, experiences, and interfaces with voice as the primary mode of interaction with intelligence.\nAlexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner, Inspired Capital: 2026 will be the year AI reshapes the physical world \u2014 especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, and climate monitoring. We are moving from a reactive world to a predictive one, where physical systems can sense problems before they become failures.\nLonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: We\u2019re watching how frontier labs approach the application layer. A lot of people assumed labs would just train models and hand them off for others to build on, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be how they are thinking about it. We may see frontier labs shipping more turnkey applications directly into production in domains like finance, law, healthcare, and education than people expect.\nTom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean: If I had to pick one word for quantum in 2026, it\u2019s momentum. Trust in quantum advantage is building fast, with companies publishing roadmaps to demystify the tech. But don\u2019t expect major software breakthroughs yet; we still need more hardware performance to cross that threshold.\nWhich areas are you looking to invest in?\nEmily Zhao, principal, Salesforce Ventures: We are targeting two distinct frontiers \u2014 AI entering the physical world and the next evolution of model research.\nMichael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Future datacenter technology.

This is going to continue in 2026 and beyond, in categories that include everything within the walls of the data center: cooling, compute, memory, and networking within and between sites.\nJonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Vertical enterprise software where proprietary workflows and data create defensibility, particularly in regulated industries, supply chain, retail, and other complex operational environments.\nAaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: We are at the limit of humanity\u2019s ability to generate enough energy to feed power-hungry GPUs. As an investor, I\u2019m looking for software and hardware that can drive breakthroughs in performance per watt. This could be better GPU management, more efficient AI chips, next-gen networking approaches like optical, or rethinking thermal load within AI systems and data centers.\nWhen it comes to AI startups, how do you determine that a company has a moat?\nRob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: A moat in AI is less about the model itself and more about economics and integration. We look for companies that are deeply embedded in enterprise workflows, have access to proprietary or continuously improving data, and demonstrate defensibility through switching costs, cost advantages, or outcomes that are difficult to replicate.\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: I\u2019m skeptical of moats built purely on model performance or prompting \u2014 those advantages erode in months. The question I ask: If OpenAI or Anthropic launches a model tomorrow and is 10x better, does this company still have a reason to exist?\nMolly Alter, partner, Northzone: It\u2019s much easier today to build a moat in a vertical category rather than a horizontal one. The best moats are data moats, where each incremental customer, data point, or interaction makes the product better. These are somewhat easier to build in specialized categories like manufacturing, construction, health, or legal, where data is more consistent across customers. But there are also interesting \u201cworkflow moats,\u201d where defensibility comes from understanding how a task or project moves from point A to point B in an industry.\nHarsha Kapre, director, Snowflake Ventures: For AI startups, the strongest moat comes from how effectively they transform an enterprise\u2019s existing data into better decisions, workflows, and customer experiences. Enterprises already sit on incredibly rich data; what they lack is the ability to reason over it in a targeted, trustworthy way. We look for startups that blend technical expertise with deep industry knowledge and can bring domain-specific solutions directly to a customer\u2019s governed data, without creating new silos, to deliver insights or automation that weren\u2019t previously possible.\nWill 2026 be the year when enterprises start to gain value from AI investments?\nKirby Winfield, founding general partner, Ascend: Enterprises are realizing that random experiments with dozens of solutions create chaos. They will focus on fewer solutions with more thoughtful engagement.\nAntonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The complexity here is that many enterprises, despite how ready or not they are to successfully use AI solutions, will say that they are increasing their investments in AI to explain why they are cutting back spending in other areas or trimming workforces. In reality, AI will become the scapegoat for executives looking to cover for past mistakes.\nScott Beechuk, partner, Norwest Venture Partners: We\u2019re definitely getting closer. If last year was about laying the infrastructure for AI, 2026 is when we begin to see whether the application layer can turn that investment into real value. As specialized models mature and oversight improves, AI systems are becoming more reliable in daily workflows.\nMarell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Yes, but still incremental. There is still a lot of iteration, and AI is still improving to the point of being able to showcase pain-point solutions for enterprises across a variety of industries. I believe solving simulation to reality training will likely open up many opportunities for a selection of industries, both existing and nascent.\nJennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: There have been sensational headlines this year about enterprises not seeing returns on their AI investments. Ask any software engineer if they would ever want to go back to the dark ages before they had AI coding tools. Unlikely. My point is, enterprises are already gaining value this year, and it will multiply across organizations next year.\nDo you think enterprises will increase their AI budgets in 2026?\nRajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: Yes, I believe they will, though it\u2019s nuanced. Rather than simply increasing AI budgets, organizations will shift portions of their labor spend toward AI technologies or generate such strong top-line ROI from AI capabilities that the investment effectively pays for itself three to five times over.\nRob Biederman, managing partner, Asymmetric Capital Partners: Budgets will increase for a narrow set of AI products that clearly deliver results and will decline sharply for everything else. Overall spend may grow, but it will be significantly more concentrated. We expect a bifurcation, where a small number of vendors capture a disproportionate share of enterprise AI budgets while many others see revenue flatten or contract.\nGordon Ritter, founder and general partner, Emergence Capital: Yes, but spend will concentrate. Enterprises will increase budgets where AI expands on institutional advantages, and pull back from tools that simply automate workflows without capturing (and securing!) proprietary intelligence.\nAndrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: 2026 will be the year that CIOs push back on AI vendor sprawl. Today, enterprises are testing out multiple tools for a single use case \u2014 monthly spend and switching costs are low in many cases, so the incentive to experiment is there \u2014 and there\u2019s an explosion of startups focused on certain buying centers like [go-to-market], where it\u2019s extremely hard to discern differentiation even during [proof of concepts]. As enterprises see real proof points from AI, they\u2019ll cut out some of the experimentation budget, rationalize overlapping tools, and deploy those savings into the AI technologies that have delivered.\nRyan Isono, managing director, Maverick Ventures: In aggregate, yes, and there will be some shifting from pilots/experimental budgets to budgeted line items. A boon for AI startups in 2026 will be the transition of enterprises who tried to build in-house solutions and have now realized the difficulty and complexity required in production at scale.\nWhat does it take to raise a Series A as an enterprise-focused AI startup in 2026?\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The best companies right now combine two things: a compelling \u201cwhy now\u201d narrative \u2014 usually tied to GenAI creating new attack surfaces, infrastructure needs, or workflow opportunities \u2014 and concrete proof of enterprise adoption. One million dollars to $2 million [annual recurring revenue] is the baseline, but what matters more than that is whether customers view you and your product as mission-critical to their business versus just being a nice-to-have. Revenue without narrative is a feature; narrative without traction is vaporware. You need both.\nLonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners: You should aim to show you\u2019re building in a space where the [total addressable market] expands rather than evaporates as AI drives down costs. Some markets have high elasticity of demand \u2014 a 90% price decline leads to a 10x increase in market size. Others have low elasticity, where dropping the price can vaporize the market, so the customers keep all of the value being created.\nJonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Customers are using the product in real, day-to-day operations and are willing to take reference calls and talk honestly about impact, reliability, and buying process, etc. Companies should be able to clearly show how the product saves time, reduces cost, or increases output in a way that holds up through security, legal, and procurement reviews.\nMichael Stewart, managing partner, M12: We (investors) were casting a doubtful eye towards [estimated annual recurring revenue] or pilot revenue until recently. Now it\u2019s not seen as much of an asterisk as much as the customer\u2019s interest and willingness to evaluate a solution in the face of so many options pushed their way. Getting those engagements and customer buy-in in terms of running an evaluation isn\u2019t just a matter of forward-deployed engineers making it easier for the customer. It takes quality and a winning marketing message to do it in 2026. Investors are expecting to see conversions become the leading part of the story after six months of pilot use.\nMarell Evans, founder and managing partner, Exceptional Capital: Execution and traction. The best signal is users genuinely delighted to use the product and the technical sophistication of the business. We look at a huge north star of real contractual agreements, 12+ months. In addition to that, was this founder able to attract top-tier talent to join their startup over competitors or the traditional hyper-scalers?\nWhat role will AI agents play at enterprises by the end of 2026?\nNnamdi Okike, managing partner and co-founder, 645 Ventures: Agents will still be in their initial adoption phase by the end of 2026. There are many technical and compliance hurdles that need to be overcome for enterprises to truly benefit from AI agents. There also need to be standards created for agent-to-agent communication.\nRajeev Dham, managing director, Sapphire: One universal agent will emerge. Today, each agent is siloed in its role \u2014 for example, inbound [sales development representative], outbound SDR, customer support, product discovery, etc. But by late next year, we\u2019ll start to see these roles converge into a single agent with shared context and memory, breaking down long-standing organizational silos, and enabling a more unified, contextual conversation between companies and their users.\nAntonia Dean, partner, Black Operator Ventures: The winners will be organizations that figure out the right balance of autonomy and oversight quickly and that recognize agent deployment as collaborative augmentation rather than a clean division of labor. Rather than agents handling all routine work while humans do all the thinking, we\u2019ll see more sophisticated collaboration between humans and agents on complex tasks, with the boundary between their roles continuously evolving.\nAaron Jacobson, partner, NEA: The majority of knowledge workers will have at least one agentic co-worker they know by name!\nEric Bahn, co-founder, general partner, Hustle Fund: I think that AI agents will probably be the bigger part of the workforce than any humans in enterprises. Proliferating AI agents is essentially free and zero marginal cost. So why not grow through bots?\nWhat kinds of companies in your portfolio are seeing the strongest growth?\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: The companies growing fastest are the ones that identified a workflow or security gap created by GenAI adoption, then executed relentlessly on product-market fit. In cybersecurity, it\u2019s tools addressing data security so LLMs can interact with sensitive data safely, and agent governance ensuring autonomous systems have appropriate controls. In marketing, it\u2019s new areas like Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) \u2014 getting discovered in AI responses, not just search results. The common thread: These weren\u2019t categories two years ago but are now must-haves for enterprises deploying AI at scale.\nAndrew Ferguson, vice president, Databricks Ventures: We\u2019re seeing growth tied to a few common themes. One is companies that land with focused use cases \u2014 companies that start with a narrower wedge (could be a focused target persona or use case), really nail it, become sticky and earn the right to expand from the initial wedge.\nJennifer Li, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz: Companies that help enterprises put AI into production are doing well. Areas like data extraction and structuring, developer productivity for AI systems, infrastructure for generative media, voice and audio for media, and apps like support or call centers.\nWhat kinds of companies are seeing the strongest retention?\nJake Flomenberg, partner, Wing Venture Capital: Companies with retention and expansion share a pattern \u2014 they solve problems that intensify as customers deploy more AI. Strong retention comes from three things: being mission-critical (removal breaks production workflows), accumulating proprietary context that\u2019s hard to re-create, and solving problems that grow with AI adoption rather than being one-and-done.\nTom Henriksson, general partner, OpenOcean: Retention is trickier to measure for younger companies, but the highest retention we\u2019re seeing is in the serious enterprise software providers, especially those enhanced with AI. A good example is Operations1, which digitizes employee-led production processes end-to-end. These companies go deep into the customer\u2019s organization, transform how they operate, and build up proprietary data and knowledge that makes them very hard to do without.\nMichael Stewart, managing partner, M12: Startups serving the enterprise in data tooling and vertical AI apps, with forward-deployed teams assisting in customer satisfaction, quality, and product improvement. This seems to be the winning formula that has been adopted by all leading startups in those markets. Longer term, the embedded teams might recede as the customers start to internalize the use of AI in their organizations and workday practices.\nJonathan Lehr, co-founder and general partner, Work-Bench: Retention is highest where software becomes foundational infrastructure rather than a point solution. AuthZed has strong retention because authorization and policy sit at the core of modern systems and are extremely costly to rip out once embedded. Courier Health and GovWell act as systems of record and orchestration layers for end-to-end workflows, patient journeys in healthcare, and permitting in government, which makes them deeply embedded once live.\n\ntitle4:\nThe 32 top enterprise tech startups from Disrupt Startup Battlefield\ndescription4:\nEvery year, TechCrunch\u2019s Startup Battlefield pitch contest draws thousands of applicants.
