Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

If the company attracts investors at the top of that range it will debut with a valuation of about $7.2 billion.\nThe Vermont-based company, which was founded in 2017 by its enigmatic CEO Kyle Clark, filed the paperwork Wednesday despite the government shutdown. The SEC issued guidance earlier this month that allows companies in IPO limbo to allow their statements on certain areas, including share price, to become automatically effective after 20 days, even without SEC staff review. Several other companies, including Navan, have pressed ahead with IPO plans under this rule.\nClark, a Harvard-educated former professional hockey player and pilot instructor, has not followed the typical path of a startup founder. He eschewed Silicon Valley for his Vermont hometown and took a different path to raising funds to develop and build electric aircraft. Beta has never taken venture capital, instead raising $1.15 billion in funds from institutional investors like Fidelity and Qatar Investment Authority.\nLast month, Beta Technologies announced a strategic deal with GE Aerospace to build a hybrid-electric turbogenerator for next-gen aircraft. GE Aerospace agreed to take a stake in the company and invest $300 million as part of the deal.\n\ntitle1:\nSelf-driving car companies Pony.ai and WeRide get the OK for Hong Kong listing\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nPony.ai and WeRide have received a key approval from Chinese securities regulators that clears the way for the autonomous vehicle technology companies to pursue secondary listings on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.\nThe Chinese companies, both of which are based in Guangzhou, are already publicly traded in the U.S. on the Nasdaq Exchange. WeRide made its public debut in October 2024, and Pony.ai followed a month later.\nNow, Pony.ai and WeRide are each aiming to sell shares on the Hong Kong Exchange, following a trend of Chinese companies that have pursued a secondary listing.\nPony.ai and WeRide said the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had issued a notice approving their proposed listing, according to regulatory filings reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The CSRC has the final authority to determine whether a company can go public overseas.\nBoth companies appear ready to proceed with their respective proposed global offering and listing. Reuters reported WeRide has hired Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corp. to work on a dual primary listing in Hong Kong, citing anonymous sources. WeRide plans to complete the listing in December.\n\ntitle2:\nSpotify spotted working on a 'SongDNA' feature that showcases the people behind your favorite music\ndescription2:\nSpotify has been spotted developing a \u201cSongDNA\u201d feature that would allow users to discover music through the credits \u2014 the writers, collaborators, vocalists, engineers, lyricists, producers, composers, and others who worked on a given track or album.\nThe feature was discovered in the app\u2019s code by reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who was able to generate screenshots of how SongDNA would appear in the app. Based on her findings, SongDNA would introduce a visual experience where you could essentially navigate through the credits, see how people were connected to each other, and explore their various works.\nSpotify is working on SongDNA, a new way for discovering the artists and crew behind each song pic.twitter.com/lweCwI9Ijp \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) October 11, 2025\nFor instance, Wong showed how one artist, Rei Ami from the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d cast, had lent her voice to other tracks beyond those from the movie.\nIf Spotify releases the feature to the public, it could challenge the streaming service TIDAL\u2019s interactive credits, which also lets you explore music through the contributors behind the songs you love. The addition could be useful for music industry pros looking for collaborators, as well as anyone wanting to learn more about the people who work behind the scenes in music creation.\nShortly after posting screenshots to social media, Wong said Spotify\u2019s app was updated to remove references to the SongDNA feature. Reached for comment, Spotify declined to share further details but did not issue a denial.\nFollowing Wong\u2019s post, another reverse engineer and technologist, Chris Messina, was able to confirm SongDNA\u2019s existence by finding references to the feature within the app\u2019s code. According to Messina, the lines of code suggest the feature could be used to reveal the network of contributors behind songs, allowing users to explore more of their work, he said.\nWhile some wondered if SongDNA would be Spotify\u2019s answer to Pandora\u2019s Music Genome Project, it appears that\u2019s not quite the case. The Genome Project uses hundreds of different details, or \u201ctraits,\u201d corresponding to a particular characteristic of the music to classify tracks and determine how they\u2019re related.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

A large chunk of the power they\u2019ll produce will go toward offsetting the energy used by Apple customers. Use of everything from Mac Pros to Apple Watches accounts for nearly one-third of the company\u2019s carbon footprint.\nEven though Europe isn\u2019t usually considered a sunny continent, Apple is buying energy from several solar farms, including 110 megawatts each in Greece and Latvia, 131 megawatts in Spain, and 40 megawatts in Poland. Wind farms will contribute 99 megawatts in Romania and a portion of the 129 megawatt solar-wind portfolio in Italy.\nSeparately, Apple also said it would invest $150 million in China to help its suppliers switch to renewable energy. Already, renewable sources power more than 90% of the company\u2019s manufacturing and production in the country.\nPerhaps most notable about these announcements is that they appear in the newsrooms of Apple\u2019s regional websites, but not in the feed of its U.S. press site. Previously, the company\u2019s press releases on regional renewable power purchases have appeared in that feed, perhaps out of a desire to not draw the ire of the Trump administration, which has been antagonistic to renewables.\nStill, solar and wind \u2014 and increasingly grid-scale batteries \u2014 have been the go-to source of energy for tech companies looking to power their operations.\nMicrosoft and Meta have also been consistent buyers of solar in particular. This year alone, Meta has added over 2 gigawatts of solar capacity, and Microsoft has signed deals that raise its total by 1.5 gigawatts.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWhile most big tech firms have pledged to move to renewable power, more practical considerations help drive such deals. Solar and wind are among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, undercutting coal and natural gas. When paired with batteries, which continue to drop in cost, they can provide firm, 24/7 power.\nThe other reason is speed: Solar farms can be built quickly, with a typical project requiring just 18 months to complete. What\u2019s more, they can be completed in phases, allowing part of the project to come online early. For tech companies, which are in a race to secure power for their data centers and AI operations, that speed can make a significant difference.\n\ntitle4:\nEightfold co-founders raise $35M for Viven, an AI digital twin startup for querying unavailable co-workers\ndescription4:\nWhile employees spend much of their day communicating and coordinating amongst themselves on projects, this effort is often undermined by the availability of specific individuals. When a colleague with vital information is away \u2014 whether on vacation or in a different time zone \u2014 the rest of the team must delay progress until that person responds.\nAshutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia, the co-founders of Eightfold \u2014 an AI recruiting startup last valued at $2.1 billion \u2014 believe that advances in LLMs and data privacy technologies can help solve some aspects of this costly problem. Earlier this year, they launched Viven, a digital twin startup with a mission to grant employees access to crucial information from teammates even when those colleagues are unavailable.\nOn Wednesday, Viven emerged out of stealth mode with $35 million in seed funding from Khosla Ventures, Foundation Capital, FPV Ventures, and others.\nViven develops a specialized LLM for each employee, effectively creating a digital twin by accessing their internal electronic documents such as email, Slack, and Google Docs. Other employees in the organization can then query that person\u2019s digital twin to get immediate answers related to common projects and shared knowledge.\n\u201cWhen each and every person has a digital twin, you can just talk to their twin as if you\u2019re talking to that person and get the response,\u201d Ashutosh Garg told TechCrunch.\nOne major hurdle is that people just can\u2019t share everything with anyone who asks. Employees often handle sensitive information or have personal files they want to keep private from the rest of the team.\nAccording to Ashutosh Garg, Viven\u2019s technology solves that complex problem through a concept known as pairwise context and privacy. This enables the startup\u2019s LLMs to precisely determine what information can be shared and with whom across the organization.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nViven\u2019s LLMs are smart enough to recognize personal context and know what information needs to stay private \u2014 like questions related to an employee\u2019s personal life. But perhaps the most important safeguard is that everyone can see the query history of their digital twin, which acts as a deterrent against people asking inappropriate questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard problem to solve, and until recently, it was unsolvable,\u201d Ashu Garg, a general partner at Foundation Capital told TechCrunch.\nViven is already in use by several enterprise clients, including Genpact and Eightfold. (Co-founders Ashutosh Garg and Varun Kacholia continue to lead Eightfold, splitting their time between that company and running Viven.)\nAs for competition, Ashutosh Garg claims that no other company is tackling digital twins for the enterprise yet.\nHe wasn\u2019t sure that there were no competitors when he first started thinking about the idea. So he called Vinod Khosla to ask about it. The legendary investor assured Ashutosh Garg that nobody is doing this and agreed to invest.\nAshu Garg of Foundation Capital was equally excited about Viven.\n\u201cWhen Ashutosh came to me and described the product, the big aha for me was: there\u2019s this horizontal problem across all jobs of coordination and communication, which no one is automating,\u201d Ashu Garg told TechCrunch.\nBut just because there are no direct competitors now doesn\u2019t mean that other companies won\u2019t build digital twins for companies in the future. Ashu Garg said that Anthropic, Google\u2019s Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and OpenAI\u2019s enterprise search products have a personalization component. But, if they do enter this market, Viven hopes its \u201cpairwise\u201d context technology will be its moat.\"\n\nResponse:",
