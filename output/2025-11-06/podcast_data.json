Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday November 7), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla shareholders approve Elon Musk's $1T pay package\ndescription0:\nTesla shareholders have overwhelmingly approved a compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth as much as $1 trillion in company shares.\nMore than 75% of shareholders who participated voted to approve the plan, in line with the amount of support Musk has received for past pay packages. As the result was announced, shareholders in the room at Tesla\u2019s Austin, Texas, factory began chanting: \u201cElon! Elon!\u201d\nFlanked by dancing Optimus robots, Musk said Thursday that \u201cwhat we\u2019re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book.\u201d\nUnder the deal, Musk will not be awarded $1 trillion right away. Nor will he receive a salary. But he stands to make hundreds of billions of dollars and gain more control of Tesla if he helps the company achieve a number of milestones and boost its profits along the way. Some of those hurdles will be difficult to clear. Many, though, are simply watered down versions of promises Musk has made for years.\nThe pay package is broken into 12 tranches \u2014 covering operational, adjusted profit, and market capitalization goals \u2014 each one giving more shares to Musk if those goals are reached. For instance, Tesla, which today has a market capitalization of about $1.5 trillion, will need to steadily increase that valuation and hit $8.5 trillion in a decade.\nThe vote followed two months of aggressive campaigning by Tesla, its board of directors, and many of its executives. The company repeatedly fired off public appeals for shareholders to approve the package. Chairwoman Robyn Denholm, who is typically media-shy, did multiple interviews with major news outlets and had lost some of her voice before addressing investors at Thursday\u2019s meeting. Tesla even ran television advertisements about the vote \u2014 something it doesn\u2019t even do for its cars.\n\u201cTesla is at an inflection point \u2014 I think I\u2019ve said that 3,000 times over the last few weeks \u2014 and this last year has been a critical one in our history,\u201d Denholm said Thursday.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nMusk encouraged shareholders to approve the package because, he claimed, it was the easiest way to hand him more voting control over the company. He currently owns around 15%, but he\u2019s threatened (multiple times) to leave Tesla if he doesn\u2019t wind up with around 25% control. That amount would insulate him from being pushed out and losing control of the \u201crobot army\u201d Tesla is building, Musk has said.\nTesla stumped for the package in part by holding up the company\u2019s \u201cMaster Plan 4\u201d as a visionary statement for where Musk can lead things. That document, released in September, was gauzy and unspecific \u2014 a criticism Musk even agreed with. He claimed Tesla would add more specifics to the \u201cPlan\u201d just a few days after it was released, but nothing has changed in the intervening months.\nTesla\u2019s board of directors put this pay package forward in large part because the previous plan from 2018 (worth around $56 billion) was struck down by Delaware\u2019s Chancery Court last year, after a judge ruled the company was not transparent about the negotiation process. Tesla has appealed the decision.\nEarlier this year, Tesla handed Musk $29 billion in shares to make up for the loss of the 2018 package, but said it would essentially void that amount should Tesla win on appeal.\n\ntitle1:\nSam Altman says OpenAI has $20B ARR and about $1.4 trillion in data center commitments\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nRarely has a month gone by in 2025 without OpenAI signing another multibillion-dollar data center deal. In a lengthy post on X on Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly clarified the totals.\n\u201cWe expect to end this year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate and grow to hundreds of billion by 2030. We are looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next 8 years,\u201d he wrote.\nWhile the post was largely a response to a brouhaha over comments his CFO made, and quickly walked back, concerning government-backstopped loans, Altman also listed a number of future business plans he believes will generate significant revenue.\nHe said OpenAI has an upcoming enterprise offering. Earlier this week, OpenAI said it already had a million business customers.\nHe named consumer devices and robotics. In May, OpenAI acquired Jony Ive\u2019s io, and they are reportedly working on a palm-sized AI device.\nAltman mentioned scientific discovery as an upcoming business. Not much is known about it yet, except that OpenAI VP Kevin Weil mentioned a newly launched OpenAI for Science some months ago.\nAltman also said OpenAI could become a cloud computing provider: \u201cWe are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of \u2018AI cloud\u2019, and we are excited to offer this.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThat\u2019s a bold idea for a company that doesn\u2019t yet have its own network of data centers.\nBeyond revenue, Altman noted that the company may also pay for its needs the old-fashioned way: selling more equity or taking on more loans.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta estimates that it earns 10% of its revenue from scams, report says\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nLast year, Meta projected that 10% of its overall annual revenue \u2014 $16 billion \u2014 would come from fraudulent advertisements on its apps, according to a report from Reuters.\nThe documents accessed by Reuters also show that for three years, Meta failed to protect its users from ads promoting illegal gambling, investment schemes, and banned medical products. These fraudulent ads purport to offer a product or service that isn\u2019t real and may be intended to solicit payments from less savvy users.\nImage Credits:Facebook (Screenshot by Reuters)\nMeta has a system for detecting the likelihood that an advertising campaign is a scam, but the company only deactivates an advertiser\u2019s account if it is 95% sure that the advertiser is committing fraud. Otherwise, Meta will charge more money from advertisers that it suspects may be doing fraud as a way to discourage them from buying more advertising \u2014 but when those advertisers follow through anyway, it pads Meta\u2019s bottom line.\nTechCrunch contacted Meta for comment but did not hear back before publication. Per Reuters\u2019 report, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone claimed that the documents Reuters used \u201cpresent a selective view that distorts Meta\u2019s approach to fraud and scams.\u201d\nStone added that over the last 18 months, Meta has reduced user reports of scam ads by 58%, and the company has removed over 134 million scam ads from its platforms.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle to buy carbon credits from massive Amazonian reforestation project\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nGoogle announced Thursday it is buying 200,000 metric tons of carbon removal from Mombak, a forest restoration company based in Brazil. The project will buy farmland in the Amazon and reforest it.\nThe deal was made through the Symbiosis Coalition, an advance market commitment intended to develop a market for nature-based carbon removal schemes that is backed by Google, McKinsey, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce. Symbiosis Coalition is similar to Frontier, an advance market commitment also backed by Google and others that supports direct air capture projects.\nNature-based carbon removal shows great promise in drawing down CO 2 levels in the atmosphere, but projects have been challenging to develop and sell for a variety of reasons. Nature-based projects risk falling short of their goals if they\u2019re damaged by wildfires or other disasters, and it can be challenging to guarantee their long-term viability.\nStill, they come with many upsides: Forests can replenish aquifers and support biodiversity, neither of which direct air capture can do. Google said it will use its DeepMind Perch AI to help quantify biodiversity benefits of the project.\"\n\nResponse:",
