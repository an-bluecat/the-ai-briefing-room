That growth was largely fueled by AI-dominated data center business, which saw a 56% year-over-year increase in revenue.\nNvidia also saw its net income grow substantially since last year. The company reported a net income of $26.4 billion in the second quarter, a 59% spike since the same period last year.\nAll told, the company brought in $41.1 billion in revenue from data center sales in the quarter, suggesting that AI companies\u2019 demand for cutting-edge GPUs continues to grow. The company\u2019s most advanced generation of chips, Blackwell, accounted for $27 billion of those sales.\n\u201cBlackwell is the AI platform the world has been waiting for,\u201d said CEO Jensen Huang in a statement accompanying the release. \u201cThe AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its center.\u201d\nHuang said that the company expects to see $3 to 4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. \u201c$3 to 4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next five years,\u201d he told one analyst.\nThe company made particular note of its role in the launch of OpenAI\u2019s open source gpt-oss models earlier this month, which involved processing \u201c1.5 million tokens per second on a single Nvidia Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system.\u201d\nThe earnings also gave a look at Nvidia\u2019s ongoing struggle to sell its chips in Chinese markets. The company reported no sales of its China-focused H20 chip to Chinese customers in the past quarter; Nvidia did report $650 million worth of H20 chips had been sold to a customer outside China.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe United States has long restricted sales of advanced GPUs to Chinese customers \u2014 but the geopolitical situation has changed significantly under President Trump. The company is now permitted to sell chips to China as long as it pays a 15% export tax to the U.S. Treasury, as a result of an unconventional arrangement that legal scholars have described as an unconstitutional abuse of power.\nOn the earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress made clear that the lack of shipment was a result of uncertainty around the arrangement, which has not been officially codified into a federal regulation. \u201cWhile a select number of our China-based customers have received licenses over the past few weeks,\u201d Kress said, \u201cwe have not shipped any H20 devices based on those licenses.\u201d\nStill, the Chinese government has officially discouraged the use of Nvidia chips by local businesses, leading the company to reportedly halt production of the H20 chip earlier this month.\nNvidia said it expects $54 billion in revenue in the third quarter. The company noted that its outlook for the third quarter, which could shift 2% in either direction, doesn\u2019t include any H20 shipments to China.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle and Grok are catching up to ChatGPT, says a16z's latest AI report\ndescription1:\nChatGPT rivals like Google\u2019s Gemini, xAI\u2019s Grok, and, to a lesser extent, Meta AI, are closing the gap to ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s popular AI chatbot, according to a new report focused on the consumer AI landscape from venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.\nThe report, in its fifth iteration, showcases two and a half years of data about consumers\u2019 evolving use of AI products.\nAnd for the fifth time, 14 companies appeared on the list of top AI products: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Poe, Character AI, Midjourney, Leonardo, Veed, Cutout, ElevenLabs, Photoroom, Gamma, QuillBot, Civitai, and Hugging Face.\nImage Credits:a16z\nThe companies represent a cross section of how consumers are using AI: for general assistance, companionship, image and video editing, voice generation, productivity, and model hosting.\nFive other companies appeared on all but the first report, the firm notes, including Claude, DeepAI, Janitor AI, Pixelcut, and Suno, representing general AI use, companionship, image editing, and music generation.\nImage Credits:a16z\nFor the first time in the series of reports, Google gained four spots on the list of the top generative AI consumer web products with entries for Gemini, AI Studio, NotebookLM, and Google Labs. These products now have their own separate domains, allowing their growth to be tracked separately from one another.\nAndreessen Horowitz says its report relies on data from third-party market intelligence firms, including Similarweb, for web products and Sensor Tower for mobile app data.\nImage Credits:a16z\nOf note, No. 2 app Gemini is closing the gap to No. 1 app ChatGPT on mobile devices, but with almost half as many monthly active users. Not surprisingly, Gemini\u2019s AI technology sees stronger adoption on Android, with nearly 90% of the monthly active user base. On the web, Gemini also came in second place behind ChatGPT, with approximately 12% of ChatGPT\u2019s visits.\nImage Credits:a16z\nThe company\u2019s AI Studio, a developer-oriented sandbox for building with Gemini models, entered the top 10 list of AI web products, sitting in the 10th spot; NotebookLM was No. 13. Google Labs, a destination for Google\u2019s AI experiments (e.g., Flow, Project Mariner, and Doppl), ranked at No. 39.\nImage Credits:a16z\nThe report indicates that Meta AI and Grok are also chasing the top AI app, ChatGPT.\nGrok ranked fourth on the web and No. 23 on mobile. This is quick growth, given that Grok went from having no stand-alone app at the end of 2024 (it was first launched on X) to now, with upward of 20 million monthly active users. In July 2025, Grok also climbed nearly 40% when Grok 4 was released.\nImage Credits:a16z\nMeta\u2019s general assistant ranked No. 46 on the web \u2014 the same as in March \u2014 but it didn\u2019t make the list of top mobile AI apps. In part, it was hampered by the news that Meta AI was sharing some users\u2019 posts publicly on the web without their informed consent.\nImage Credits:a16z\nDeepSeek and Claude also saw their growth flatten on mobile, with the former falling off its peak by 22%. On the web, DeepSeek saw an even sharper drop-off, down more than 40% from its peak in February 2025. Perplexity and Claude, however, continued to grow.\nOther Chinese AI makers also made the top 20 on the web, including No. 9 Quark, Alibaba\u2019s AI assistant (No. 47 on the mobile list); No. 12 Doubao, ByteDance\u2019s general LLM product (No. 4 on mobile); and No. 17 Kimi, a chatbot from Moonshot AI. Each of these has a Chinese website and sees 75% of its traffic coming from China.\nSeven additional companies on the web list were developed in China but exported their AI tech globally: DeepSeek, Hailuo, Kling, SeaArt, Cutout Pro, Manus, and Monica.\nOn mobile, 22 of the 50 top apps were developed in China, but only three were primarily used in China. Top players here include Meitu (Photo & Video Editor, BeautyPlus, BeautyCam, Wink, and Airbrush), ByteDance (Doubao and Cici), Gauth, and Hypic.\nVibe-coding startups Lovable and Replit both debuted on the main list this time, having not made the cut on a16z\u2019s list published back in March of this year. (Note that websites built and published via Replit and via Lovable without custom domains appear under traffic for replit.app and lovable.app, respectively, helping them gain traction.)\nImage Credits:a16z\nAndreessen Horowitz also took time to call out AI apps that were on the brink of making the list of top AI apps, including PixAI, Bolt, Blackbox AI, Clipchamp, and Getliner on the web and Talkie, Seekee, Photo AI, AI Mirror, and Arvin on mobile.\nThe firm notes that the mobile list in this month\u2019s report already features more newcomers (14) than before, as both app stores have long since cracked down on ChatGPT copycats and clones, allowing for more original apps to find their footing.\n\ntitle2:\nWhatsApp's new AI feature lets you rephrase and adjust the tone of your messages\ndescription2:\nWhatsApp is launching a new AI feature that allows users to rephrase, proofread, or adjust the tone of their messages, the Meta-owned company announced on Wednesday.\nThe new feature, called \u201cWriting Help,\u201d uses Meta\u2019s Private Processing technology, which allows users to receive AI-generated responses without Meta or WhatsApp reading the original message or the suggested rewrites. This means that messages on the platform remain private even if people use the new tool.\nWith Writing Help, users can get AI-generated suggestions that rewrite their messages in a professional, funny, supportive, or rephrased way.\nWhatsApp showcased the feature in a product image displaying a user\u2019s original message: \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave dirty socks on the sofa.\u201d The AI then offers \u201cfunny\u201d rewrites, such as: \u201cPlease don\u2019t make the sofa a sock graveyard,\u201d \u201cBreaking news: Socks found chilling on the couch. Please move them,\u201d and \u201cHey, sock ninja, the laundry basket is that way!\u201d\nImage Credits:WhatsApp\nWith this launch, WhatsApp is likely hoping that people use its in-app technology when drafting messages, rather than external tools like ChatGPT.\nOf course, not everyone will be fond of the new feature, as users likely prefer authentic, personal conversations with friends and family over AI-generated messages. Using AI to rewrite an email is one thing; using it to message your grandma is another.\nWhatsApp says users can access the new feature by tapping the new pencil icon that appears when drafting a message in the app.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWriting Help is rolling out in English in select countries starting Wednesday.\n\ntitle3:\nFBI says China's Salt Typhoon hacked at least 200 US companies\ndescription3:\nA Chinese-backed hacking campaign that previously hacked into nine U.S. telecommunication and internet providers is now confirmed to have hacked at least 200 American companies, according to the FBI\u2019s top cyber chief.\nFBI assistant director Brett Leatherman told The Washington Post that the hackers, dubbed Salt Typhoon, also broke into companies in 80 countries, revealing for the first time the global scale of the Chinese spying campaign.\nLeatherman didn\u2019t name the hacked companies. AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen were previously confirmed as breached, and Charter Communications and Windstream were later named as victims, among others.\nThe hackers targeted call records among senior American politicians and officials, allowing them to map out who was calling who, and on whom the U.S. was snooping with legal orders. For a time, the threat was so severe that the FBI urged Americans to switch to encrypted messaging apps to avoid having their calls and messages accessed.\nThe FBI, along with nearly two dozen international agencies, said in an advisory [PDF] published Wednesday that Salt Typhoon primarily targets company routers and siphons sensitive network traffic, and offered technical guidance on how to identify intrusions.\nLeatherman told the Post that the threat from China is \u201congoing.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI co-founder calls for AI labs to safety-test rival models\ndescription4:\nOpenAI and Anthropic, two of the world\u2019s leading AI labs, briefly opened up their closely guarded AI models to allow for joint safety testing \u2014 a rare cross-lab collaboration at a time of fierce competition. The effort aimed to surface blind spots in each company\u2019s internal evaluations and demonstrate how leading AI companies can work together on safety and alignment work in the future.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba said this kind of collaboration is increasingly important now that AI is entering a \u201cconsequential\u201d stage of development, where AI models are used by millions of people every day.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a broader question of how the industry sets a standard for safety and collaboration, despite the billions of dollars invested, as well as the war for talent, users, and the best products,\u201d said Zaremba.\nThe joint safety research, published Wednesday by both companies, arrives amid an arms race among leading AI labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, where billion-dollar data center bets and $100 million compensation packages for top researchers have become table stakes. Some experts warn that the intensity of product competition could pressure companies to cut corners on safety in the rush to build more powerful systems.\nTo make this research possible, OpenAI and Anthropic granted each other special API access to versions of their AI models with fewer safeguards (OpenAI notes that GPT-5 was not tested because it hadn\u2019t been released yet). Shortly after the research was conducted, however, Anthropic revoked the API access of another team at OpenAI. At the time, Anthropic claimed that OpenAI violated its terms of service, which prohibits using Claude to improve competing products.\nZaremba says the events were unrelated and that he expects competition to stay fierce even as AI safety teams try to work together. Nicholas Carlini, a safety researcher with Anthropic, tells TechCrunch that he would like to continue allowing OpenAI safety researchers to access Claude models in the future.\n\u201cWe want to increase collaboration wherever it\u2019s possible across the safety frontier, and try to make this something that happens more regularly,\u201d said Carlini.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOne of the most stark findings in the study relates to hallucination testing. Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4 models refused to answer up to 70% of questions when they were unsure of the correct answer, instead offering responses like, \u201cI don\u2019t have reliable information.\u201d Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s o3 and o4-mini models refuse to answer questions far less, but showed much higher hallucination rates, attempting to answer questions when they didn\u2019t have enough information.\nZaremba says the right balance is likely somewhere in the middle \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s models should refuse to answer more questions, while Anthropic\u2019s models should probably attempt to offer more answers.\nSycophancy, the tendency for AI models to reinforce negative behavior in users to please them, has emerged as one of the most pressing safety concerns around AI models.\nIn Anthropic\u2019s research report, the company identified examples of \u201cextreme\u201d sycophancy in GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4 \u2014 in which the models initially pushed back on psychotic or manic behavior, but later validated some concerning decisions. In other AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic, researchers observed lower levels of sycophancy.\nOn Tuesday, parents of a 16-year-old boy, Adam Raine, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o) offered their son advice that aided in his suicide, rather than pushing back on his suicidal thoughts. The lawsuit suggests this may be the latest example of AI chatbot sycophancy contributing to tragic outcomes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine how difficult this is to their family,\u201d said Zaremba when asked about the incident. \u201cIt would be a sad story if we build AI that solves all these complex PhD level problems, invents new science, and at the same time, we have people with mental health problems as a consequence of interacting with it. This is a dystopian future that I\u2019m not excited about.\u201d\nIn a blog post, OpenAI says that it significantly improved the sycophancy of its AI chatbots with GPT-5, compared to GPT-4o, claiming the model is better at responding to mental health emergencies.\nMoving forward, Zaremba and Carlini say they would like Anthropic and OpenAI to collaborate more on safety testing, looking into more subjects and testing future models, and they hope other AI labs will follow their collaborative approach.\nUpdate 2:00pm PT: This article was updated to include additional research from Anthropic that was not initially made available to TechCrunch ahead of publication.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?
