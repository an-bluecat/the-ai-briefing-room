Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Luminar cut about 30% of its workforce in 2024, a reduction that was expected to cost $4 million to $6 million in additional cash charges. Some of those layoffs spilled into the first quarter of 2025. A total of 212 employees were laid off.\nIn its latest regulatory filing, the company said it began additional layoffs May 15. These new layoffs are expected to cost $4 million to $5 million in cash charges. These costs are expected to be incurred in the second and third quarters of this year.\nThe layoffs are the latest complication for Luminar. Earlier this month, the company\u2019s board replaced Russell as CEO and board chair. The board issued a press release saying he resigned as the result of an ethics inquiry without providing any additional information. Luminar\u2019s board replaced Russell and appointed Paul Ricci to the role. Ricci is the former chairman and CEO of Nuance.\nA day after the leadership change was announced, board member Jun Hong Heng also resigned, according to a regulatory filing, which stated his decision was not due to any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to the company\u2019s operations, policies, or practices.\nThe company has not responded to requests for comment.\nRussell became a billionaire after his lidar startup Luminar went public in 2021 after the company merged with special purpose acquisition company Gores Metropoulos Inc., with a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Luminar raised $250 million prior to the SPAC announcement.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Google says it will invest an additional $75 million, taking an equity stake in Warby Parker, should the eyewear manufacturer meet certain milestones.\nAt Google I/O 2025, Google also announced partnerships with several companies to develop smart glasses with Gemini AI and AR capabilities, including Samsung and Gentle Monster.\nGoogle seems to be taking a page out of Meta\u2019s smart glasses strategy. Meta has found success partnering and investing in the Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica to develop its smart glasses. Part of the reason behind Ray-Ban Meta\u2019s success is that the smart glasses have an attractive, familiar design and they\u2019re being sold in Ray-Ban stores. It seems likely that Google will have a similar relationship with Warby Parker, taking advantage of the eyewear company\u2019s popular frame designs and perhaps its retail stores.\nIn the press release, Warby Parker and Google said they intend to launch a series of products over time. Their first line of eyewear will launch \u201cafter 2025\u201d and will incorporate multimodal AI with prescription and non-prescription glasses.\n\ntitle2:\nIntel is reportedly exploring a sale for its networking and edge unit\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan continues to consider ways to help semiconductor giant refocus on its core business.\nIntel is allegedly considering selling its networking and edge unit, according to reporting to Reuters, as Tan looks to shed business divisions that aren\u2019t considered critical. This unit builds makes chips for telecom equipment and was responsible for $5.8 billion of revenue in 2024.\nIntel has started engaging with potential buyers but has not launched a formal sales process, Reuters reported.\nIf Intel does end up pursuing a sale, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising. Tan has made it clear that he wants the company to refocus on its core business units \u2014 PCs and data center chips. In March, Tan told Intel\u2019s customers that the company would spin off its non-core assets at the company\u2019s Intel Vision conference.\nIntel declined to comment.\n\ntitle3:\nThe latest Google Gemma AI model can run on phones\ndescription3:\nGoogle\u2019s family of \u201copen\u201d AI models, Gemma, is growing.\nDuring Google I/O 2025 on Tuesday, Google took the wraps off Gemma 3n, a model designed to run \u201csmoothly\u201d on phones, laptops, and tablets. Available in preview starting Tuesday, Gemma 3n can handle audio, text, images, and videos, according to Google.\nModels efficient enough to run offline and without the need for computing in the cloud have gained steam in the AI community in recent years. Not only are they cheaper to use than large models, but they preserve privacy by eliminating the need to transfer data to a remote data center.\nDuring a keynote at I/O, Gemma Product Manager Gus Martins said that Gemma 3n can run on devices with less than 2GB of RAM. \u201cGemma 3n shares the same architecture as Gemini Nano, and is and is engineered for incredible performance,\u201d he added.\nIn addition to Gemma 3n, Google is releasing MedGemma through its Health AI Developer Foundations program. According to the company, MedGemma is its most capable open model for analyzing health-related text and images.\n\u201cMedGemma [is] our [\u2026] collection of open models for multimodal [health] text and image understanding,\u201d Martins said. \u201cMedGemma works great across a range of image and text applications, so that developers [\u2026] can adapt the models for their own health apps.\u201d\nAlso on the horizon is SignGemma, an open model to translate sign language into spoken-language text. Google says that SignGemma will enable developers to create new apps and integrations for deaf and hard-of-hearing users.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cSignGemma is a new family of models trained to translate sign language to spoken-language text, but it\u2019s best at American Sign Language and English,\u201d Martins said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most capable sign language understanding model ever, and we can\u2019t wait for you \u2014 developers and deaf and hard-of-hearing communities \u2014 to take this foundation and build with it.\u201d\nWorth noting is that Gemma has been criticized for its custom, non-standard licensing terms, which some developers say have made using the models commercially a risky proposition. That hasn\u2019t dissuaded developers from downloading Gemma models tens of millions of times collectively, however.\nUpdated 2:40 p.m. Pacific: Added several quotes from Gemma Product Manager Gus Martins.\n\ntitle4:\nMusk says Tesla's self-driving tests will be geofenced to 'the safest' parts of Austin\ndescription4:\nThe first test of Tesla\u2019s long-promised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas next month will initially be limited to specific areas the company deems \u201cthe safest,\u201d CEO Elon Musk told CNBC in an interview Tuesday.\nTesla\u2019s cars are \u201cnot going to take intersections unless we are highly confident [they\u2019re] going to do well with that intersection, or it\u2019ll just take a route around that intersection,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be extremely paranoid about the deployment, as we should be. It would be foolish not to be.\u201d\nUsing a geofence represents a major strategy shift for Musk, who spent years claiming his company would be able to create a general purpose self-driving solution that could be dropped in to any location and work without human supervision. (Geofence is a jargon term used in the autonomous vehicle industry that means vehicle is restricted to a certain area.) Musk has claimed Tesla will attempt to launch similar trials for its robotaxi service in California and possibly other states later this year.\nMusk telegraphed the idea of using a geofence on Tesla\u2019s first-quarter earnings call in April, though he did not explicitly say that was the approach the company would use. The CEO said at the time that it was \u201cincreasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set\u201d for its early robotaxi operations.\nAs part of Tesla\u2019s \u201cparanoid\u201d approach, Musk said Tuesday the company will have employees remotely monitor the initial fleet of around 10 Model Y SUVs equipped with the \u201cunsupervised\u201d version of its Full Self-Driving software. Musk also claimed those vehicles will be driving without any safety operator inside.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s prudent for us to start with a small number, confirm that things are going well, and then scale it up proportionate to how well we see it\u2019s doing,\u201d he said.\nIt is common practice for autonomous vehicle companies like Waymo to have an operations center staffed with people who are monitoring their robotaxis and providing remote guidance, if needed. Waymo, which posted a blog on the topic in 2024, doesn\u2019t take take control of the vehicles though. Instead human employees primarily communicate through questions and answers with the self-driving system to give it proper context and help it problem solve.\"\n\nResponse:",
