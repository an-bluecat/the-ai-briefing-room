Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday July 25), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nVC Victor Lazarte is leaving Benchmark to launch his own firm\ndescription0:\nAfter two years as a venture capitalist for top-shelf firm Benchmark, Victor Lazarte is leaving that company to start his own investing gig, he announced on X on Thursday.\nLazarte became known in tech for co-founding mobile gaming company Wildlife Studios, which was last valued at an estimated $3 billion in 2020. Wildlife raised money from a multitude of VCs, including Benchmark.\nDuring his two years at Benchmark, Lazarte invested in recruiting and data labeling startup Mercor, AI video intelligence platform HeyGen, and AI infrastructure company Decart AI.\nLazarte is leaving Benchmark to \u201cbuild a new investment practice,\u201d he wrote in the post. He had recently informed his portfolio companies about his plans to leave Benchmark, according to a source.\nLazarte is the second investor to step down from Benchmark\u2019s partnership this year. Sarah Tavel announced in April that she is transitioning to a venture partner.\nAfter Lazarte\u2019s departure, remaining partners at the storied firm include Peter Fenton, Eric Vishria, and Chetan Puttagunta.\nUnlike most VC firms, where senior partners typically receive a greater share of management fees and profits, Benchmark operates as an equal partnership, with all general partners dividing fees and returns equally. Benchmark and Lazarte did not immediately respond to our request for additional comment.\n\ntitle1:\nIntel continues to pull back on its manufacturing projects\ndescription1:\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is making progress on his plan for the company to shed its inefficiencies. And that includes spiking several manufacturing projects.\nThe semiconductor giant reported Thursday in its second-quarter earnings report that it will delay, and in some cases not move forward with, multiple manufacturing projects. Specifically, Intel said it was no longer going forward with its previously announced projects in Germany and Poland. Those projects included an assembly and testing facility in Poland and a chip factory in Germany. Both projects have been sitting in limbo since being suspended in 2024, shortly after being announced.\nThe company also plans to consolidate its test operations in Costa Rica and concentrate these operations to its sites in Vietnam and Malaysia.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the capacity investment we make over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive,\u201d Tan said on the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call. \u201cOur factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented. Going forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments and deploy capex lockstep with the tangible milestones, and not before.\u201d\nIntel also said it was going to further delay its $28 billion Ohio chip factory. The factory was initially supposed to open in 2025 and was already delayed once this year in February.\nThe second quarter was the first full quarter with Tan at the helm of Intel. He was named CEO of the semiconductor company on March 12 and started the role a week later. Shortly after, Tan said his plan was to eliminate inefficiencies at the company by selling off its noncore units and streamlining operations.\n\u201cWe have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organization, which we have started in earnest, and it remain an area of focus for me during Q3,\u201d Tan said on the Q2 earnings call. \u201cOur goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe company also gave an update on its workforce, which has gone through several rounds of layoffs. Intel reduced its workforce by about 15% and plans to end the year with 75,000 employees, the company said. Intel was able to eliminate 50% of management layers through its recent layoffs, Tan said.\nIntel announced in June in an internal memo that it was going to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry unit, which designs and manufactures chips for external clients. The company had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, according to the company\u2019s annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That\u2019s down from the 124,800 people it employed at the end of 2023.\n\ntitle2:\nApple iOS 26 public beta arrives\ndescription2:\nApple released the first public beta of its new mobile operating system, iOS 26, featuring its \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d user interface and improved AI features. The release allows early adopters to get their hands on Apple\u2019s latest software before its wider public availability later this fall.\nThe update represents the most notable visual transformation since iOS 7, featuring a \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d design that offers a more transparent, glass-like feel to user interface elements, like buttons, screens, and in-app navigation and controls, among other things. Liquid Glass is integrated throughout iOS 26, including in key apps like Phone, Camera, Safari, Music, and others, as well as in notifications, the Lock Screen, Control Center, and the Home Screen.\nThe software update also includes an redesigned Lock Screen for iPhone and iPad with a 3D photo effect and dynamic clock and updated app icons, which users can now set to clear, too.\nIn terms of AI features, the new software brings a live translation feature that translates conversations in real time, AI-powered shortcuts, poll suggestions in Messages, and an update to Visual Intelligence for conducting image searches as you browse.\nOther software versions, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26, have also adopted the Liquid Glass design.\nHere is a brief overview of all the new features being introduced.\niOS 26\nImage Credits:Apple\nIn addition to the glass aesthetic, iPhone users have several updates to be excited about, including a dedicated gaming app that serves as a new destination for playing and discovering games in one place.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Additionally, a Hold Assist feature will notify users when hold music ends, signaling that they can speak to a live agent. The app, along with Messages and FaceTime, will also support real-time live translations. In the Messages app, meanwhile, users can expect a feature that has AI-generated suggestions for polls.\nIn addition, iOS 26 will bring updates to Genmoji and Image Playground, as well as improvements to Camera, Photos, Maps, and a range of other minor additions, including the ability to customize alarm snooze times.\niPadOS 26\nImage Credits:Apple\nA big win for iPad users is that they\u2019ll experience a more Mac-like tablet. For example, iPadOS 16 is bringing the Preview app from macOS, which enables annotation on PDFs. Plus, a new windowing system that lets users adjust the size of web pages and apps, as well as manage multiple windows and tabs at once.\nmacOS Tahoe 26\nImage Credits:Apple\nOne notable update for macOS 26 involves Spotlight, which will employ AI to anticipate user searches and suggest actions based on frequently performed tasks or ongoing projects. Additionally, macOS is gaining Live Activities, allowing users to sync activities directly with their iPhones and access recent calls and contacts.\nwatchOS 26\nImage Credits:Apple\nOne of the more significant features coming to the new watchOS is Workout Buddy, a fitness assistant powered by Apple Intelligence that provides motivation using a generative AI voice during workouts, pointing out key moments like closing the Exercise ring for the day.\nApple has also revamped the Workout app, introducing a helpful new option called Autoplay Media. This feature automatically starts playing music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Additionally, Apple Music can intelligently recommend the most suitable playlists for your workouts and will recall listening habits for each type of exercise.\nAnother update is the automatic volume adjustment capability, which adjusts the volume of calls, timers, alarms, and Siri to match the surrounding sound levels, ideal for quiet places like libraries.\nApple also introduced a new one-handed flick gesture that\u2019s designed to dismiss notifications, silence incoming calls, and return to the watch face, among other actions.\ntvOS 26\nImage Credits:Apple\nArguably, the most useful new feature coming to Apple\u2019s TV operating system is the ability to switch profiles seamlessly. Users can easily select their profile as soon as the Apple TV wakes from sleep, allowing them to quickly resume their viewing experience.\nApple Music introduced a fun feature that enables users to use their iPhones as microphones for sing-alongs, complete with on-screen lyrics displayed on the TV. Multiple iPhones can connect at once, making it possible for friends and family to join in, queue songs, and even send emoji reactions.\nAdditionally, new Contact Posters for FaceTime allow users to showcase customized photos and names, personalizing the experience. Another notable update includes the expansion of Live Captions to support translations in languages such as French, German, and Spanish.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle's new Web Guide search experiment organizes results with AI\ndescription3:\nGoogle on Thursday is launching a new AI-powered feature called Web Guide for organizing Google Search results. Web Guide is a Search Labs experiment that leverages AI technology to organize the search results page by grouping pages related to specific aspects of the search query.\nSearch Labs experiments are a way for Google to test out new ideas by letting users opt in to those they find interesting. The experiments can be turned on or off at any time and include things like Google\u2019s AI Mode, Notebook LM, filmmaking tool Flow, and other, more niche ideas, like an audio show based on news from your Google Discover feed.\nThe new Web Guide experiment is a variation on the fan-out technique for displaying search results that Google is already using with its AI Mode. The feature itself is powered by Gemini, which helps Google better understand the search query and then link to other pages that could have been missed if using a traditional Google Search.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle suggests the feature works well for open-ended search queries, like \u201chow to solo travel in Japan\u201d or even more complex, multi-sentence queries. For instance, you could ask something like \u201cMy family is spread across multiple time zones. What are the best tools for staying connected and maintaining close relationships despite the distance?\u201d\nEach section of the search results will focus on one type of answer to the query. With the solo travel example, Web Guide would display groupings like those focused on comprehensive guides, safety tips, links where people have shared their personal experiences, and more.\nThe experiment will be available to those who opt in and will initially reconfigure the search results on the Web tab on Search. You can also turn off this Web View from this tab itself, if you want to see the standard results without having to disable the experiment entirely.\nOver time, Google says the experiment will expand to other areas of Search, too, including the \u201cAll\u201d tab.\n\ntitle4:\nChime backer Lauren Kolodny bets on AI to revolutionize estate processing\ndescription4:\nLauren Kolodny, a partner at Acrew Capital, has always championed technology\u2019s power to democratize access to financial services for everyday people.\nWhen the fledgling neobank Chime struggled to convince investors in 2016 that it could build a large business serving the working class, Kolodny was the only VC out of 100 Chime pitched who agreed to back the company, stepping in with a $9 million Series A extension when it was nearly out of money.\nThat bet paid off big time. Last month, Chime went public at a $14.5 billion valuation.\nKolodny, who appeared on the Forbes Midas List three years in a row, is still passionate about investing in tech solutions that help consumers maximize their resources.\nShe recently led a $20 million Series A investment in Alix, a startup that leverages AI to automate the estate settlement process.\nAlix\u2019s founder, Alexandra Mysoor, realized the burden of executing a family estate after she offered to help her best friend settle her late mother\u2019s affairs. Mysoor told TechCrunch that it took her 900 hours and 18 months to complete tasks such as calling the bank to transfer assets, locating all the 401(k)s, canceling accounts, and distributing assets among family members.\n\u201cI was shocked that this process was so hard,\u201d Mysoor said. \u201cIt\u2019s paper-driven. It\u2019s archaic. You\u2019re googling to-do lists that are not helpful. You\u2019re calling attorneys who might do a sliver of the work, and they cost thousands and thousands of dollars.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThat experience gave Mysoor the idea that some of the most labor-intensive aspects of trust administration, including scanning and extracting data from documents, pre-populating complex forms, and communications with banks, can now be handled by AI agents.\nWhen Kolodny met Mysoor and learned about the problem Alix was addressing, the issue resonated so deeply with the Midas List investor that she couldn\u2019t get it out of her mind.\nKolodny realized that even though economists are estimating that trillions of dollars will transfer to millennial and Gen Z generations over the next two decades, the paperwork surrounding estate settlement largely remains a burden on those grieving the loss of their parents.\nWhile some startups like Empathy provide assistance with closing accounts as part of their bereavement support, Kolodny discovered that no companies offered comprehensive, start-to-finish estate settlement services.\n\u201cHow is it possible that there\u2019s this messy problem that involves so much project management that there aren\u2019t even meaningful services around?\u201d Kolodny told TechCrunch. \u201cIt was this real aha moment for me. This is exactly the kind of problem that AI should be solving.\u201d\nKolodny said that she believes Alix is among the first of many startups powered by AI that will democratize financial services and administrative processes, which were historically available only to the ultra-wealthy.\nAlix\u2019s fee structure is 1% of an estate\u2019s value. However, for inheritances under $1 million, customers can expect to pay between $9,000 and $12,000, with the exact cost determined by the complexity of the estate.\"\n\nResponse:",
