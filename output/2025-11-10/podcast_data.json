Osika said the company \u2014 which was founded almost exactly one year ago \u2014 is also seeing \u201c100,000 new products built on Lovable every single day.\u201d\nThe metrics suggest rapid growth of the startup, which has raised $228 million in total funding to date, including a $200 million round this summer that valued the company at $1.8 billion. Rumors have swirled in recent weeks \u2014 potentially sparked by its own investors \u2014 that new backers want to invest at a $5 billion valuation, though Osika said the company isn\u2019t capital constrained and declined to discuss fundraising plans.\nSpeaking to me onstage at the Web Summit event in Lisbon, Osika notably didn\u2019t share another number: Lovable\u2019s current annual recurring revenue. The company, which uses a mix of free and paid tiers, hit $100 million in ARR this June, a milestone it trumpeted publicly. But questions have emerged since about whether the vibe coding boom is sustainable.\nResearch from Barclays this summer, along with Google Trends data, showed that traffic to some of the buzziest services, including Lovable and Vercel\u2019s v0, had declined after peaking earlier this year. (Traffic to Lovable was down 40% as of September, according to the Barclays analysts.) \u201cThis waning traffic begs the question on whether app/site vibecoding has peaked out already or has just had a bit of a lull before interest ramps up,\u201d they reportedly wrote in a note to investors.\nStill, Osika insisted retention remains strong, citing more than 100% net dollar retention \u2014 meaning users spend more over time. He also said the company has \u201cjust passed\u201d the 100-employee mark and is now importing leadership talent from San Francisco to bolster its Stockholm headquarters.\nLovable emerged from GPT Engineer, an open source tool Osika built that went viral among developers. But he says he quickly realized the bigger opportunity lay with the 99% of people who don\u2019t know how to code. \u201cI woke up a few days after building GPT Engineer and I realized, look, we\u2019re going to reimagine how you build software,\u201d Osika said. \u201cI biked to my co-founder\u2019s place, and I said, I have this great idea. I woke him up.\u201d\nThe platform has attracted an eclectic user base. More than half of Fortune 500 companies are using Lovable to \u201csupercharge creativity,\u201d according to Osika. At the same time, he said, an 11-year-old in Lisbon built a Facebook clone for his school, while a Swedish duo is making $700,000 annually from a startup they launched seven months ago on the platform.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cWhat I hear from people trying Lovable is, \u2018It just works,\u2019\u201d Osika said, crediting what he described as Swedish design sensibility.\nSecurity remains a thornier issue for the vibe coding sector. When I raised a recent incident in which an app built with vibe coding tools leaked 72,000 images into the wild, including GPS data and user IDs, Osika acknowledged the problem.\n\u201cThe part of the engineering organization where we\u2019re moving the quickest on hiring is security engineers,\u201d he said, adding that his goal is to make building with Lovable \u201cmore secure than building with just human-written code.\u201d In fact, he said, before users can deploy, Lovable now runs multiple security checks, though the platform still requires users building sensitive applications \u2014 banking apps, for instance \u2014 to hire security experts, just as they would with traditional development.\nOsika was similarly matter-of-fact when I asked about competition from OpenAI and Anthropic, the AI giants whose models power Lovable but that have also released their own coding agents. He sees the market as big enough for multiple winners. \u201cIf we can unlock more human creativity and human agency . . . and just driving the change so that anyone can create if they have good ideas, [and] build businesses on top of that, that should be celebrated, regardless of whoever does that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a decidedly collegial stance in an industry not known for it. (Even Osika has engaged in some light social media sparring with Amjad Masad of competitor Replit.) But he said his focus right now is on building \u201cthe most intuitive experience for humans\u201d rather than obsessing over rivals.\nOsika described Lovable\u2019s mission as building \u201cthe last piece of software\u201d \u2014 a platform where everything a product organization needs, from understanding users to deploying mission-critical features, can be done through a simple interface.\n\u201cDemo, don\u2019t memo,\u201d a popular phrase among product leaders, captures how companies now use Lovable, he said. Employees can now quickly prototype ideas rather than writing long presentations, then test them with early users before committing resources.\nFor all the hypergrowth and investor attention, Osika \u2014 dressed simply in a beige T-shirt and matching button-down, floppy hair framing his face \u2014 appeared very much at ease. The 30-something former particle physicist, who was the first employee at Sauna Labs before founding Lovable, has gone from open source developer to venture-backed founder to must-have conference guest in rapid succession. Yet he seemed more interested in discussing European work culture than dwelling on his company\u2019s trajectory or the attention suddenly being showered on him.\n\u201cWhat I care about is that everyone who\u2019s at the company, they\u2019re mission driven, they really care about what they\u2019re doing and how we as a team succeed,\u201d he said, pushing back against Silicon Valley\u2019s intensifying hustle culture. \u201cThe best people in my team today, most of them, they have kids, and they really, really care about what we\u2019re doing. They\u2019re not working 12 hours, six days a week.\u201d\nThough he added: \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a startup, so they\u2019re probably working more than most jobs.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nKaltura acquires eSelf, founded by creator of Snap\u2019s AI, in $27M deal\ndescription2:\nKaltura, a New York-headquartered AI video platform company, is acquiring eSelf.ai, an Israel-based startup behind conversational avatars \u2014 AI-generated digital humans that can talk with users \u2014 for about $27 million. Kaltura announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire eSelf, a platform supporting more than 30 languages and featuring a user-friendly studio for creating, customizing, and deploying photorealistic digital avatars.\nCo-founded in 2023 by CEO Alan Bekker, who previously sold his first startup, Voca, to Snap in 2020 \u2014 and CTO Eylon Shoshan, eSelf brings deep technical expertise in speech-to-video generation, low-latency speech recognition, and screen understanding, which allows avatars to see and respond to what\u2019s on a user\u2019s screen. The eSelf co-founders will join Kaltura to oversee the integration of eSelf\u2019s technology into the company, with all current eSelf employees coming on board as well.\nThe two-year-old startup has a small but strong team of around 15 AI experts, Ron Yekutiel, co-founder and CEO of Kaltura, told TechCrunch. He noted that Bekker\u2019s former company specialized in natural language processing, which helps computers understand human speech, and computer vision, saying it was a \u201cvery leading company in the area of conversational speech bots. And so he\u2019s an expert [in this field], and that\u2019s what we bought,\u201d Yekutiel said.\nKaltura offers a suite of cloud-based software solutions designed for advanced video applications, including a corporate video portal akin to a private YouTube, tools for webinars and virtual events, and integrations that embed video learning into university learning management systems, or platforms that organize online coursework.\nThe Nasdaq-listed company also delivers virtual classroom products and end-to-end TV streaming solutions. Kaltura\u2019s video platform serves over 800 enterprise customers, helping them engage users across sales, marketing, customer care, education, and entertainment. Its clients include tech giants like Amazon, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and IBM, as well as leading banks, insurance companies, consulting firms, pharmaceutical companies, and universities in the U.S.\nKaltura plans to integrate eSelf.ai\u2019s virtual agent technology across its video offerings; the integration aims to enable agents that can listen, speak, and interpret user screens in real time.\n\u201cThis acquisition was so strategic. We were actively evaluating multiple companies to find the right fit. We determined that they [eSelf] were best-in-class for real-time, synchronous conversation \u2014 not just video-on-demand lip-syncing \u2014 and that they had an impressive speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology stack,\u201d Yekutiel said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cBeyond the technology, there was also a strong cultural and geographic alignment, which was critical for us.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nWhy a video company is betting on conversational avatars\nFor the past two decades, businesses have mostly used video for streaming, uploading, and managing content. But that\u2019s changing fast. Thanks to AI, videos can now be generated instantly \u2014 hyper-personalized and contextual \u2014 giving every viewer their own custom experience, tailored exactly to what they need in that moment, Yekutiel explained.\n\u201cWe started with video, then moved to personalized video, and now, with eSelf\u2019s technology, we\u2019re adding human-like capabilities \u2014 faces, eyes, mouths, ears \u2014 to make our AI agents conversational and expressive,\u201d Yekutiel said.\nKaltura is evolving from a video platform into a video-based customer and employee experience provider, where video serves as the interface. Unlike most avatar companies that offer only a \u201cface,\u201d it delivers the full workflow \u2014 avatar, intelligence, and enterprise-connected knowledge. The focus isn\u2019t just streaming video; it\u2019s driving measurable business results and ROI, the CEO added.\nThe company plans to launch standalone, embeddable agents for uses including sales, marketing, customer support, and training. Target sectors include education, media and telecom, e-commerce, financial services, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals.\nAsked about media reports saying Kaltura was exploring a sale or merger at a $400 million to $500 million valuation, Yekutiel told TechCrunch that Kaltura has explored opportunities with a range of companies, including potential \u201cacquisitions, mergers with similarly sized firms, and connections with some larger players.\u201d But it never got close to a transaction like the ones being reported, he said. He also pointed to Kaltura\u2019s recent acquisitions, including its fourth company, as evidence of the company\u2019s continued commitment to its current strategy.\nThis marks Kaltura\u2019s fourth acquisition to date. The company acquired cloud TV solution Tvinci in 2014, followed by Rapt Media in 2018, and video conferencing platform Newrow in 2020. eSelf\u2019s most recent funding round was its $4.5 million announced in December 2024.\nKaltura, which went public in 2021, reports around $180 million in revenue, is profitable on an adjusted EBITDA and cash flow basis, and has about 600 employees.\n\ntitle3:\nWikipedia urges AI companies to use its paid API, and stop scraping\ndescription3:\nWikipedia on Monday laid out a simple plan to ensure its website continues to be supported in the AI era, despite its declining traffic.\nIn a blog post, the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization that runs the popular online encyclopedia, called on AI developers to use its content \u201cresponsibly\u201d by ensuring its contributions are properly attributed and that content is accessed through its paid product, the Wikimedia Enterprise platform.\nThe opt-in, paid product allows companies to use Wikipedia\u2019s content at scale without \u201cseverely taxing Wikipedia\u2019s servers,\u201d the Wikimedia Foundation blog post explains. In addition, the product\u2019s paid nature allows AI companies to support the organization\u2019s nonprofit mission.\nWhile the post doesn\u2019t go so far as to threaten penalties or any sort of legal action for use of its material through scraping, Wikipedia recently noted that AI bots had been scraping its website while trying to appear human. After updating its bot-detection systems, the organization found that its unusually high traffic in May and June had come from AI bots that were trying to \u201cevade detection.\u201d Meanwhile, it said that \u201chuman page views\u201d had declined 8% year-over-year.\nNow Wikipedia is laying out its guidelines for AI developers and providers, saying that generative AI developers should provide attribution to give credit to the human contributors whose content it uses to create its outputs.\n\u201cFor people to trust information shared on the internet, platforms should make it clear where the information is sourced from and elevate opportunities to visit and participate in those sources,\u201d the post reads. \u201cWith fewer visits to Wikipedia, fewer volunteers may grow and enrich the content, and fewer individual donors may support this work.\u201d\nEarlier this year, the organization released its AI strategy for editors, which said it would use AI to help editors with workflows around tedious tasks, automating translation, and other tools that help its editors, not replace them.\n\ntitle4:\nRad Power Bikes faces shutdown in January without new funding\ndescription4:\nRad Power Bikes has informed its employees that it will shut down in January if it is unable to find new funding or get acquired, according to an internal staff email viewed by TechCrunch.\nThe company\u2019s leadership is \u201cstill fighting to find ways to continue,\u201d and \u201cthe cessation of Rad\u2019s operations is not a forgone conclusion,\u201d according to the email, which was sent by Rad Power\u2019s \u201cpeople team.\u201d Rad Power employees were told there had been a \u201cvery promising\u201d option to keep the company alive that \u201cappeared to be likely to close,\u201d but the deal \u2014 which was not specified in the email \u2014 \u201cdid not come to fruition.\u201d\n\u201cRad is nothing without its people and wants to ensure that all employees are taken care of and provided for to the fullest extent feasible. Executive leaders are hopeful that a viable solution will be found to ensure that Rad team members remain gainfully employed for the foreseeable future. However, to be fully transparent, despite our collective efforts, it is possible that this may not happen, and Rad may be forced to cease operations,\u201d the email reads. GeekWire was first to report the contents of the email.\nSeattle-based Rad Power has gone through multiple rounds of layoffs over the last few years coming out of the pandemic. While the early pandemic days were a boon to micromobility companies like Rad Power, a \u201csudden drop in consumer demand\u201d left the company saddled with excess inventory, according to the email viewed by TechCrunch. \u201cRad continues to face significant financial challenges, including in the form of tariffs and the macroeconomic landscape.\u201d\n\u201cAt this time, Rad\u2019s leadership is focused on supporting our employees, serving our Rad Riders, and giving Rad the best chance for longevity,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said.\nRad Power is far from the only company in the e-bike or micromobility space to run into trouble recently. A number of others have gone out of business or had to restructure over the last few years, like Cake, VanMoof, Superpedestrian, and Bird.\nDespite the industry turmoil, Rad Power was still considered to make some of the most compelling e-bikes on the market. But faced with escalating financial pressure, the company swapped CEOs earlier this year. It brought in an executive named Kathi Lentzsch who has spent decades turning around underperforming companies.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

But this isn\u2019t a targeted layoff, according to the email \u2014 it\u2019s just the only Rad Power office with enough workers to necessitate this kind of mandated warning.\n\u201cIn the event the company is forced to close, Rad would be required to cease operations on January 9, 2026, or within 14 days thereafter,\u201d according to the email. \u201cIn that case, Rad expects that any cessation of operations will affect all locations and departments, will be permanent in nature, and that all employees will be terminated effective January 9, 2026.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
