Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Ricci is the former chairman and CEO of Nuance.\nThe press release states that Russell resigned as president and CEO and as the chairperson of the board, effective immediately. The board said in the press release the resignation followed a code of business conduct and ethics inquiry for the audit committee of Luminar\u2019s board. Russell will remain on the board and be \u201cavailable to the incoming Chief Executive Officer on transition and technology matters,\u201d according to the release.\nA day after the leadership change was announced, board member Jun Hong Heng also resigned, according to a regulatory filing, which stated his decision was not due to any disagreements with the company on any matter relating to the company\u2019s operations, policies, or practices.\nIt\u2019s not clear if Russell was forced out or if he resigned willingly. Russell could not be reached for comment. Heng could not be reached for comment. The board did not provide further details of this ethics inquiry except that it \u201cdoes not impact any of the company\u2019s financial results.\u201d\nIn a further twist, the company\u2019s earnings report and slide presentation makes no mention of the change of leadership. The first-quarter press release even includes an upbeat statement from Russell that outlines the company\u2019s strategy to drive down cost with its new Halo product.\n\u201cIn a world of macro uncertainty and adversity, we\u2019re firing on all cylinders to ramp up production, ramp down costs, and capitalize on the future, as evidenced by our announcements today,\u201d Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis kicks off our new operating plan for Luminar with a unified product platform, enabling radical focus and streamlining of the business, as well as unlocking value throughout our organization.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nMeanwhile, the press release from the board tells another story.\n\u201cWe are excited to announce Paul as our next CEO,\u201d board member Matt Simoncini said in a statement. \u201cHis track record speaks for itself. He is a visionary leader with a rare combination of technical insight and operational excellence. His commitment to innovation, his ability to scale organizations, and his instinct for anticipating where technology is heading make him the ideal person to lead us into our next chapter of growth. The Board has full confidence in his leadership, and we are excited about what lies ahead.\u201d\nSimoncini, who retired as CEO of Lear in 2018, is chair of the board\u2019s audit committee, which also includes Jun Hong Heng, who is the founder and chief investment officer of technology investment firm Crescent Cove Advisors, Evergreen Capital Partners founder Dominick Schiano, and Daniel Tempesta, who served as executive VP and CFO at Nuance.\nLuminar burst onto the autonomous vehicle scene in April 2017 after operating for years in secrecy. Russell, who was just 22 years old at the time, was thrust into the spotlight and became a Silicon Valley success story. Luminar was founded by Russell in 2012, but it would be years before his company would be known by the public. He worked on the Luminar technology as a Thiel fellow, which gives young people $100,000 over two years to drop out of college and pursue their ideas.\nIn 2021, Luminar merged with special purpose acquisition company Gores Metropoulos Inc., with a post-deal market valuation of $3.4 billion. Luminar raised $250 million prior to the SPAC announcement.\nThis article originally published May 14. It has been updated to include information about a board member resigning.\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo gets OK to expand robotaxi service into more of Silicon Valley\ndescription1:\nThe California Public Utilities Commission has approved Waymo\u2019s request to expand its commercial robotaxi service area, opening the door for the Alphabet company to bring its driverless ride-hailing vehicles into more communities south of San Francisco.\nThe company said in a post on X the approval won\u2019t change its plans in the near term. Today, Waymo operates a commercial robotaxi service in all of San Francisco as well as parts of the Peninsula. It also provides driverless rides to paying customers throughout several Silicon Valley cities, including parts of Mountain View, Palo Alto, Los Altos, and Sunnyvale. In all, the company\u2019s service area is about 85 square miles covering San Francisco and Silicon Valley.\nWe\u2019re very excited to share that the CPUC has approved our application to operate our fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing service in the South Bay and nearly all of San Jose!\nWhile this won\u2019t change our operations in the near-term, we\u2019re looking forward to bringing the\u2026 \u2014 Waymo (@Waymo) May 19, 2025\nThe company is also aiming to unlock access to the San Francisco International Airport, although those plans are on a much longer timeline. Waymo was given permission in March to map roadways at SFO via a temporary permit. Waymo vehicles will not operate autonomously in the airport; employees will manually drive the vehicles to map the area. But the permit signals the beginning of a phased approach to Waymo eventually operating commercially there.\nWaymo provides 250,000 paid trips each week across its operations, which extends to Los Angeles, Phoenix, and more recently Austin.\n\ntitle2:\nJudge pressures Apple to approve Fortnite or return to court\ndescription2:\nA federal judge is asking Apple to approve Fortnite\u2019s submission on the U.S. App Store or return to court to explain the legal basis as to why it has not done so.\nIn a new filing, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers confirms the court has received Epic Games\u2019 latest motion, where it demands that Apple approve Fortnite for distribution on the App Store.\nThe clearly annoyed judge asks Apple to show the court the \u201clegal authority upon which Apple contends that it can ignore this Court\u2019s order.\u201d Gonzalez Rogers also suggests that Apple will need to return to court to explain if the situation is not addressed.\n\u201cApple is fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers reminds the tech giant, before adding that Apple name the company official who\u2019s responsible for ensuring compliance with the court\u2019s decision.\nReading between the lines, the demand for the name of the Apple official in the new filing suggests that Gonzalez Rogers is not above considering contempt charges for failing to comply with the court\u2019s injunction.\nThis follows her earlier ruling, where the judge skewered Apple for attempting to route around the court\u2019s orders and accused the tech company of lying under oath.\nAfter winning the right to include links to external payment mechanisms in its app, Epic Games resubmitted Fortnite to the U.S. App Store. However, Apple told the game maker that it decided not to take action on Epic Games\u2019 submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on Apple\u2019s pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction. (In other words, Apple said it didn\u2019t have to approve the app until the legal proceedings around its appeal fully played out.)\nEpic Games on Friday filed a motion to compel the court to enforce the injunction, given Apple\u2019s decision.\nThe latest legal threat follows a years-long court battle over Apple\u2019s App Store policies, which had long denied app developers the right to link to external payment options without paying Apple a commission. Apple originally complied with the court\u2019s decision in the lawsuit by allowing U.S. developers to apply for an exception to its App Store rules, but it still collected a 27% commission on those alternative purchases, down from the usual 30%. Apple also required developers to use \u201cscare screens\u201d that warned consumers when they were clicking through to make a purchase outside its App Store.\nIn a major victory for developers, Gonzalez Rogers ruled Apple was in \u201cwillful violation\u201d of the court\u2019s injunction on anticompetitive pricing and commissions, which would have seemingly allowed Fortnite to return to the App Store. But Apple sat on the submission for a week instead, neither approving nor denying the game\u2019s publication, while its lawyers crafted a response.\nWhat happens next could be significant for Apple, as it may inspire similar legal action or regulation in other global markets.\nApple was the victor in Epic\u2019s original antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant, as the court declared it was not a monopolist. However, Epic Games carved out a win in one area when Gonzalez Rogers agreed that iPhone users should have access to alternative payment options if a developer wanted to use its own website for in-app purchases, like those for virtual goods or subscriptions.\nFollowing the decision, Apple updated its App Store policies for the U.S., and apps, including Spotify, Amazon Kindle, and Patreon quickly rolled out new versions of their apps to take advantage of the new functionality.\nEpic Games declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle3:\nKlarna\u2019s revenue per employee soars to nearly $1M thanks to AI efficiency push\ndescription3:\nLast year, Klarna announced a significant initiative to leverage its internally developed AI systems, powered by OpenAI, across its operations.\nThis wasn\u2019t empty talk for the buy now, pay later giant. The company not only ended its pricey contract with Salesforce CRM, but also curtailed its hiring efforts, allowing AI to do some of the work previously performed by humans.\nKlarna announced Monday its reliance on AI is driving significant efficiency for the company, and it\u2019s on track to reach $1 million in revenue per employee, up from $575,000 per worker a year prior, according to the company\u2019s latest financials. While the company claims most functions became more efficient thanks to its AI efforts, the largest financial impact was the significant reduction in customer service costs.\nKlarna said last year it planned to replace nearly 700 full-time customer service contractors with AI chatbots. However, last week, the company said customers would again have the option to speak with a human agent.\nIn March, the Swedish company filed paperwork for its highly anticipated U.S. IPO. Klarna postponed those plans last month due to the volatility in the stock market triggered by President Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.\nDespite a 13% revenue increase to $701 million in Q1 2025, the company provided no timeline for resuming its IPO plans.\n\ntitle4:\nWaymo and Uber are giving some riders early access to Atlanta robotaxi service\ndescription4:\nWaymo and Uber will start offering robotaxi rides in Atlanta to select customers who earlier this year signed onto a waitlist. The move comes ahead of the companies\u2019 public robotaxi launch this summer.\nCustomers selected for early access will be notified in the Uber app and via email. Those who opt for the robotaxi rides will be encouraged to provide feedback during and after the ride. As an extra incentive, riders will receive $10 worth of Uber credits after their first Waymo ride.\nAtlanta is the second city to get the \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d service. The companies launched the service, which matches riders with a Waymo via the Uber app, in Austin this spring.\nUber and Waymo last September announced plans to offer a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta in early 2025 as part of an expanded partnership. Under the partnership, only Uber users can hail Waymo\u2019s fleet of autonomous Jaguar I-PACE vehicles.\nLike every other city that Waymo has launched in \u2014 a list that includes Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco \u2014 the service area in Atlanta will grow over time. Waymo and Uber have agreed to initially offer robotaxi rides in a 65-square-mile area in Atlanta, including downtown, Buckhead, and Capitol View neighborhoods.\nThe \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d service splits the responsibilities of owning and operating a fleet of driverless vehicles: Uber handles the charging, maintenance, and cleaning of the autonomous vehicles, as well as managing access to the robotaxis via its app, while Waymo monitors the tech and the autonomous operations, including rider assistance.\"\n\nResponse:",
