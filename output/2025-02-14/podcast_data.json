Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Figure\u2019s current round is expected to be led by Align Ventures and Parkway Venture Capital, Bloomberg reported.\nFigure builds humanoid robots for commercial and residential purposes. Humanoid robots are all the rage thanks to the AI boom: Austin-based Apptronik just raised $350 million while Meta is reportedly looking to get into robotics, too.\nFigure has already sold some robots to BMW. Its founder Brett Adcock posted last month that Figure has signed on a second (unnamed) commercial customer and sees the potential to ship 100,000 humanoid robots.\nFigure declined to comment.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI says its board of directors 'unanimously' rejects Elon Musk's bid\ndescription1:\nOpenAI\u2019s board of directors has \u201cunanimously\u201d rejected billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s offer to buy the nonprofit that effectively governs OpenAI, the company said on Friday.\nIn a statement shared via OpenAI\u2019s press account on X, Bret Taylor, board chair, called Musk\u2019s bid \u201can attempt to disrupt his competition.\u201d\n\u201cOpenAI is not for sale, and the board has unanimously rejected Mr. Musk\u2019s latest attempt to disrupt his competition,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAny potential reorganization of OpenAI will strengthen our nonprofit and its mission to ensure [artificial general intelligence] benefits all of humanity.\u201d\nThe New York Times reported that OpenAI also sent a letter to Musk\u2019s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, saying that the bid was \u201cnot in the best interests of [OpenAI\u2019s] mission.\u201d\nOn Monday, Musk, his AI company, xAI, and a group of investors offered to buy OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit for $97.4 billion. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the company\u2019s board of directors quickly \u2014 but not formally \u2014 dismissed the unsolicited proposal. In a statement, Andy Nussbaum, the counsel representing OpenAI\u2019s board, said Musk\u2019s bid \u201cdoesn\u2019t set a value for [OpenAI\u2019s] nonprofit\u201d and that the nonprofit is \u201cnot for sale.\u201d\nMusk, an OpenAI co-founder, last year brought a lawsuit against the company and Altman that alleges that OpenAI engaged in anticompetitive behavior and fraud, among other offenses.\nOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit before it transitioned to a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d structure in 2019. The nonprofit is the sole controlling shareholder of the capped-profit OpenAI corporation, which retains formal fiduciary responsibility to the nonprofit\u2019s charter. OpenAI is now in the process of restructuring \u2014 this time to a traditional for-profit company, specifically a public benefit corporation. But Musk, via the lawsuit, is seeking to enjoin the conversion.\nIn a court filing on Wednesday, lawyers for Musk said the billionaire will withdraw his bid if OpenAI\u2019s board \u201cpreserve[s] the charity\u2019s mission\u201d and halts OpenAI\u2019s conversion to a for-profit. In a filing earlier the same day, attorneys for OpenAI called Musk\u2019s move to take control of the company \u201can improper bid to undermine a competitor,\u201d and a contradiction of his position in court that a transfer of the startup\u2019s assets through restructuring would breach its mission as a charitable trust.\nMusk\u2019s allies and Altman have traded blows over the bid this week. In a podcast interview on Thursday, Ari Emanuel, one of the backers of Musk\u2019s offer for the OpenAI nonprofit, called Altman a \u201cphony\u201d who is \u201ctrying to get away with cheating the charity and its original mission.\u201d Altman has characterized Musk\u2019s bid as \u201can attempt to slow [OpenAI] down,\u201d and quipped that Musk\u2019s life is \u201cfrom a position of insecurity.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nUber sues DoorDash, alleging anti-competitive tactics\ndescription2:\nRide-share giant Uber filed a lawsuit Friday against DoorDash, accusing the delivery outfit of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals.\nUber alleges in the lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of California, that its chief rival bullied restaurants into only working with DoorDash. Uber claims that DoorDash, which holds the largest share of the food delivery market in the U.S., threatens restaurants with multimillion-dollar penalties or the removal or demotion of the businesses\u2019 position on the DoorDash app.\nSpecifically, Uber claims DoorDash pressures restaurants to strike exclusive or near-exclusive agreements for first-party delivery services, meaning that DoorDash insists on solely handling orders placed through restaurants\u2019 own websites, says Uber.\n\u201cUber\u2019s case has no merit,\u201d said a DoorDash spokesperson in an email to TechCrunch on Friday. \u201cTheir claims are unfounded and based on their inability to offer merchants, consumers, or couriers a quality alternative.\u201d\nDoorDash and Uber Eats are best known for their respective apps to connect restaurant, consumers and gig economy workers. Consumers use the apps to find and order food like pizza, egg rolls, or pad thai from restaurants. A gig economy worker then picks up and delivers the food to the consumer.\nBut the two companies also compete with their own white-label delivery services \u2013 called Uber Direct and DoorDash Drive on-Demand \u2013 which both launched in 2020. These services are cheaper for restaurants, allowing patrons to order directly from the restaurants\u2019 own apps and websites, while Uber and DoorDash manage the couriers behind the scenes.\nUber claims in its suit that DoorDash handles first-party deliveries for more than 90% of the largest enterprise restaurants in America, and it alleges DoorDash used anticompetitive practices to win the market.\n\u201cMore than 1 million merchants partner with Uber Eats because we\u2019ve helped them to reach more customers and provided them the freedom to decide how they want to grow their businesses with delivery,\u201d Sarfraz Maredia, head of the Americas for delivery at Uber, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly heard complaints from restaurants that DoorDash\u2019s tactics are limiting that freedom and punishing them for seeking better options. We hope this filing puts an end to those unfair practices so that restaurants can choose what\u2019s best for them without fear of penalty or retribution.\u201d\nIn one example from the lawsuit, Uber says that an unnamed \u201csignificant restaurant company\u201d told the company it would not move forward with a long-planned rollout of Uber Direct across several of its restaurant brands. The reason, Uber claims, is because DoorDash allegedly threatened to increase the rates it charges the restaurant company to use DoorDash\u2019s third-party delivery services if it continued to use Uber Direct.\nUber says this was not a one-off event, but rather that multiple customer have told the company they feel \u201clike they have a \u2018gun to their head,\u2019 that DoorDash is a \u2018monopolist,\u2019 and that they are being bullied by DoorDash.\u201d\nUber has requested a jury trial; the company did not specify the amount of damages in the complaint. However, Uber claims these anticompetitive practices have cost the company \u201cmillions of dollars in revenue\u201d and also restricted the growth of Uber Direct.\n\ntitle3:\nCourt filings show Meta paused efforts to license books for AI training\ndescription3:\nNew court filings in an AI copyright case against Meta add credence to earlier reports that the company \u201cpaused\u201d discussions with book publishers on licensing deals to supply some of its generative AI models with training data.\nThe filings are related to the case Kadrey v. Meta Platforms \u2014 one of many such cases winding through the U.S. court system that\u2019s pitted AI companies against authors and other intellectual property holders. For the most part, the defendants in these cases \u2014 AI companies \u2014 have claimed that training on copyrighted content is \u201cfair use.\u201d The plaintiffs \u2014 copyright holders \u2014 have vociferously disagreed.\nThe new filings submitted to the court Friday, which include partial transcripts of Meta employee depositions taken by attorneys for plaintiffs in the case, suggest that certain Meta staff felt negotiating AI training data licenses for books might not be scalable.\nAccording to one transcript, Sy Choudhury, who leads Meta\u2019s AI partnership initiatives, said that Meta\u2019s outreach to various publishers was met with \u201cvery slow uptake in engagement and interest.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall the entire list, but I remember we had made a long list from initially scouring the Internet of top publishers, et cetera,\u201d Choudhury said, per the transcript, \u201cand we didn\u2019t get contact and feedback from \u2014 from a lot of our cold call outreaches to try to establish contact.\u201d\nChoudhury added, \u201cThere were a few, like, that did, you know, engage, but not many.\u201d\nAccording to the court transcripts, Meta paused certain AI-related book licensing efforts in early April 2023 after encountering \u201ctiming\u201d and other logistical setbacks. Choudhury said some publishers, in particular fiction book publishers, turned out to not in fact have the rights to the content that Meta was considering licensing, per a transcript.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to point out that the \u2014 in the fiction category, we quickly learned from the business development team that most of the publishers we were talking to, they themselves were representing that they did not have, actually, the rights to license the data to us,\u201d Choudhury said. \u201cAnd so it would take a long time to engage with all their authors.\u201d\nChoudhury noted during his deposition that Meta has on at least one other occasion paused licensing efforts related to AI development, according to a transcript.\n\u201cI am aware of licensing efforts such, for example, we tried to license 3D worlds from different game engine and game manufacturers for our AI research team,\u201d Choudhury said. \u201cAnd in the same way that I\u2019m describing here for fiction and textbook data, we got very little engagement to even have a conversation [\u2026] We decided to \u2014 in that case, we decided to build our own solution.\u201d\nCounsel for the plaintiffs, who include bestselling authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, have amended their complaint several times since the case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division in 2023. The latest amended complaint submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel alleges that Meta, among other offenses, cross-referenced certain pirated books with copyrighted books available for license to determine whether it made sense to pursue a licensing agreement with a publisher.\nThe complaint also accuses Meta of using \u201cshadow libraries\u201d containing pirated e-books to train several of the company\u2019s AI models, including its popular Llama series of \u201copen\u201d models. According to the complaint, Meta may have secured some of the libraries via torrenting. Torrenting, a way of distributing files across the web, requires that torrenters simultaneously \u201cseed,\u201d or upload, the files they\u2019re trying to obtain \u2014 which the plaintiffs asserted is a form of copyright infringement.\n\ntitle4:\nAI Alexa and AI Siri face bugs and delays\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAmazon and Apple are struggling to put generative AI technology in their digital assistants \u2014 Alexa and Siri, respectively \u2014 according to a pair of reports that came out on Friday.\nAmazon hoped to release its new Alexa during an event in New York on February 26. Now Amazon plans to delay the release of its generative AI-powered Alexa until March or later, according to the Washington Post.\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reports that Apple\u2019s AI overhaul of Siri is running into engineering problems and software bugs. Some new features around Siri that were planned for release in April may not be ready until May or later.\nAmazon and Apple hoped to release these updated products quickly to compete with next-gen AI voice assistants, such as OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode and Google\u2019s Gemini Live. However, those efforts are not going according to plan.\"\n\nResponse:",
