    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday March 28), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpen source devs are fighting AI crawlers with cleverness and vengeance\ndescription0:\nAI web-crawling bots are the cockroaches of the internet, many software developers believe. Some devs have started fighting back in ingenuous, often humorous ways.\nWhile any website might be targeted by bad crawler behavior \u2014 sometimes taking down the site \u2014 open source developers are \u201cdisproportionately\u201d impacted, writes Niccol\u00f2 Venerandi, developer of a Linux desktop known as Plasma and owner of the blog LibreNews.\nBy their nature, sites hosting free and open source (FOSS) projects share more of their infrastructure publicly, and they also tend to have fewer resources than commercial products.\nThe issue is that many AI bots don\u2019t honor the Robots Exclusion Protocol robot.txt file, the tool that tells bots what not to crawl, originally created for search engine bots.\nIn a \u201ccry for help\u201d blog post in January, FOSS developer Xe Iaso described how AmazonBot relentlessly pounded on a Git server website to the point of causing DDoS outages. Git servers host FOSS projects so that anyone who wants can download the code or contribute to it.\nBut this bot ignored Iaso\u2019s robot.txt, hid behind other IP addresses, and pretended to be other users, Iaso said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s futile to block AI crawler bots because they lie, change their user agent, use residential IP addresses as proxies, and more,\u201d Iaso lamented.\n\u201cThey will scrape your site until it falls over, and then they will scrape it some more. They will click every link on every link on every link, viewing the same pages over and over and over and over. Some of them will even click on the same link multiple times in the same second,\u201d the developer wrote in the post.\nEnter the god of graves\nSo Iaso fought back with cleverness, building a tool called Anubis.\nAnubis is a reverse proxy proof-of-work check that must be passed before requests are allowed to hit a Git server. It blocks bots but lets through browsers operated by humans.\nThe funny part: Anubis is the name of a god in Egyptian mythology who leads the dead to judgment.\n\u201cAnubis weighed your soul (heart) and if it was heavier than a feather, your heart got eaten and you, like, mega died,\u201d Iaso told TechCrunch. If a web request passes the challenge and is determined to be human, a cute anime picture announces success. The drawing is \u201cmy take on anthropomorphizing Anubis,\u201d says Iaso. If it\u2019s a bot, the request gets denied.\nThe wryly named project has spread like the wind among the FOSS community. Iaso shared it on GitHub on March 19, and in just a few days, it collected 2,000 stars, 20 contributors, and 39 forks.\nVengeance as defense\nThe instant popularity of Anubis shows that Iaso\u2019s pain is not unique. In fact, Venerandi shared story after story:\nFounder CEO of SourceHut Drew DeVault described spending \u201cfrom 20-100% of my time in any given week mitigating hyper-aggressive LLM crawlers at scale,\u201d and \u201cexperiencing dozens of brief outages per week.\u201d\nJonathan Corbet, a famed FOSS developer who runs Linux industry news site LWN, warned that his site was being slowed by DDoS-level traffic \u201cfrom AI scraper bots.\u201d\nKevin Fenzi, the sysadmin of the enormous Linux Fedora project, said the AI scraper bots had gotten so aggressive, he had to block the entire country of Brazil from access.\nVenerandi tells TechCrunch that he knows of multiple other projects experiencing the same issues. One of them \u201chad to temporarily ban all Chinese IP addresses at one point.\u201d\nLet that sink in for a moment \u2014 that developers \u201ceven have to turn to banning entire countries\u201d just to fend off AI bots that ignore robot.txt files, says Venerandi.\nBeyond weighing the soul of a web requester, other devs believe vengeance is the best defense.\nA few days ago on Hacker News, user xyzal suggested loading robot.txt forbidden pages with \u201ca bucket load of articles on the benefits of drinking bleach\u201d or \u201carticles about positive effect of catching measles on performance in bed.\u201d\n\u201cThink we need to aim for the bots to get _negative_ utility value from visiting our traps, not just zero value,\u201d xyzal explained.\nAs it happens, in January, an anonymous creator known as \u201cAaron\u201d released a tool called Nepenthes that aims to do exactly that. It traps crawlers in an endless maze of fake content, a goal that the dev admitted to Ars Technica is aggressive if not downright malicious. The tool is named after a carnivorous plant.\nAnd Cloudflare, perhaps the biggest commercial player offering several tools to fend off AI crawlers, last week released a similar tool called AI Labyrinth.\nIt\u2019s intended to \u201cslow down, confuse, and waste the resources of AI Crawlers and other bots that don\u2019t respect \u2018no crawl\u2019 directives,\u201d Cloudflare described in its blog post. Cloudflare said it feeds misbehaving AI crawlers \u201cirrelevant content rather than extracting your legitimate website data.\u201d\nSourceHut\u2019s DeVault told TechCrunch that \u201cNepenthes has a satisfying sense of justice to it, since it feeds nonsense to the crawlers and poisons their wells, but ultimately Anubis is the solution that worked\u201d for his site.\nBut DeVault also issued a public, heartfelt plea for a more direct fix: \u201cPlease stop legitimizing LLMs or AI image generators or GitHub Copilot or any of this garbage. I am begging you to stop using them, stop talking about them, stop making new ones, just stop.\u201d\nSince the likelihood of that is zilch, developers, particularly in FOSS, are fighting back with cleverness and a touch of humor.\n\ntitle1:\nTikTok to launch TikTok Shop in France, Germany, and Italy\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nTikTok is set to expand its TikTok Shop e-commerce platform to users in France, Germany, and Italy on Monday, Reuters reports. TikTok Shop has been available in the United Kingdom since 2021, and now the company is ready to expand farther into Europe.\nWhile TikTok Shop is also available in the United States and saw strong sales over the holiday season, TikTok\u2019s fate in the country remains uncertain.\nReuters states that TikTok has been looking to onboard more Europe-based sellers onto TikTok Shop, as many sellers on the platform sell products directly from China.\n\u201cIn France, Germany, and Italy, we are already working with merchants to get their products listed on the platform, and TikTok Shop will be available to our TikTok users from next Monday,\u201d Jan Wilk, head of operations at TikTok Shop UK, told Reuters.\nWilk says TikTok is seeking to broaden its product offerings and prices on TikTok Shop, which is mostly known for discounted prices. For example, Wilk noted that there is a U.K.-based luxury goods store on TikTok Shop that sells secondhand Birkin bags.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle rolls out new vacation-planning features to Search, Maps, and Gemini\ndescription2:\nGoogle is rolling out a slew of new features \u2014 some powered by AI \u2014 across Search, Maps, and Gemini that are designed to help people plan their summer vacations. The new features arrive as users have been turning to tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT for help with planning trips.\nGoogle Search\u2019s AI Overviews, which display a snapshot of information at the top of the results page, can now help users get trip ideas for certain regions or countries. Starting this week, users can search for something like \u201ccreate an itinerary for Costa Rica with a focus on nature.\u201d\nFrom there, you will be able to browse through photos and reviews and see locations on an expandable map. When you\u2019re ready to save an itinerary, you can tap \u201cExport\u201d to share the recommendations through Docs or Gmail. Or, you can save them as a custom list in Google Maps.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe new feature is available for English language queries in the U.S. on mobile and desktop.\nGoogle is also making Gemini\u2019s Gems feature available to everyone for free. A Gem is a tool that lets you create custom AI experts for any task within Gemini. This means that users can now set up a trip planner that can help them pick a destination to go to and suggest what to pack.\nIn addition, while Google has allowed users to get alerts on price drops for flights for quite some time now, it\u2019s now going to do the same with hotels. Users will now see a new option to track hotel prices for chosen dates and destinations. You can select filters for your hotel search, such as star ratings or beach access, for a specific area. If prices go down, Google will send you an email.\nHotel price tracking is launching globally this week on mobile and desktop browsers.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for Maps, Google is rolling out the ability for users to turn their screenshots into solid vacation plans. When planning a vacation, people often take screenshots to bookmark places they want to visit, but can sometimes forget about these photos in their camera roll.\nNow, users can give Maps access to their photos to allow the app to automatically identify places mentioned in your screenshots so you can review and save the ones you want to a list. The places that you save will show up on the map so you can get an overview of your plans.\nThis feature is rolling out this week in the U.S. in English on iOS, and will launch on Android soon.\n\ntitle3:\nSignal downloads spike in the US and Yemen amid government scandal\ndescription3:\nThe encrypted messaging app Signal is getting some unexpected attention this week.\nHigh-ranking officials in the Trump administration, including Vice President J. D. Vance and Secretary of Defense Peter Hegseth, communicated the plans for an attack on the Yemeni Houthis via a potentially unauthorized group chat on Signal. However, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added to the group chat, giving him access to these highly sensitive discussions, which he later published.\nThe Signal app itself did not malfunction or operate in an unintended way. Rather, it is user error to accidentally add a journalist to a chat about U.S. military plans \u2014 an error that government security protocols should be able to prevent if they\u2019re actually followed.\nWhen the Atlantic\u2019s story broke on Monday, worldwide Signal downloads on iOS and Google Play were up 28% from the daily average over the last 30 days, per app intelligence firm Appfigures. In the U.S., downloads were up 45% on Monday, and in Yemen, they were up by 42%. Before the scandal, Signal was ranked No. 50 among social media apps in Yemen, but it climbed to No. 9 on Monday.\nSignal did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nAll communications on Signal are encrypted, meaning that only the people in a chat can see the texts \u2014 not even people who work at Signal can know what users are talking about. But Signal is intended to be a consumer product for secure messaging, not an iron-clad depository for government military plans.\nAlthough Hegseth said that there were \u201cno war plans\u201d discussed in the Signal chat, the Atlantic published messages that show Hegseth providing details about the timing of attacks, as well as the weapons and aircrafts that would be used.\nAs of Thursday, the government continues to investigate this monumental security failure.\n\ntitle4:\nInstagram now lets you speed up reels just like on TikTok\ndescription4:\nMeta-owned Instagram is copying yet another feature from TikTok. This time, it\u2019s the ability for users to play a reel at 2x speed by long pressing on the right or left side of their screen.\nWhen TikTok first launched, videos could only be 15 seconds long. As the years passed and TikTok rose in popularity, the social network rolled out support for longer videos. With this, TikTok introduced the option for users to speed up videos, as they had been trained to consume content more quickly.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nInstagram Reels also started off by allowing users to post videos that were only up to 15 seconds in length. Today, users can share videos that are up to 3 minutes long. Like TikTok, Instagram wants to give users the option to watch more content quickly with the new fast-forward option.\nThe ability to fast-forward a video increases the chances of a viewer actually reaching the end of longer videos, especially since the idea behind Reels is to offer users quick, bite-sized pieces of entertainment. This can be attributed to concerns that the rise of short-form video content may be negatively impacting our attention spans and ability to focus on longer-form content.\nGiven that Instagram Reels is a direct clone of TikTok, it\u2019s not surprising that the platform is borrowing specific features from the short-form video platform. It\u2019s not the first time Instagram has done so either, as its Remix feature is a copy of TikTok\u2019s Duet tool.\"\n\nResponse:",
