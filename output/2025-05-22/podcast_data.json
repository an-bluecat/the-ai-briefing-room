Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

OpenAI expects 200MW will go live in 2026, developed with partners including G42, Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco, and SoftBank.\nIn a blog post, OpenAI claims that Stargate UAE has the potential to provide AI infrastructure and compute capacity within a 2,000-mile radius.\n\u201cThis is [\u2026] the first partnership under OpenAI for Countries\u2060, our new global initiative to help interested governments build sovereign AI capability in coordination with the U.S. government,\u201d writes OpenAI. \u201cUnder the partnership, the UAE will become the first country in the world to enable ChatGPT nationwide \u2014 giving people across the country the ability to access OpenAI\u2019s technology.\u201d\nThe unveiling of Stargate UAE comes the same week as billionaire Elon Musk said his AI company, xAI, would build the world\u2019s first \u201cgigawatt\u201d AI training cluster.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft says Lumma password stealer malware found on 394,000 Windows PCs\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft and law enforcement have announced a court-authorized takedown of Lumma, a prolific info-stealer malware operation found on more than 394,000 Windows PCs globally, mostly in Brazil, Europe, and the United States.\nThe tech giant took civil action to ask a federal court to seize 2,300 domains that served as the malware\u2019s network of command and control servers. The Justice Department also seized five domains used to operate the Lumma infrastructure.\nThe Lumma password stealer can be found in dodgy games or cracked apps downloaded from the internet. Once infected, the malware steals logins, passwords, credit cards, and cryptocurrency wallets from the victim\u2019s computer, which are sold to other cybercriminals. Lumma also serves as a backdoor for hackers who want to drop additional malware, like ransomware.\nPassword-stealing malware like Lumma have been linked to cyberattacks used to steal huge amounts of data from tech companies, like PowerSchool and Snowflake.\n\ntitle2:\nKlarna CEO and Sutter Hill take victory lap after Jony Ive's OpenAI deal\ndescription2:\nHours after Sam Altman and Jony Ive announced on Wednesday that OpenAI was buying Ive\u2019s company, io, in an all-stock transaction valued at $6.5 billion, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski posted a surprising message on X.\nSiemiatkowski\u2019s family investment office, Flat Capital, had bought shares in io six months earlier, he said. Since this is an all-stock deal, those io shares will be converted into shares in the for-profit arm of OpenAI.\n\u201cExcited that @FlatCapital was an investor in io and that we will now receive even more shares in OpenAI at a hefty return for an investment we did some 6 months ago,\u201d Siemiatkowski tweeted.\nThe post generated so much interest that his investment firm issued a public statement confirming that io was the mystery, unnamed company it backed when it announced its four investments in a \u201cmini-portfolio\u201d of U.S. AI companies. Flat Capital disclosed that it spent 34 million SEK on io, which converts to about $3.6 million.\nThen came another surprising tweet from former Googler and designer Luke Wroblewski, who now works as a managing director at the secretive Silicon Valley VC powerhouse firm Sutter Hill Ventures.\nIn a since-deleted tweet and LinkedIn post, Wroblewski wrote, \u201ccongrats to io on the $6.5B acquisition by OpenAI today. happy to have been investors in this one.\u201d\nAccording to some who saw additional now-deleted tweets about Sutter\u2019s investment, the firm may have been the second largest investor in io. TechCrunch couldn\u2019t confirm that, though. Sutter didn\u2019t respond to our request for comment, and Wroblewski deleted his posts after we reached out.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nThe biggest investor in io was OpenAI itself, with a 23% stake, sources told Bloomberg, adding that this stake was valued at around $1.5 billion. That means OpenAI paid about $5 billion in stock for the remaining shares. Other io backers, Bloomberg reported, included Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 firm Emerson Collective, Thrive Capital, Maverick Ventures, SV Angel, and the OpenAI Fund. As we previously reported, that fund isn\u2019t backed with the AI model maker\u2019s money but by outside investors. Despite the deleted tweets, Bloomberg also confirmed Sutter Hill Ventures was an investor.\n\ntitle3:\nMozilla is shutting down read-it-later app Pocket\ndescription3:\nMozilla announced on Thursday that it\u2019s shutting down Pocket, a read-it-later app it acquired in 2017, on July 8. The company is also shutting down Fakespot, its browser extension that helps users identify unreliable reviews.\n\u201cPocket has helped millions save articles and discover stories worth reading,\u201d Mozilla said in a blog post. \u201cBut the way people use the web has evolved, so we\u2019re channeling our resources into projects that better match their browsing habits and online needs.\u201d\nUsers will be able to continue using the app and browser extensions for Pocket until July 8. After that date, Pocket will move into export-only mode. Users have until October 8 to export saved articles, including items in their list, archive, favorites, notes, and highlights.\nWhile Mozilla did not provide a specific reason for shutting down the service, the company says it will continue to invest in helping people discover and \u201caccess high quality web content.\u201d Mozilla says it will do this through its New Tab experience, email newsletter, and more. The New Tab experience features shortcuts to your most visited sites, your recently visited pages, and your bookmarks.\nAs for Fakespot, Mozilla says it\u2019s shutting down the service because \u201cwhile the idea resonated, it didn\u2019t fit a model we could sustain.\u201d\nAlthough it\u2019s unclear how many users Pocket had, the service was able to cultivate a loyal userbase over the years. Users have taken to social media to voice their displeasure with the news.\n\u201cThis shift allows us to shape the next era of the internet \u2014 with tools like vertical tabs, smart search and more AI-powered features on the way,\u201d Mozilla says. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to build a browser that works harder for you: more personal, more powerful and still proudly independent.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nAnthropic CEO claims AI models hallucinate less than humans\ndescription4:\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei believes today\u2019s AI models hallucinate, or make things up and present them as if they\u2019re true, at a lower rate than humans do, he said during a press briefing at Anthropic\u2019s first developer event, Code with Claude, in San Francisco on Thursday.\nAmodei said all this in the midst of a larger point he was making: that AI hallucinations are not a limitation on Anthropic\u2019s path to AGI \u2014 AI systems with human-level intelligence or better.\n\u201cIt really depends how you measure it, but I suspect that AI models probably hallucinate less than humans, but they hallucinate in more surprising ways,\u201d Amodei said, responding to TechCrunch\u2019s question.\nAnthropic\u2019s CEO is one of the most bullish leaders in the industry on the prospect of AI models achieving AGI. In a widely circulated paper he wrote last year, Amodei said he believed AGI could arrive as soon as 2026. During Thursday\u2019s press briefing, the Anthropic CEO said he was seeing steady progress to that end, noting that \u201cthe water is rising everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s always looking for these hard blocks on what [AI] can do,\u201d said Amodei. \u201cThey\u2019re nowhere to be seen. There\u2019s no such thing.\u201d\nOther AI leaders believe hallucination presents a large obstacle to achieving AGI. Earlier this week, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said today\u2019s AI models have too many \u201choles,\u201d and get too many obvious questions wrong. For example, earlier this month, a lawyer representing Anthropic was forced to apologize in court after they used Claude to create citations in a court filing, and the AI chatbot hallucinated and got names and titles wrong.\nIt\u2019s difficult to verify Amodei\u2019s claim, largely because most hallucination benchmarks pit AI models against each other; they don\u2019t compare models to humans. Certain techniques seem to be helping lower hallucination rates, such as giving AI models access to web search. Separately, some AI models, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5, have notably lower hallucination rates on benchmarks compared to early generations of systems.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere. For a limited time, tickets are just $292 for an entire day of expert talks, workshops, and potent networking.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nHowever, there\u2019s also evidence to suggest hallucinations are actually getting worse in advanced reasoning AI models. OpenAI\u2019s o3 and o4-mini models have higher hallucination rates than OpenAI\u2019s previous-gen reasoning models, and the company doesn\u2019t really understand why.\nLater in the press briefing, Amodei pointed out that TV broadcasters, politicians, and humans in all types of professions make mistakes all the time. The fact that AI makes mistakes too is not a knock on its intelligence, according to Amodei. However, Anthropic\u2019s CEO acknowledged the confidence with which AI models present untrue things as facts might be a problem.\nIn fact, Anthropic has done a fair amount of research on the tendency for AI models to deceive humans, a problem that seemed especially prevalent in the company\u2019s recently launched Claude Opus 4. Apollo Research, a safety institute given early access to test the AI model, found that an early version of Claude Opus 4 exhibited a high tendency to scheme against humans and deceive them. Apollo went as far as to suggest Anthropic shouldn\u2019t have released that early model. Anthropic said it came up with some mitigations that appeared to address the issues Apollo raised.\nAmodei\u2019s comments suggest that Anthropic may consider an AI model to be AGI, or equal to human-level intelligence, even if it still hallucinates. An AI that hallucinates may fall short of AGI by many people\u2019s definition, though.\"\n\nResponse:",
