Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday February 10), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nWaymo is testing driverless robotaxis in Nashville\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nWaymo has pulled the human safety driver from its autonomous test vehicles in Nashville, as the Alphabet-owned company moves closer to launching a robotaxi service in the city.\nWaymo, which has been testing in Nashville for months, is slated to launch a robotaxi service there this year in partnership with Lyft. Riders will initially hail rides directly through the Waymo app. Once the service expands, Waymo will also make its self-driving vehicles available through the Lyft app. Lyft has said it will handle fleet services, such as vehicle readiness and maintenance, charging infrastructure, and depot operations, through its wholly owned subsidiary Flexdrive.\nWaymo has accelerated its robotaxi expansion and today operates commercial services in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Phoenix. It also has driverless test fleets in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando.\nThe company tends to follow the same rollout strategy in every new market, starting with a small fleet of vehicles that are manually driven to map the city. The autonomous vehicles are then tested with a human safety operator in the driver\u2019s seat. Eventually, the company conducts driverless testing, often allowing employees to hail rides, before launching a robotaxi service.\n\ntitle1:\nDatabricks CEO says SaaS isn't dead, but AI will soon make it irrelevant\ndescription1:\nOn Monday, Databricks announced it reached a $5.4 billion revenue run rate, growing 65% year-over-year, of which more than $1.4 billion was from its AI products.\nCo-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi wanted to share these growth numbers because there\u2019s so much talk about how AI is going to kill the SaaS business, he told TechCrunch.\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s SaaS. What\u2019s going to happen to all these companies? What\u2019s AI going to do with all these companies?\u2019 For us, it\u2019s just increasing the usage,\u201d he said.\nTo be sure, he also wants to distance Databricks from the SaaS label, given that private markets value it as an AI company. Databricks on Monday also officially closed on its massive, previously announced $5 billion raise at a $134 billion valuation, and nabbed a $2 billion loan facility as well.\nBut the company is straddling both worlds. Databricks is still best known as a cloud data warehouse provider. A data warehouse is where enterprises store massive amounts of data to analyze for business insights.\nGhodsi called out, in particular, one AI product that\u2019s driving usage of its data warehouse: its LLM user interface named Genie.\nGenie is an example of how a SaaS business can replace its user interface with natural language. For instance, he uses it to ask why warehouse usage and revenue spike on particular days.\nJust a few years ago, such a request required writing queries in a specific technical language, or having a special report programmed. Today, any product with an LLM interface can be used by anyone, Ghodsi noted. Genie is one reason for the company\u2019s usage growth numbers, he said.\nThe threat of AI to SaaS isn\u2019t, as one AI VC jokingly tweeted, that enterprises will rip out their SaaS \u201csystems of record\u201d to replace them with vibe-coded homegrown versions. Systems of record store critical business data, whether it\u2019s on sales, customer support, or finance.\n\u201cWhy would you move your system of record? You know, it\u2019s hard to move it,\u201d Ghodsi said.\nThe model makers aren\u2019t offering databases to store that data and become systems of record anyway. Instead, they hope to replace the user interface with natural language for human use, or APIs or other plug-ins for AI agents.\nSo the threat to SaaS businesses, Ghodsi says, is that people no longer spend their careers becoming masters of a particular product: Salesforce specialists, or ServiceNow, or SAP. Once the interface is just language, the products become invisible, like plumbing.\n\u201cMillions of people around the world got trained on those user interfaces. And so that was the biggest moat that those businesses have,\u201d Ghodsi warned.\nSaaS companies that embrace the new LLM interface could grow, as Databricks is doing. But it also opens up possibilities for AI-native competitors to offer alternatives that work better with AI and agents.\nThat\u2019s why Databricks created its Lakebase database designed for agents. He\u2019s seeing early traction. \u201cIn its eight months that we\u2019ve had it in the market, it\u2019s done twice as much revenue as our data warehouse had when it was eight months old. Okay, obviously, that\u2019s like comparing toddlers,\u201d Ghodsi says. \u201cBut this is a toddler that\u2019s twice as big.\u201d\nMeanwhile, now that Databricks has closed on its massive funding round, Ghodsi tells us that the company is not immediately working on another raise, nor prepping for an IPO.\n\u201cNow is not a great time to go public,\u201d Ghodsi said. \u201cI just wanted to be really well capitalized\u201d should the markets go \u201csouth\u201d again as they did in the 2022 downturn, when interest rates rose sharply after years of near-zero rates. A thick bank account \u201cprotects us, gives us many, many years of runway,\u201d he added.\n\ntitle2:\nLidar-maker Ouster buys vision company StereoLabs as sensor consolidation continues\ndescription2:\nLidar-maker Ouster has acquired StereoLabs, a company that makes vision-based perception systems for robotics and industrial applications, for a combination of $35 million and 1.8 million shares.\nThe deal is the latest in a march toward consolidation among perception sensor suppliers. Just last month, MicroVision bought the lidar assets of the buzzy-but-now-bankrupt Luminar for $33 million. Ouster itself has played the M&A game a fair amount, too. In 2022, the company merged with rival player Velodyne. The year before that, it bought lidar startup Sense Photonics.\nThis consolidation is happening right as companies and investors rush to build businesses around \u201cphysical AI\u201d \u2014 a broad term that encompasses everything from humanoid robotics and drones to self-driving cars and automated systems in warehouses. Even more obscure suppliers are raising big funding rounds as these technologies develop. Some startups are even trying to spin up entirely new sensor modalities.\nOuster co-founder and CEO Angus Pacala told TechCrunch in an interview that he had been eyeing StereoLabs for years. He said he sees lidar as \u201cthe core component of safety-critical, capable systems,\u201d but that he wanted to \u201cmove up the stack.\u201d\nThe \u201cobvious additional sensors\u201d to start working with in addition to lidar, Pacala said, are cameras. Pacala said 15-year-old StereoLabs is \u201cbest in class\u201d on the hardware side, but he was especially drawn to how the company has been getting the most out of those cameras by being \u201cincredibly savvy in adopting the cutting edge of AI models and edge compute.\u201d\nIn particular, Pacala highlighted StereoLabs\u2019 development of a foundational AI model that can determine depth of objects from stereo cameras.\n\u201cIt was a no-brainer for us to go out and approach them and basically pitch this vision of working with us to become a unified sensing and perception platform \u2014 a tier one [supplier] for these advanced physical AI systems,\u201d Pacala said.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nDespite the focus on integration, Ouster said StereoLabs will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.\nAnd while the hype has been feverish, Pacala said he didn\u2019t buy StereoLabs simply because of the attention and money being thrown at physical AI. In fact, he committed maybe the gravest sin one can during a hype cycle: he poured some cold water on the buzz, especially around humanoid robotics.\n\u201cThe business model here is not to just sell the fervor, it\u2019s to actually make working systems that are certified, that are safe, that are really solving customer problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a little bit of disillusionment in physical AI as it turns out that it\u2019s much longer time to market for all these humanoids.\u201d\nPacala isn\u2019t the only one trying to take a realistic view. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, MicroVision CEO Glen DeVos said the sensor industry is \u201cripe for consolidation\u201d because he believes there isn\u2019t enough revenue to support all the current competition.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get consolidation, or you\u2019re going to get kind of a weeding out of the industry as people fall to the wayside,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle3:\nMrBeast's company buys Gen Z-focused fintech app Step\ndescription3:\nYouTube megastar MrBeast announced on Monday that his company, Beast Industries, is buying Step, a teen-focused banking app.\nStep, which raised half a billion in funding and has grown to over 7 million users, offers financial services geared toward Gen Z to help them build credit, save money, and invest. The company has attracted celebrity investors like Charli D\u2019Amelio, Will Smith, The Chainsmokers, and Stephen Curry, in addition to venture firms like General Catalyst, Coatue, and the payments company Stripe.\nIf the company wants to continue getting its fintech product in front of young eyes, then partnering with Gen Z phenom MrBeast is wise. MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, is the most-subscribed creator on YouTube, with over 466 million subscribers, but his ambitions stretch beyond his over-the-top videos.\n\u201cNobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,\u201d the 27-year-old said. \u201cI want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.\u201d\nI'm so excited to share that we are acquiring the financial services app, @step\nNobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That's exactly why we\u2019re joining forces with Step! I want to give millions of young people the financial\u2026 \u2014 MrBeast (@MrBeast) February 9, 2026\nThis acquisition makes sense, considering that a leaked pitch document from last year showed this was an area of interest for Beast Industries. The company is also reportedly interested in launching a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), a lower-cost cell phone plan similar to Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Mint Mobile.\nIn line with other top creators, Beast Industries\u2019 business is much more than YouTube ad revenue. (In fact, the company reinvests much of that money back into the content.) The company\u2019s cash cow is the chocolate brand Feastables, which is more profitable than both the MrBeast YouTube channel and the Prime Video show \u201cBeast Games,\u201d according to leaked documents reported on by Bloomberg. Some of his other ventures, like Lunchly and MrBeast Burger, have struggled.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about how this acquisition is going to amplify our platform and bring more groundbreaking products to Step customers,\u201d Step founder and CEO CJ MacDonald said in a statement.\n\ntitle4:\nChatGPT rolls out ads\ndescription4:\nOpenAI on Monday announced it\u2019s beginning to test ads in the U.S. for users on its Free and Go subscription tiers.\nThe newer Go plan is a low-cost subscription at $8 per month in the U.S. and was introduced globally in mid-January.\nSubscribers to OpenAI\u2019s paid plans, including its Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers, will not see ads, the company said.\nOpenAI sought to address concerns about how ads might affect the user experience, stating in a blog post: \u201cAds do not influence the answers ChatGPT gives you, and we keep your conversations with ChatGPT private from advertisers. Our goal is for ads to support broader access to more powerful ChatGPT features while maintaining the trust people place in ChatGPT for important and personal tasks.\u201d\nThe move, which the company announced last month, drew ridicule in a series of Super Bowl ads that ran on Sunday from a top rival, Anthropic.\nIn its TV commercials, Anthropic poked fun at the idea that some AI companies, like OpenAI, would soon include advertising by showing how poorly integrated ads could disrupt the consumer experience. This was portrayed on-screen by glassy-eyed actors playing AI chatbots, who would deliver their advice alongside a poorly targeted ad.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman got extremely testy about the jabs, calling the ads \u201cdishonest\u201d and Anthropic an \u201cauthoritarian company.\u201d\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nConsumers have so far resisted the idea of ads in AI responses. OpenAI faced a backlash late last year when it tested app suggestions that looked like unwanted ads. Still, the AI company needs to generate revenue from its popular chatbot to cover the costs of developing its technology and growing the business.\nWhile understandable, critics fear that ads could influence ChatGPT\u2019s answers. OpenAI denies this in its announcement, saying that ads will be optimized based on \u201cwhat\u2019s most helpful to you.\u201d The company says ads will also always be clearly labeled as sponsored and separated from the organic content.\nIn tests, OpenAI has tried matching ads to users based on the subject of their conversations, past chats, and previous ad interactions. For instance, users researching recipes might see ads for grocery delivery services or meal kits, the company says. OpenAI said advertisers won\u2019t have access to user data, only aggregate information about ad performance, like views and clicks.\nUsers will also be able to view their history of interactions with ads and clear it at any time. Plus, OpenAI said users can dismiss ads, share feedback, view why they were shown an ad, and manage ad personalization settings.\nAds won\u2019t be shown to users under 18, nor will they be placed near sensitive or regulated topics like health, politics, or mental health.\"\n\nResponse:",
