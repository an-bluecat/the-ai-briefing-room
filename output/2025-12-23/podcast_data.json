Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Just last month, Armis raised a $435 million pre-IPO funding round, which valued the company at $6.1 billion.\nArmis co-founder and CEO Yevgeny Dibrov had told TechCrunch last month that the company aims to go public in late 2026 or 2027, adding that an IPO is his \u201cpersonal dream.\u201d\nGiven the unpredictability of IPO markets and how few cybersecurity companies actually go public, it is not a surprise that Armis ultimately chose an M&A exit.\nAccording to ServiceNow, Armis has reached $340 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), with year-over-year growth exceeding 50%.\nArmis, which provides security software for critical infrastructure to Fortune 500 companies and governments, will help ServiceNow expand its cybersecurity offerings.\nThe deal caps off a busy acquisition year for ServiceNow, which scooped up Moveworks for $2.85 billion and agreed to acquire cybersecurity startup Veza for $1 billion.\nAccording to PitchBook, Armis has raised a total of $1.45 billion in venture capital from investors, including Sequoia, CapitalG, and Insight Partners.\n\ntitle1:\nUS insurance giant Aflac says hackers stole personal and health data of 22.6 million people\ndescription1:\nIn June, U.S. insurance giant Aflac disclosed a data breach where hackers stole customers\u2019 personal information, including Social Security numbers and health information, without saying how many victims were affected.\nOn Tuesday, the company confirmed it has begun notifying around 22.65 million people whose data was stolen during the cyberattack.\nIn a filing with the Texas attorney general, Aflac said that the stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, home addresses, government-issued ID numbers (such as passports and state ID cards) and driver\u2019s license numbers, and Social Security numbers, as well as medical and health insurance information.\nAnd, in a filing with the Iowa attorney general, Aflac said that the cybercriminals responsible for the breach \u201cmay be affiliated with a known cyber-criminal organization; federal law enforcement and third-party cybersecurity experts have indicated that this group may have been targeting the insurance industry at large.\u201d\nGiven that Scattered Spider, an amorphous collective of primarily young English-speaking hackers, was targeting the insurance industry at the time of the breach, it\u2019s likely that this is the group Aflac is referring to.\nA spokesperson for Aflac did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nThe company says it has around 50 million customers according to its official website.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAflac was one of several insurance companies hacked at around the same time, including data breaches at Erie Insurance and Philadelphia Insurance Companies.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon's AI assistant Alexa+ now works with Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp\ndescription2:\nAmazon is expanding its AI-powered digital assistant Alexa+ with new capabilities. The company announced on Thursday that it\u2019s adding four new integrations to the service that will allow the assistant to work with Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp starting in 2026.\nThese additions allow customers to book hotels, get quotes for home services, and schedule salon appointments, among other things. With Expedia, customers can compare, book, and manage hotel reservations, or tell Alexa their preferences to get personalized recommendations. (e.g. \u201cCan you find me pet-friendly hotels for this weekend in Chicago?\u201d)\nThe new services join Alexa+\u2019s existing integrations with Fodor, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nSimilar to how ChatGPT is now integrating apps into its chatbot, Amazon aims to make it easier for consumers to use various online services through its digital assistant. For instance, you could ask Alexa to call you an Uber or book a table for dinner with OpenTable.\nYou also can converse with the AI assistant in natural language, having back-and-forth conversations, refining your request as you go.\nWhether users will take to this idea, of course, remains to be seen.\nImage Credits:Amazon\nHowever, Amazon did offer a small glimpse as to how Alexa+ early adopters have been using the integrations, noting that, so far, home and personal service providers like Thumbtack and Vagaro have seen \u201cstrong\u201d engagement.\nUsing AI assistants as app platforms is a model that\u2019s being tested across the industry as another way to bring AI to consumers more broadly. But this will require users to adapt to a new way of doing things, as many are used to engaging with online services through the web or mobile apps. To be successful in getting consumers to change their behavior, using apps via AI will need to be seen as being as easy, if not easier, than the existing model.\nFor that to work, the AI providers would need to at least match the breadth of online services provided by a traditional app store, which is already a more curated selection than what\u2019s available via the web. Or, providers will need to get very good at suggesting apps to use at the right time, without seeming overly pushy, as users can perceive unwelcome prompts as ads.\n\ntitle3:\nTrump administration's ban on foreign-made drones starts this week - you can say goodbye to new DJI models\ndescription3:\nOn Monday, the Trump administration\u2019s Federal Communications Commission banned all new foreign-made drone models from distribution in the U.S., citing \u201cnational security concerns.\u201d Americans who already own older foreign drone models will still be able to use those products, the government said.\nIn a fact sheet published Monday, the FCC claimed that \u201ccriminals, hostile foreign actors, and terrorists\u201d could use drones \u201cto present new and serious threats to our homeland.\u201d As a result, the agency said that it had updated its Covered List \u2014 which is a list of products that have been \u201cdeemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security\u201d of the country \u2014 to include all \u201cUAS and UAS critical components produced abroad.\u201d\nThe FCC\u2019s chairman, Brendan Carr, said Monday that he approved of the policy. \u201cI welcome this Executive Branch national security determination, and I am pleased that the FCC has now added foreign drones and related components, which pose an unacceptable national security risk, to the FCC\u2019s Covered List,\u201d Carr said. \u201cFollowing President Trump\u2019s leadership, the FCC will work closely with U.S. drone makers to unleash American drone dominance.\u201d\nThe new rule will obviously impact many different companies, but it is destined to strike a blow against Chinese drone maker DJI, which is currently considered the dominant player in drone sales globally. Indeed, DJI is considered to be one of the most popular drone brands for American consumers.\nWhen reached for comment by TechCrunch, DJI said it disapproved of the decision. \u201cDJI is disappointed by the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s action today to add foreign\u2011made drones to the Covered List. While DJI was not singled out, no information has been released regarding what information was used by the Executive Branch in reaching its determination.\u201d\nThe company, which said that it remained committed to the U.S. market, continued: \u201cAs the industry leader, DJI has advocated for an open, competitive market that benefits all US consumers and commercial users, and will continue to do so. DJI products are among the safest and most secure on the market, supported by years of reviews conducted by U.S. government agencies and independent third parties.\u201d\nThroughout his multiple presidential administrations, Trump has repeatedly played hardball with Chinese companies. His administration laid the groundwork for the new drone ban with an executive order passed in June that sought to boost the production of U.S.-made drones and thus foster a \u201cstrong and secure domestic drone sector,\u201d while also securing \u201cthe United States drone supply chain against foreign control or exploitation.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nJohn Carreyrou and other authors bring new lawsuit against six major AI companies\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nA group of writers, including Theranos whistleblower and \u201cBad Blood\u201d author John Carreyrou, is filing a lawsuit against Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity, accusing the companies of training their models on pirated copies of their books.\nIf this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because another set of authors already filed a class action suit against Anthropic for these same acts of copyright infringement. In that case, the judge ruled that it was legal for Anthropic and similar AI companies to train on pirated copies of books, but that it was not legal to pirate the books in the first place.\nWhile eligible writers can receive about $3,000 from the $1.5 billion Anthropic settlement, some authors were dissatisfied with that resolution \u2014 it doesn\u2019t hold AI companies accountable for the actual act of using stolen books to train their models, which generate billions of dollars in revenue.\nAccording to the new lawsuit, the plaintiffs say that the proposed Anthropic settlement \u201cseems to serve [the AI companies], not creators.\u201d\n\u201cLLM companies should not be able to so easily extinguish thousands upon thousands of high-value claims at bargain-basement rates, eliding what should be the true cost of their massive willful infringement,\u201d the lawsuit says.\"\n\nResponse:",
