    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday December 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nDatabricks raises $10B as it barrels toward an IPO\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nDatabricks, the data analytics platform, has raised $10 billion in a funding round that values the company at $62 billion (up from $43 billion). Backers include Thrive Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, DST Global, GIC, and Iconiq Growth.\nThe round is one of the largest venture rounds in history, and will drive future mergers and acquisitions, stock payouts to employees, and expansion abroad, according to a statement obtained by CNBC.\nDatabricks\u2019 mammoth \u201cSeries J\u201d comes ahead of the company\u2019s hotly anticipated IPO. Founded in 2013 by seven doctorate candidates from UC Berkeley, Databricks sells AI, big data analytics, and cloud tooling to enable companies to build data- and AI-powered applications.\nDatabricks expects to generate positive free cash flow for the first time with a $3 billion revenue run rate in the quarter that ends on January 31, according to CNBC. The company\u2019s revenue in the October quarter grew more than 60% year over year.\n\ntitle1:\nSalesforce plans to hire 2,000 people to sell its AI products\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nCloud software giant Salesforce is looking to hire thousands of new salespeople to sell its AI tools to customers.\nThe company plans to hire 2,000 new sales representatives, according to CNBC, which cited remarks from CEO Marc Benioff at a company event Tuesday. This doubles the hiring plans that Benioff shared with Bloomberg last month. Benioff said that Salesforce has already received 9,000 referrals for these 2,000 positions.\nThis bulking up comes just months before the company plans to release the second generation of its AI agent software in February.\nBenioff recently said on TechCrunch\u2019s Equity podcast that he expects Salesforce will have more than a billion agents running in the next 12 months. Regarding generative AI generally, Benioff added, \u201cI\u2019ve never been more excited about anything at Salesforce, maybe in my career.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nThe DOJ wants a Perplexity executive to testify in its Google antitrust case\ndescription2:\nA U.S. court ruled in August that Google has a search monopoly, and while Google appeals, the Justice Department is figuring out what kind of potential penalties to impose \u2014 like breaking off Chrome.\nAs part of this process, the DOJ wants to call on a specific witness, according to a recent court filing: Dmitry Shevelenko, chief business officer of Perplexity, an AI search provider most recently valued at $9 billion, per Reuters.\nPerplexity and other generative AI tools like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search have emerged as a potential replacement for searching the internet, as they can offer direct answers to complicated queries (albeit, sometimes with made-up or inaccurate information). Google has responded to the threat with its own AI search tools, such as AI Overviews, which provide AI-generated answers above search results.\nThe DOJ wants to ask Shevelenko about \u201cgenerative AI\u2019s relationship with Search Access Points, distribution, barriers to entry and expansion, and data sharing.\u201d\n\u201cSearch access points\u201d is a term the DOJ uses to describe things like Google Chrome \u2014 places where people go to search the internet.\nWhile the filing doesn\u2019t spell out exactly why the DOJ wants to ask Perplexity about these topics, it could help its argument that Google monopolizes the search business and closes out potential competitors, and thus deserves stronger penalties.\nTechCrunch asked Perplexity whether it has agreed to have its executive testify and for its thoughts on the antitrust case. Perplexity didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment, and neither did Google.\nPerplexity is effectively caught in the middle of the dispute, as both sides want information from it that could help their cases. Google subpoenaed Perplexity in October for company documents to make its own case that it has viable competition in the search field. (Google subpoenaed Microsoft and OpenAI as well.)\nHowever, Perplexity has yet to provide \u201ca single document\u201d to Google as of December 11, the tech giant lamented in a court filing, claiming that there is \u201cno conceivable justification for further delay\u201d after two months of waiting.\nFor its part, Perplexity says in the filing that it has already agreed to fulfill 12 out of Google\u2019s 14 document requests but is \u201cstill evaluating the burden associated with collecting such a potentially expansive universe of documents.\u201d\nPerplexity also says that while it has agreed to provide copies of licensing agreements \u201crelated to AI training,\u201d Google wants all of Perplexity\u2019s licensing agreements and that it has asked Google to \u201cmeet and confer\u201d about this.\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia falls deeper into correction territory, Broadcom reverses earlier gains to tick lower\ndescription3:\nNvidia shares closed down more than 1% on Tuesday, as Broadcom shares reversed earlier gains to also move lower.\nOn Monday, Nvidia entered correction territory \u2014 broadly defined as the point when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high close.\nNvidia hit its closing high of $148.88 last month.\nAfter initial rising in trading before the bell, Broadcom shares closed down 4%.\nStill, over the past five days the two names have been on diverging paths with Broadcom shares rallying while Nvidia shares slipped.\nBullishness around Broadcom has been fueled by the company's release last week of fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations and a revenue outlook for the current quarter that beat forecasts. A number of Wall Street brokers, including Goldman Sachs, have raised their price targets on Broadcom's stock recently.\n\ntitle4:\nUK kicks off review into training AI models on copyrighted content\ndescription4:\nOn Dec. 9, OpenAI made its artificial intelligence video generation model Sora publicly available in the U.S. and other countries. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty Images\nThe U.K. is drawing up measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content by tech companies to train their artificial intelligence models. The British government on Tuesday kicked off a consultation which aims to increase clarity for both the creative industries and AI developers when it comes to both how intellectual property is obtained and then used by AI firms for training purposes. Some artists and publishers are unhappy with the way their content is being scraped freely by companies like OpenAI and Google to train their large language models \u2014 AI models trained on huge quantities of data to generate humanlike responses. Large language models are the foundational technology behind today's generative AI systems, including the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude. Last year, The New York Times brought a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI accusing the companies of infringing its copyright and abusing intellectual property to train large language models. In response, OpenAI disputed the NYT's allegations, stating that the use of open web data for training AI models should be considered \"fair use\" and that it provides an \"opt-out\" for rights holders \"because it's the right thing to do.\"\nSeparately, image distribution platform Getty Images sued another generative AI firm, Stability AI, in the U.K., accusing it of scraping millions of images from its websites without consent to train its Stable Diffusion AI model. Stability AI has disputed the suit, noting that the training and development of its model took place outside the U.K.\nProposals to be considered\nFirst, the consultation will consider making an exception to copyright law for AI training when used in the context of commercial purposes but while still allowing rights holders to reserve their rights so they can control the use of their content. Second, the consultation will put forward proposed measures to help creators license and be remunerated for the use of their content by AI model makers, as well as give AI developers clarity over what material can be used for training their models. The government said more work needs to be done by both the creative industries and technology firms to ensure any standards and requirements for rights reservation and transparency are effective, accessible and widely adopted. The government is also considering proposals that would require AI model makers to be more transparent about their model training datasets and how they're obtained so that rights holders can understand when and how their content has been used to train AI.\nwatch now\nThat could prove controversial \u2014 technology firms aren't especially forthcoming when it comes to the data that fuels their coveted algorithms or how they train them up, given the commercial sensitivities involved in revealing those secrets to potential competitors. Previously, under former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, the government attempted to agree a voluntary AI copyright code of practice.\nAI copyright rules: U.K. versus U.S.\nIn a recent interview with CNBC, the boss of app development software firm Appian said he thinks the U.K. is well placed to be the \"global leader on this issue.\" \"The U.K. has put a stake in the ground declaring its prioritization of personal intellectual property rights,\" Matt Calkins, Appian's CEO, told CNBC. He cited 2018's Data Protection Act as an example of how the U.K. is \"closely associated with intellectual property rights.\" The U.K. is also not \"subject to the same overwhelming lobbying blitz from domestic AI leaders that the U.S. is,\" Calkins added \u2014 meaning it might not be as prone to bowing down to pressure from tech giants as politicians stateside. \"In the U.S., anybody who writes a law about AI is going to hear from Amazon, Oracle, Microsoft or Google before that bill even reaches the floor,\" Calkins said. \"That's a powerful force stopping anyone from writing sensible legislation or protecting the rights of individuals whose intellectual property is being taken wholesale by these major AI players.\" The issue of potential copyright infringement by AI firms is becoming more notable as tech firms are moving toward a more \"multimodal\" form of AI \u2014 that is, AI systems that can understand and generate content in the form of images and video as well as text. Last week, OpenAI made its AI video generation model Sora publicly available in the U.S. and \"most countries internationally.\" The tool allows a user to type out a desired scene and produce a high-definition video clip.\"\n\nResponse:",
