    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday March 10), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft reportedly ramps up AI efforts to compete with OpenAI\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft is accelerating its push to compete with OpenAI, its longtime collaborator, by developing its own powerful AI models and exploring alternatives to power products like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot bot.\nMicrosoft has developed its own AI \u201creasoning\u201d models comparable to models like OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3-mini, the The Information reports. OpenAI is said to have refused Microsoft\u2019s requests for technical details about how o1 works \u2014 stoking tensions between the firms.\nMicrosoft has also developed a family of models called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI\u2019s own, Bloomberg reports, and is reportedly considering offering them through an API later this year. Parallel to those efforts, Microsoft is said to be testing alternative AI models from xAI, Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek as possible replacements for OpenAI technology in Copilot.\nMicrosoft, which has invested around $14 billion in OpenAI to date, has looked to hedge its bets in a number of ways, including hiring DeepMind and Inflection co-founder Mustafa Suleyman to lead the tech giant\u2019s AI efforts.\n\ntitle1:\nDiscord is discussing an IPO\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nDiscord \u2014 the chat app with over 200 million monthly users \u2014 is in early-stage talks to IPO, The New York Times reports. Discord\u2019s discussions with investment bankers are still exploratory and plans could change, per the NYT\u2019s sources.\nDiscord understands there is a lot of interest about its plans, but does not comment on rumors or speculation, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Discord has mulled over an IPO.\nThe San Francisco-based startup walked away from a $10 billion purchase by Microsoft in 2021 as it considered staying independent and going public.\nDiscord was last valued at $14.7 billion in a 2021 fundraise for $500 million.\nDiscord is especially popular in certain communities like video games and crypto, but it has also emerged as an unlikely center for the AI boom, with image generation companies like Midjourney operating on its server.\n\ntitle2:\nCursor in talks to raise at a $10B valuation as AI coding sector booms\ndescription2:\nInvestor interest in AI coding assistants is exploding.\nAnysphere, the developer of AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, is in talks with venture capitalists to raise capital at a valuation of nearly $10 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nThe round, if it transpires, would come about three months after Anysphere completed its previous fundraise of $100 million at a pre-money valuation of $2.5 billion, as TechCrunch was first to report. The new round is expected to be led by returning investor Thrive Capital.\nThrive Capital and Anysphere didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhile Anysphere\u2019s previous round valued the company at 25 times its $100 million ARR (per The New York Times), investors seem to be willing to value fast-growing companies at even higher multiples now. Anysphere\u2019s current annualized recurring revenue (ARR) may have already climbed to $150 million, The Information reported, which means the new deal, should it happen would be a whopping 66 times ARR.\nAnysphere isn\u2019t the only company receiving such a high valuation from investors.\nCodeium, a company behind AI coding editor Windsurf, is raising capital at a valuation of nearly $3 billion, TechCrunch reported last month. Kleiner Perkins, which is leading the round into Codeium, valued the company at about 70 times ARR of about $40 million.\nAI is adapting fastest in coding tools, outpacing its use in sales, law, healthcare, and other sectors, according to investors.\nIn recent weeks, investors have been approaching Poolside, another AI-powered coding company that is also developing its own LLM, sources tell TechCrunch and The Information. Poolside didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle3:\nUS lawmakers have already introduced hundreds of AI bills in 2025\ndescription3:\nJust over two months into 2025, the number of pending AI bills in the U.S. has grown to 781, according to an online tracking tool.\nThe tool, maintained by consulting firm MultiState, shows that the number of pending U.S. bills pertaining to AI now exceeds the total number of AI bills proposed in all of 2024 (743). In 2023, state and federal lawmakers proposed fewer than 200 AI-related bills.\nA few recently proposed laws include Maryland\u2019s H.B. 1331, a bill regulating the development and use of high-risk AI in consequential decisions; Texas\u2019 expansive Texas Responsible AI Governance Act; and Massachusetts\u2019 HD 3750, which would require healthcare insurance providers to disclose the use of AI for reviewing insurance claims.\nThe legislative chaos can largely be attributed to inaction at the federal level. So far, Congress has struggled to pass a comprehensive AI framework comparable to bills like the EU\u2019s AI Act.\nThe Trump administration hasn\u2019t shown an appetite for aggressive AI governance. In late January, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to promote the development of AI \u201cfree from ideological bias\u201d that promotes \u201chuman flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.\u201d But Trump has yet to endorse major congressional AI legislation.\n\ntitle4:\nSignal President Meredith Whittaker calls out agentic AI as having 'profound' security and privacy issues\ndescription4:\nSignal President Meredith Whittaker warned Friday that agentic AI could come with a risk to user privacy.\nSpeaking onstage at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, the advocate for secure communications referred to the use of AI agents as \u201cputting your brain in a jar,\u201d and cautioned that this new paradigm of computing \u2014 where AI performs tasks on users\u2019 behalf \u2014 has a \u201cprofound issue\u201d with both privacy and security.\nWhittaker explained how AI agents are being marketed as a way to add value to your life by handling various online tasks for the user. For instance, AI agents would be able to take on tasks like looking up concerts, booking tickets, scheduling the event on your calendar, and messaging your friends that it\u2019s booked.\n\u201cSo we can just put our brain in a jar because the thing is doing that and we don\u2019t have to touch it, right?,\u201d Whittaker mused.\nThen she explained the type of access the AI agent would need to perform these tasks, including access to our web browser and a way to drive it as well as access to our credit card information to pay for tickets, our calendar, and messaging app to send the text to your friends.\n\u201cIt would need to be able to drive that [process] across our entire system with something that looks like root permission, accessing every single one of those databases \u2014 probably in the clear, because there\u2019s no model to do that encrypted,\u201d Whittaker warned.\n\u201cAnd if we\u2019re talking about a sufficiently powerful \u2026 AI model that\u2019s powering that, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s happening on device,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s almost certainly being sent to a cloud server where it\u2019s being processed and sent back. So there\u2019s a profound issue with security and privacy that is haunting this hype around agents, and that is ultimately threatening to break the blood-brain barrier between the application layer and the OS layer by conjoining all of these separate services [and] muddying their data,\u201d Whittaker concluded.\nIf a messaging app like Signal were to integrate with AI agents, it would undermine the privacy of your messages, she said. The agent has to access the app to text your friends and also pull data back to summarize those texts.\nHer comments followed remarks she made earlier during the panel on how the AI industry had been built on a surveillance model with mass data collection. She said that the \u201cbigger is better AI paradigm\u201d \u2014 meaning the more data, the better \u2014 had potential consequences that she didn\u2019t think were good.\nWith agentic AI, Whittaker warned we\u2019d further undermine privacy and security in the name of a \u201cmagic genie bot that\u2019s going to take care of the exigencies of life,\u201d she concluded.\"\n\nResponse:",
