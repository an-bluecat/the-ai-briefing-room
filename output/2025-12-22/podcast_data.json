Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The company conceded that \u201cagent mode\u201d in ChatGPT Atlas \u201cexpands the security threat surface.\u201d\nOpenAI launched its ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers rushed to publish their demos, showing it was possible to write a few words in Google Docs that were capable of changing the underlying browser\u2019s behavior. That same day, Brave published a blog post explaining that indirect prompt injection is a systematic challenge for AI-powered browsers, including Perplexity\u2019s Comet.\nOpenAI isn\u2019t alone in recognizing that prompt-based injections aren\u2019t going away. The U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre earlier this month warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI applications \u201cmay never be totally mitigated,\u201d putting websites at risk of falling victim to data breaches. The U.K. government agency advised cyber professionals to reduce the risk and impact of prompt injections, rather than think the attacks can be \u201cstopped.\u201d\nFor OpenAI\u2019s part, the company said: \u201cWe view prompt injection as a long-term AI security challenge, and we\u2019ll need to continuously strengthen our defenses against it.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s answer to this Sisyphean task? A proactive, rapid-response cycle that the firm says is showing early promise in helping discover novel attack strategies internally before they are exploited \u201cin the wild.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not entirely different from what rivals like Anthropic and Google have been saying: that to fight against the persistent risk of prompt-based attacks, defenses must be layered and continuously stress-tested. Google\u2019s recent work, for example, focuses on architectural and policy-level controls for agentic systems.\nBut where OpenAI is taking a different tact is with its \u201cLLM-based automated attacker.\u201d This attacker is basically a bot that OpenAI trained, using reinforcement learning, to play the role of a hacker that looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions to an AI agent.\nThe bot can test the attack in simulation before using it for real, and the simulator shows how the target AI would think and what actions it would take if it saw the attack. The bot can then study that response, tweak the attack, and try again and again. That insight into the target AI\u2019s internal reasoning is something outsiders don\u2019t have access to, so, in theory, OpenAI\u2019s bot should be able to find flaws faster than a real-world attacker would.\nIt\u2019s a common tactic in AI safety testing: build an agent to find the edge cases and test against them rapidly in simulation.\n\u201cOur [reinforcement learning]-trained attacker can steer an agent into executing sophisticated, long-horizon harmful workflows that unfold over tens (or even hundreds) of steps,\u201d wrote OpenAI. \u201cWe also observed novel attack strategies that did not appear in our human red teaming campaign or external reports.\u201d\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nIn a demo (pictured in part above), OpenAI showed how its automated attacker slipped a malicious email into a user\u2019s inbox. When the AI agent later scanned the inbox, it followed the hidden instructions in the email and sent a resignation message instead of drafting an out-of-office reply. But following the security update, \u201cagent mode\u201d was able to successfully detect the prompt injection attempt and flag it to the user, according to the company.\nThe company says that while prompt injection is hard to secure against in a foolproof way, it\u2019s leaning on large-scale testing and faster patch cycles to harden its systems before they show up in real-world attacks.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson declined to share whether the update to Atlas\u2019 security has resulted in a measurable reduction in successful injections, but says the firm has been working with third parties to harden Atlas against prompt injection since before launch.\nRami McCarthy, principal security researcher at cybersecurity firm Wiz, says that reinforcement learning is one way to continuously adapt to attacker behavior, but it\u2019s only part of the picture.\n\u201cA useful way to reason about risk in AI systems is autonomy multiplied by access,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch.\n\u201cAgentic browsers tend to sit in a challenging part of that space: moderate autonomy combined with very high access,\u201d said McCarthy. \u201cMany current recommendations reflect that trade-off. Limiting logged-in access primarily reduces exposure, while requiring review of confirmation requests constrains autonomy.\u201d\nThose are two of OpenAI\u2019s recommendations for users to reduce their own risk, and a spokesperson said Atlas is also trained to get user confirmation before sending messages or making payments. OpenAI also suggests that users give agents specific instructions, rather than providing them access to your inbox and telling them to \u201ctake whatever action is needed.\u201d\n\u201cWide latitude makes it easier for hidden or malicious content to influence the agent, even when safeguards are in place,\u201d per OpenAI.\nWhile OpenAI says protecting Atlas users against prompt injections is a top priority, McCarthy invites some skepticism as to the return on investment for risk-prone browsers.\n\u201cFor most everyday use cases, agentic browsers don\u2019t yet deliver enough value to justify their current risk profile,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201cThe risk is high given their access to sensitive data like email and payment information, even though that access is also what makes them powerful. That balance will evolve, but today the trade-offs are still very real.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nAlphabet to buy Intersect Power to bypass energy grid bottlenecks\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nGoogle parent Alphabet has agreed to buy Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy developer, for $4.75 billion in cash, plus the assumption of the company\u2019s debt.\nThe acquisition, which was announced Monday, will help Alphabet expand its power-generation capacity alongside new data centers without having to rely on local utilities that are struggling to keep up with the demand of AI companies. Securing access to energy that powers data centers has become a critical part of training AI models.\nAlphabet previously held a minority stake in Intersect Power after Google and TPG Rise Climate led an $800 million strategic funding round in the company last December. That partnership set a target of $20 billion in total investment by 2030.\nThe acquisition includes Intersect\u2019s future development projects but excludes its existing operation, which will be bought out by other investors and managed as a separate company.\nIntersect\u2019s new data parks, which are essentially locations next to wind, solar, and battery power, are expected to be operational late next year and fully completed by 2027, Google said when it announced its minority investment.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of next year.\nGoogle will be the primary user. However, Intersect\u2019s campuses are designed as industrial parks that can host other companies\u2019 AI chips alongside Google\u2019s.\n\ntitle2:\nUber and Lyft to test Baidu robotaxis in London next year, joining Waymo\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nUber and Lyft will start testing Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go robotaxis in London in 2026, joining Waymo and local startup Wayve as companies that will have autonomous vehicles in the city next year.\nLyft CEO David Risher said in a post on X and LinkedIn that Lyft will start testing once it receives local regulatory approval. His company \u201cplans to scale to hundreds\u201d of Baidu\u2019s electric RT6 SUVs from there, though he did not lay out a timeline for commercial launch.\nUber announced it plans to test the vehicles there next year as part of its own deal with Baidu, which the companies announced in July. The company said it expects to start testing in the first half of 2026.\nThe twin London rollouts are the latest in a series of robotaxi tie-ups that have seen Uber and Lyft strike deals with Baidu, Waymo, and many others in order to stand up operations in cities around the world.\n\ntitle3:\nChatGPT launches a year-end review like Spotify Wrapped\ndescription3:\nChatGPT is releasing its own version of Spotify Wrapped. That is, the OpenAI-owned chatbot is now rolling out an annual review feature called \u201cYour Year with ChatGPT\u201d to eligible consumers in select markets, including the United States.\nOther English-speaking markets with access to the new offering include Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.\nAt launch, the feature will be offered to those with the free, Plus, and Pro plans who have the \u201creference saved memories\u201d and \u201creference chat history\u201d options turned on and have met a minimum conversation activity threshold, the company told TechCrunch via email.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nTeam, Enterprise, or Education accounts will not be able to use the \u201cYour Year with ChatGPT\u201d feature. In addition, the experience is meant to be \u201clightweight, privacy-forward, and user-controlled,\u201d the company noted.\nSimilar to other annual reviews offered by consumer apps, \u201cYour Year with ChatGPT\u201d takes inspiration from the popular year-end look back, Spotify Wrapped. Like Spotify\u2019s feature, OpenAI uses catchy graphics and personalizes the experience to the individual by giving out \u201cawards\u201d based on how you\u2019ve used ChatGPT throughout the year.\nFor instance, you might be awarded with the \u201cCreative Debugger\u201d if you used the chatbot to come up with solutions to a problem or worked through a concept or idea.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nThe app also creates a poem and an image about your year focused on your topics of interest. (We\u2019re wondering how this will look next year as ChatGPT embraces adult content in 2026.)\nWhile the year-end wrap-up will be promoted on the ChatGPT app\u2019s home screen, it won\u2019t be forced on users or opened automatically.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nIt will be available on the ChatGPT web app and mobile app for iOS and Android, the company says.\nYou also can ask ChatGPT directly for \u201cYour Year with ChatGPT\u201d to trigger the experience.\n\ntitle4:\nParamount renews bid for Warner Bros, ensuring $40B Larry Ellison backing\ndescription4:\nThe war for the future of Warner Brothers continues, as Paramount Skydance announced Monday an amended all-cash offer for the legacy movie studio. The offer includes an \u201cirrevocable personal guarantee\u201d from a major backer, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, to provide tens of billions in equity financing for the deal. It\u2019s the latest move by Ellison\u2019s son, David Ellison \u2014 the CEO of Paramount Skydance \u2014 to pry the potential acquisition loose from his competition, the streaming giant Netflix.\n\u201cLarry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\u201d a Paramount press release published Monday states. The proposed equity financing had previously been included in Paramount\u2019s offer, but the elder Ellison\u2019s \u201cpersonal guarantee\u201d is new, the press release states.\nThe revamped offer comes a mere week after the WBD board rejected Paramount\u2019s initial bid, favoring, instead, a previous deal with Netflix. That deal was announced on December 5, outlining how the streamer would purchase the movie studio via a cash and stock option valued at $27.75 per WBD share, and a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion.\nThree days after the Netflix deal was announced, Paramount launched a hostile bid valued at $108.4 billion, offering $30 per share. The WBD board rejected this offer, calling it \u201cillusory\u201d and claiming that Paramount had misled shareholders about the proposed deal\u2019s financing. At the time of the rejection, the board noted that the deal with Netflix was \u201ca binding agreement with enforceable commitments, with no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments.\u201d\nNow, Paramount\u2019s amended offer has been designed to \u201caddress WBD\u2019s stated concerns regarding Paramount\u2019s superior offer,\u201d Paramount said. In October, CNBC reported that, prior to the Netflix deal, WBD had previously rejected three different takeover offers from Paramount.\n\u201cParamount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD,\u201d said Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, in Monday\u2019s press release. \u201cOur $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders. Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe expect the board of directors of WBD to take the necessary steps to secure this value-enhancing transaction and preserve and strengthen an iconic Hollywood treasure for the future.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
