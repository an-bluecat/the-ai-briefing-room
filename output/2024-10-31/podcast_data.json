Amazon's overall third-quarter sales were $158.9 billion, ahead of analysts' estimates of $157.2 billion.\nAmazon's online advertising business is still a fraction of the company's overall business, but its growth over the years has made it a major competitor to Alphabet and Meta , which lead the digital advertising market. Alphabet's Google currently represents 27.7% of the worldwide digital advertising market, followed by Meta at 22.8% and Amazon with 8.8%, according to data provided to CNBC by Emarketer.\nMeta's third-quarter advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion, which was up 19% compared with the year prior. That was slightly ahead of analysts' expectations of $39.49 billion, according to StreetAccount. Ads accounted for 98.3% of Meta's overall third-quarter revenue.\nAlphabet generated $65.85 billion in third-quarter ad revenue, the company reported Tuesday. That was up 10% from $59.65 billion the year prior. Additionally, advertising sales for the company's YouTube unit rose 12% year over year to $8.92 billion.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT search, competing with Google and Microsoft\ndescription1:\nIn this article GOOGL\nMSFT Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nIn this photo illustration, the OpenAI logo is displayed on a mobile phone screen with a photo of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Didem Mente | Anadolu | Getty Images\nOpenAI on Thursday launched a search feature within ChatGPT, its viral chatbot, that positions the high-powered artificial intelligence startup to better compete with search engines like Google , Microsoft 's Bing and Perplexity. ChatGPT search offers up-to-the-minute sports scores, stock quotes, news, weather and more, powered by real-time web search and partnerships with news and data providers, according to the company. It began beta-testing the search engine, called SearchGPT, in July. The release could have implications for Google as the dominant search engine. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online. Shares of Alphabet were down about 1% following the news.\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards OpenAI's ChatGPT search OpenAI\nThe move also positions OpenAI as more of a competitor to Microsoft and its businesses. Microsoft has invested close to $14 billion in OpenAI, yet OpenAI's products directly compete with Microsoft's AI and search tools, such as Copilot and Bing. In a Reddit AMA Thursday, OpenAI's engineering VP, Srinivas Narayanan, answered a user question about whether ChatGPT search used Bing as the search engine behind the scenes, writing, \"We use a set of services and Bing is an important one.\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X that search is his \"favorite feature we have launched\" in ChatGPT since the chatbot's original debut. OpenAI says users can \"search in a more natural, intuitive way\" and ask follow-up questions \"just like you would in a conversation.\" The search model is a fine-tuned version of OpenAI's most powerful AI model yet, GPT-4o, and is fueled in part by third-party search providers and content provided by news industry partners. \"I find it to be a way faster/easier way to get the information I'm looking for,\" Altman said Thursday during the Reddit AMA. \"I think we'll see this especially for queries that require more complex research. I also look forward to a future where a search query can dynamically render a custom web page in response!\" OpenAI wrote in a Thursday blog post that it used feedback from its SearchGPT prototype to build out the feature and that it plans to \"keep improving search, particularly in areas like shopping and travel, and leverage the reasoning capabilities of the OpenAI o1 series to do deeper research.\" ChatGPT will \"automatically search the web based on what you ask,\" according to an OpenAI blog post. Users can manually click the web search icon within ChatGPT to search if they choose. Chats now include links to sources like articles or blog posts, which users can access by clicking the \"Sources\" button below the response to open a sidebar. OpenAI said it collaborated with its news partners, including The Associated Press, Reuters, Axel Springer, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Hearst, Dotdash Meredith, the Financial Times, News Corp., Le Monde, The Atlantic, Time and Vox Media.\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards OpenAI's ChatGPT search OpenAI\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon (AMZN) Q3 earnings report 2024\ndescription2:\nAmazon reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the third quarter, driven by growth in its cloud computing and advertising businesses. The stock ticked about 5% higher in extended trading.\nHere are the results.\nEarnings: $1.43 vs $1.14 per share expected by LSEG\n$1.43 vs $1.14 per share expected by LSEG Revenue: $158.88 billion vs $157.2 billion expected by LSEG\nWall Street is also watching several other numbers in the report:\nAmazon Web Services: $27.4 billion vs. $27.5 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n$27.4 billion vs. $27.5 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Advertising: $14.3 billion vs. $14.3 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\nIn cloud, Amazon Web Services revenue was a hair below consensus estimates, but it's growing faster than the same period last year. Sales grew 19% during the quarter compared to a year ago when sales accelerated by 12%. The company was navigating slowing growth in its cloud business last year as customers trimmed their budgets due to heightened economic concerns.\nAWS is still growing slower than its top challengers. Revenue from Azure and other cloud services at Microsoft came in at 33%, and Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue increased nearly 35%.\nAmazon's capital expenditures surged 81% year-over-year from $12.48 billion to $22.62 billion as it continues to invest in data centers and equipment like Nvidia GPUs to power its artificial intelligence products. Amazon has launched several AI products in its cloud and e-commerce businesses, and it's also expected to announce a new version of its Alexa voice assistant powered by generative AI. The company's chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call that the majority of the company's 2024 capex spending is to support the growing need for technology infrastructure.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said the company plans to spend about $75 billion on capex in 2024 and that he suspects the company will spend more in 2025. \"The increase bumps here are really driven by generative AI,\" Jassy said during a call with analysts.\n\"It is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,\" he said, noting that shareholders \"will feel good about this long term, that we're aggressively pursuing it.\"\nAdvertising was another bright spot in the report. Sales in the unit expanded 19% year over year to $14.3 billion during the quarter, outpacing growth in Amazon's core retail business.\nAmazon and Apple , which also reported quarterly results on Thursday, round out a busy week of earnings for the top tech companies. Alphabet on Tuesday reported better-than-expected results, driven by cloud growth. Microsoft issued disappointing guidance on Wednesday, leading to the stock's steepest selloff in two years, while Meta beat estimates but warned of significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses next year.\nAmong online ad companies, Amazon showed the strongest growth, although its ad business still remains a fraction the size of juggernauts Meta and Google. Meta's advertising revenue grew 18.7% year over year, while Google's advertising business increased 15% in the quarter. Snap 's sales jumped 15% from a year earlier.\nAmazon forecast revenue in the current quarter to be between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion, which would represent growth of 7% to 11% year over year. The midpoint of that range, $185 billion, fell short of the average analyst estimate of $186.2 billion, according to LSEG.\nOperating income during the third quarter grew 56% year over year to $17.4 billion, showing that Amazon's focus on efficiency and continued cost-cutting continues to lift the bottom line. Jassy has been laser-focused on trimming expenses across the company, cutting more than 27,000 jobs since the beginning of 2022. Amazon has continued to restructure its teams this year.\nWall Street has applauded Jassy's campaign to rein in expenses, with Amazon shares up about 23% year to date. The Nasdaq has gained roughly 27% over the same stretch.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta's Threads app now has 275 million users, Zuckerberg says\ndescription3:\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg holds a smartphone, as he makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S. September 25, 2024.\nThreads, Meta 's rival to Elon Musk's X app, now has nearly 275 million monthly users, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday.\n\"We continue to be on track towards this becoming our next major social app,\" Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts, adding that he was \"quite pleased\" with the trajectory of the app.\nThe latest numbers indicate Threads is up 175% from a year ago when it reached 100 million users. The app is also up from 200 million monthly actives since Meta's second-quarter report in July. The app is now signing up more than 1 million users per day, Zuckerberg also said on Wednesday.\nThreads launched in July 2023 as a rival to Musk-owned X, who closed a deal to purchase the social app formerly known as Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion.\nX remains ahead of Threads in terms of users, but not by much. Musk's social media app now has roughly 318 million monthly users, according to an estimate by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. That's down 24% since Musk completed his acquisition of the company in October 2022, according to Sensor Tower.\nThreads could provide Meta more places to deliver ads to users. Ads accounted for 98.3% of Meta's total revenue in the third quarter.\n\"Specifically, as it pertains to monetization, we don't expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue at this time,\" said CFO Susan Li on the earnings call. \"We've been just pleased with the growth trajectory and again, are really focused on introducing features that the community finds valuable.\"\nAnalysts at Bernstein wrote on Wednesday that Threads' growth provides a lot to get excited about.\n\"Even though Meta does not expect Threads to be a meaningful driver of 2025 revenue, we expect ads to show up and scale on Threads next year,\" the Bernstein analysts wrote.\nAcross Meta's family of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram and its other consumer-facing platforms, the company said its daily active people grew 5% year-over-year to reach 3.29 billion. That figure came in below analysts' expectations of 3.31 billion.\nMeta shares closed down 4% on Thursday.\n\"We're very focused on continuing to build out the sort of functionality of Threads over time and being responsive to what users tell us that they're interested in,\" Li said.\nWATCH: Meta already benefitting from AI but Microsoft still 'needs to find gold,' says DA Davidson's Luria\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft stock has worst day in two years on disappointing forecast\ndescription4:\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at a company event on artificial intelligence technologies in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024.\nMicrosoft 's better-than-expected earnings report wasn't enough to prevent the stock's steepest sell-off in two years, as investors instead focused on the company's forecast for the current period.\nMicrosoft shares fell 6% on Thursday and headed for their worst day since Oct. 26, 2022, when they dropped 7.7%. That was a month before the public release of ChatGPT from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, a launch that set the stage for a boom in artificial intelligence investments.\nFor the period ending in December, Microsoft called for revenue in the range of $68.1 billion to $69.1 billion, implying 10.6% growth at the middle of the range. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $69.83 billion in revenue.\nRevenue in Microsoft's cloud infrastructure business, Azure, increased 33%. CFO Amy Hood said on a call with analysts that growth, in constant currency, will come in at 31% to 32% in the fiscal second quarter.\nOn Tuesday, Google reported 35% annual growth in its rival cloud business to $11.35 billion. Amazon , which leads the cloud infrastructure market, is scheduled to report results after the close on Thursday.\n\"We view Q1 results as solid across the core Azure and Office growth businesses, though tempered by a softer Q2 outlook,\" analysts at BofA Global Research wrote in a report on Thursday. They still recommend buying the stock.\nFiscal first-quarter revenue increased 16% from a year earlier to $65.59 billion, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $64.51 billion, according to LSEG. Earnings per share of $3.30 topped the $3.10 average estimate.\nNet income rose 11% to $24.67 billion from $22.29 billion in the year-ago quarter.\"\n\nResponse:",
