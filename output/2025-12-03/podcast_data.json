Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

This year it\u2019s all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days.\nAWS re:Invent 2025, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the \u201ctrue value\u201d of AI.\n\u201cAI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,\u201d he said during the December 2 keynote. \u201cThis is where we\u2019re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.\u201d\nOn December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe.\n\u201cWe are living in times of great change,\u201d Sivasubramanian said during the talk. \u201cFor the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.\u201d\nWhile AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.\nDoubling down on LLMs\nAWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own models. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier.\nFor instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.\nAWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAndy Jassy shares some numbers\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman\u2019s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is already bringing in loads of cash.\nHis comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product.\nDatabase savings arrives\nTucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts.\nSpecifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.\nCorey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well in his blog post, \u201cSix years of complaining finally pays off.\u201d\nCan\u2019t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes\nIs there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year\u2019s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+ to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.\nAn AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility\nAWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.\nAWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nExpanded AgentCore capabilities\nAWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.\nAWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.\nA nonstop AI agent worker bee\nAWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called \u201cFrontier agents,\u201d including one called \u201cKiro autonomous agent\u201d that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.\nAnother of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.\nNew Nova models and services\nAWS is rolling out four new AI models within its Nova AI model family \u2014 three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.\nThe company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS\u2019s big pitch is flexibility and customization.\nLyft\u2019s argument for AI agents\nThe ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that piped up during the event to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic\u2019s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues.\nThe company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year.\nAn AI Factory for the private data center\nAmazon also announced \u201cAI Factories\u201d that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.\nThe system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia\u2019s tech and AWS\u2019s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon\u2019s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon\u2019s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

These startups can request free credits for up to 100 users.\nBut there are restrictions. Only startups that have secured VC funding ranging from pre-seed to Series B funding are eligible. U.S.-based startups are eligible, but the offer is not available in every country. Geographic restrictions include France, Germany, and Italy, much of South America, and, naturally, trade-sanctioned countries. In addition, applications must be received by December 31.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.\n\ntitle3:\nNew unicorn Brevo raises $583M to challenge CRM giants\ndescription3:\nBrevo, a customer relationship management company headquartered in Paris, is now a unicorn \u2014 a startup valued at more than $1 billion. The startup raised \u20ac500 million in fresh equity funding ($583 million), which will fund its efforts to compete with larger players such as Hubspot and Salesforce not just in Europe, but also on their home turf in the U.S.\nFormerly known as Sendinblue, Brevo started out in 2012 as an email marketing solution for small businesses. The company expanded into mid-market and repositioned itself with a new name reflecting its broader product scope. That move paid off. Brevo now has more than 600,000 customers, ranging from small business owners to larger clients such as Carrefour, eBay, and H&M.\nThe U.S. currently represents 15% of Brevo\u2019s revenue \u2014 one of its three largest markets along with France and Germany. That\u2019s not enough for CEO Armand Thiberge, who is planning to spend some of the funding on U.S. growth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s 50% of the global market, so it should be 50% of our revenue,\u201d the French entrepreneur told TechCrunch.\nRevenue split concerns aside, the numbers are trending upwards.\nAfter joining the centaur club in 2023 when it surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, Brevo has now ticked its goal to surpass \u20ac200 million in ARR in 2025 ahead of time, and aims to reach \u20ac1 billion in 2030, Thiberge revealed to TechCrunch.\nThat\u2019s still far behind Salesforce, which is now targeting $41.55 billion in revenue for 2026. The French company hopes being a unicorn will help boost its notoriety, thanks to the status itself, and also to the equity funding, which comes in addition to debt that Brevo had previously secured.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThese coffers have already supported Brevo\u2019s plans to invest \u20ac50 million in AI over five years, and to use acquisitions (11 to date) as one of its growth levers. The 1,000-employee company now intends to use its new funding to support these two endeavors, alongside its push in the U.S., on which it plans to spend over \u20ac100 million, according to a press release.\nBrevo didn\u2019t disclose the exact valuation resulting from its latest round. It did give more details on its updated cap table.\nRumors had described the deal as Brevo getting acquired, but Thiberge said Brevo\u2019s management and employees still hold the largest share (26%) while new entrants General Atlantic and Oakley Capital each bought 25%; existing investors Bpifrance and Bridgepoint retained 24% each, while Series A lead Partech completed its exit.\nThis makes for a global cap table that mirrors Brevo\u2019s stated ambition to \u201cbuild a global European CRM leader capable of competing with U.S. players through product excellence.\u201d In other words, not through playing the European sovereignty card.\nFor Thiberge, \u201cwhoever has the best product wins, and it\u2019s a race to see who can make the product that is both the most complete and the easiest to use.\u201d There\u2019s an inherent tension to doing this, and to catering both to mid-market companies and very small businesses. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy every day [\u2026] but for us, this combination has been incredibly successful.\u201d\nTo serve this diverse audience, Brevo has significantly expanded beyond its email marketing roots. While it still competes with Mailchimp in that space, the company now offers an all-in-one platform with marketing automation, CRM, customer data management, and communication across email, SMS, WhatsApp, live chat, push notifications, and even integrated sales calls.\nThese functionalities are also increasingly boosted by AI, either through integrations or in-house. Expanding this feature set is one driver of Brevo\u2019s M&A strategy, but inorganic growth from buying competitors in key markets is the other. With acquisitions expected to contribute 45% of its \u20ac1 billion revenue target for 2030, the company\u2019s shopping list should be extensive.\n\ntitle4:\nAndy Jassy says Amazon's Nvidia competitor chip is already a multibillion-dollar business\ndescription4:\nCan any company, big or small, really topple Nvidia\u2019s AI chip dominance? Maybe not. But there are hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for those who can even peel off a chunk of it for themselves, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this week.\nAs expected, the company revealed at the AWS re:Invent conference the next generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip, Trainium3, which is 4x faster yet uses less power than the current Trainium2. Jassy revealed a few tidbits about the current Trainium in a post on X that shows why the company is so bullish on the chip.\nHe said the Trainium2 business \u201chas substantial traction, is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run-rate business, has 1M+ chips in production, and 100K+ companies using it as the majority of Bedrock usage today.\u201d\nBedrock is Amazon\u2019s AI app development tool that allows companies to pick and choose among many AI models.\nJassy said Amazon\u2019s AI chip is winning among the company\u2019s enormous roster of cloud customers because it \u201chas price-performance advantages over other GPU options that are compelling.\u201d In other words, he believes it works better and costs less than those \u201cother GPUs\u201d out there on the market.\nThat is, of course, Amazon\u2019s classic MO, offering its own homegrown tech at lower prices.\nAdditionally, AWS CEO Matt Garman offered even more insight in an interview with CRN, about one customer responsible for a big chunk of those billions in revenue: No shock here, it\u2019s Anthropic.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some enormous traction from Trainium2, particularly from our partners at Anthropic who we\u2019ve announced Project Rainier, where there\u2019s over 500,000 Trainium2 chips helping them build the next generations of models for Claude,\u201d Garman said.\nProject Rainier is Amazon\u2019s most ambitious AI cluster of servers, spread across multiple data centers in the U.S. and built to serve Anthropic\u2019s skyrocketing needs. It came online in October. Amazon is, of course, a major investor in Anthropic. In exchange, Anthropic made AWS its primary model training partner, even though Anthropic is now also offered on Microsoft\u2019s cloud via Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nOpenAI is now also using AWS in addition to Microsoft\u2019s cloud. But the OpenAI partnership couldn\u2019t have contributed much to Trainium\u2019s revenue because AWS is running it on Nvidia chips and systems, the cloud giant said.\nIndeed, only a few U.S. companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta have all the engineering pieces \u2014 silicon chip design expertise, homegrown high-speed interconnect. and networking technology \u2014 to even attempt true competition with Nvidia. (Remember, Nvidia cornered the market on one major high-performance networking tech in 2019 when CEO Jensen Huang outbid Intel and Microsoft to buy InfiniBand hardware maker Mellanox.)\nOn top of that, AI models and software built to be served up by Nvidia\u2019s chips also rely on Nvidia\u2019s proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software. CUDA allows the apps to use the GPUs for parallel processing compute, among other tasks. Just like the Intel versus SPARC chip war of yesterday, it\u2019s no small thing to rewrite an AI app for a non-CUDA chip.\nStill, Amazon may have a plan for that. As we previously reported, the next generation of its AI chip, Trainium4, will be built to interoperate with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs in the same system. Whether that helps peel more business away from Nvidia or simply reinforces its dominance, but on AWS\u2019s cloud, remains to be seen.\nIt may not matter to Amazon. If it is already on track to make multibillion dollars from the Trainium2 chip, and the next generation will be that much better, it may be winner enough.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.
