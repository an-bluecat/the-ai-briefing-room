Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday June 24), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla's robotaxis have already caught the attention of federal safety regulators\ndescription0:\nFederal safety regulators have reached out to Tesla a day after the automaker began providing rides in its branded robotaxis in Austin.\nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) contacted Tesla after numerous videos posted online appear to show Tesla robotaxis violating traffic laws in South Austin, where the company is providing rides to invited customers. Bloomberg was the first to report that the NHTSA reached out to Tesla. The NHTSA confirmed to TechCrunch that it has contacted the automaker.\n\u201cNHTSA is aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \u201cNHTSA will continue to enforce the law on all manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment, in accordance with the Vehicle Safety Act and our data-driven, risk-based investigative process. Under U.S. law, NHTSA does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems \u2014 rather, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets NHTSA\u2019s rigorous safety standards, and the agency investigates incidents involving potential safety defects. Following an assessment of those reports and other relevant information, NHTSA will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Tesla began giving paid rides to invited customers in South Austin. The launch, while limited in size and scope, is the first real test of the automaker\u2019s autonomous vehicle technology. Tesla does sell its branded Full Self-Driving Supervised software to owners of its vehicles. FSD handles steering and braking when engaged. However, it is considered an advanced driver-assistance system that requires the driver to have their hands on the wheel.\nTesla robotaxis are equipped with an unsupervised version of FSD, although the company has not provided specific details about this software. The robotaxis, which customers can hail via an app, are meant to drive on their own. Notably, Tesla robotaxis have a human \u201csafety monitor\u201d sitting in the front passenger seat during these rides.\nVideos posted online show the Tesla robotaxis driving over the speed limit and in one case, swerving into the wrong lane.\nTechCrunch reported Sunday that Ed Niedermeyer, author of \u201cLudicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors,\u201d who is in Austin to monitor the robotaxi rollout, took video showing a Tesla branded robotaxi suddenly hitting its brakes on two occasions without reason. A video, which TechCrunch has viewed and has since been posted on YouTube, shows that in both instances the Tesla hit the brakes as it approached police vehicles that were located in parking lot driveways adjacent to the roadway.\n\ntitle1:\nFour months after a $3B valuation, Harvey AI grows to $5B\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nHarvey AI, a startup that provides automation for legal work, has raised $300 million in Series E funding at a $5 billion valuation, the company told Fortune. The round was co-led by Kleiner Perkins and Coatue, with participation from existing investors, including Conviction, Elad Gil, OpenAI Startup Fund, and Sequoia.\nThe financing comes just four months after Harvey announced that Sequoia led a $300 million Series D round at a $3 billion valuation.\nWhile many AI companies aim to keep headcount low, Harvey is rapidly expanding its staff. The 3-year-old startup already employs 340 people and plans to double that number with its fresh funds, Fortune reported. Some of the new staff will be hired to help Harvey build AI products for professional services beyond legal, including tax accounting. The company\u2019s AI solutions, which assist lawyers in reviewing documents and drafting contracts, are used by 337 legal clients.\nHarvey has been growing at a rapid clip, reaching an annualized run-rate revenue of $75 million in April, up from $50 million earlier in the year, Reuters reported last month.\nSome of Harvey\u2019s competitors include older legal startups, such as 10-year-old Ironclad and 17-year-old Clio, which raised a $300 million round at a $3 billion valuation last year.\n\ntitle2:\nDatabricks, Perplexity co-founder pledges $100M on new fund for AI researchers\ndescription2:\nAndy Konwinski, computer scientist and co-founder of Databricks and Perplexity, announced Monday that his company, Laude, is forming a new AI research institute backed with $100 million of his own money.\nThe Laude Institute functions less as an AI research lab and more like a fund looking to make investments structured similar to grants. In addition to Konwinski, the institute\u2019s board includes UC Berkeley professor Dave Patterson (known for a string of award-winning research), Jeff Dean (known as Google\u2019s chief scientist), and Joelle Pineau (Meta\u2019s vice president of AI Research).\nKonwinski announced the institute\u2019s first and \u201cflagship\u201d grant of $3 million annually for five years, which will anchor the new AI Systems Lab at UC Berkeley. This is a new lab led by one of Berkeley\u2019s most celebrated researchers, Ion Stoica, current director of the Sky Computing Lab. Stoica is also a co-founder of startup Anyscale (an AI and Python platform) and AI big data company Databricks, both built from tech developed in Berkeley\u2019s lab system.\nThe new AI Systems Lab is set to open in 2027 and in addition to Stoica will include a number of other well-known researchers.\nIn his blog post announcing the institute, Konwinski described its mission as \u201dbuilt by and for computer science researchers \u2026 We exist to catalyze work that doesn\u2019t just push the field forward but guides it towards more beneficial outcomes.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a direct dig at OpenAI, which started out as an AI research facility and is now, arguably, consumed by its enormous commercial side. But other researchers have fallen prey to the lure of money as well.\nFor instance, popular AI researcher Epoch faced controversy when it revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks that was then used to unveil its new o3 model. Epoch\u2019s founder also launched a startup with the controversial mission to replace all human workers everywhere with AI agents.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Join visionaries from Precursor Ventures, NEA, Index Ventures, Underscore VC, and beyond for a day packed with strategies, workshops, and meaningful connections. Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nLike other AI research organizations with commercial ambitions, Konwinski has structured his institute across boundaries: as a nonprofit with a public benefit corporation operating arm.\nHe\u2019s dividing his research investments into two buckets that he calls \u201cSlingshots and Moonshots.\u201d Slingshots are for early-stage research that can benefit from grants and hands-on help. Moonshots are, as the name implies, for \u201clong-horizon labs tackling species-level challenges like AI for scientific discovery, civic discourse, healthcare, and workforce re-skilling.\u201d\nHis lab has, for instance, collaborated with \u201cterminal-bench,\u201d a Stanford-led benchmark for how well AI agents handle tasks, used by Anthropic.\nOne thing to note, Konwinski\u2019s endeavors under the name \u201cLaude\u201d aren\u2019t solely a grant-writing research institute. He also co-founded a for-profit venture fund launched in 2024. The fund\u2019s co-founder is former NEA VC Pete Sonsini, and a Laude spokesperson tells us it has more than 50 leading researchers as LPs in the fund. As TechCrunch previously reported, Laude led a $12 million investment in AI agent infrastructure startup Arcade. It has quietly backed other startups, too.\nA Laude spokesperson tells us that while Konwinski has pledged $100 million, he\u2019s also looking for, and open to, investment from other successful technologists. As to how Konwinski amassed a fortune big enough to guarantee $100 million for this new endeavor: Databricks closed a $15.3 billion funding round in January that valued the company at $62 billion. Perplexity last month secured a $14 billion valuation, too.\nDoes the world really need yet more AI \u201cgood for humanity\u201d research or another AI company with a murky nonprofit/commercial structure? No, and yes.\nAI research has become increasingly muddled. For instance, AI benchmarks designed to prove that a particular vendor\u2019s model works best have become plentiful these days. (Even Salesforce has its own LLM benchmark for CRMs.)\nAn alliance that includes the likes of Konwinski, Dean, and Stoica supporting truly independent research that could one day turn into independent and human-helpful commerce could be an attractive alternative.\nNote: This story was updated to reflect more details shared about the Laude VC fund.\n\ntitle3:\nCanada says telcos were breached in China-linked espionage hacks\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nThe Canadian government and the FBI say they are aware of malicious activity targeting telecommunication companies across Canada, attributing the intrusions to the China-backed hacking group Salt Typhoon.\nIn a joint advisory out late Friday, the feds said at least one unnamed Canadian telco was hacked in mid-February this year, in which hackers manipulated three Cisco-made routers to allow stealthy traffic collection from its network.\nThe feds say that separate investigations suggest that Salt Typhoon\u2019s targeting is \u201cbroader than just the telecommunications sector.\u201d\nSalt Typhoon, active since at least late 2024, previously targeted U.S. phone giants and internet providers, and more recently datacenter hosts, as part of a broad espionage campaign aimed at collecting intelligence on senior U.S. government officials. Salt Typhoon is one of several China-linked hacking groups thought to be preparing for China to launch a potential future invasion of Taiwan by 2027.\nThe Canadian-FBI joint advisory said the hackers will \u201calmost certainly\u201d persist in targeting Canadian organizations \u201cover the next two years.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nCourt filings reveal OpenAI and io's early work on an AI device\ndescription4:\nLegal filings submitted earlier this month from lawyers representing OpenAI and Jony Ive\u2019s io reveal new details about the companies\u2019 efforts to build a mass-market AI hardware device.\nThe filings are part of a trademark dispute lawsuit filed this month by iyO, a Google-backed hardware startup developing custom-molded earpieces that connect to other devices. Over the weekend, OpenAI pulled promotional materials related to its $6.5 billion acquisition of Jony Ive\u2019s io startup in order to comply with a court order involved in the suit. OpenAI says it\u2019s fighting iyO\u2019s allegations of trademark infringement.\nFor the last year, OpenAI executives and former Apple leaders now working at io have vigorously researched in-ear hardware devices, according to filings submitted in iyO\u2019s lawsuit. In a June 12 filing, lawyers representing OpenAI and io said the companies purchased at least 30 headphone sets from various companies to explore what\u2019s on the market today. In recent months, OpenAI and io executives also met with iyO\u2019s leadership and demoed their in-ear technology, according to emails revealed in the case.\nThat said, OpenAI\u2019s first device in collaboration with io may not be a pair of headphones at all.\nTang Tan, a longtime Apple executive who co-founded io and serves as the startup\u2019s chief hardware officer, claims in a declaration to the court that the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io\u2019s launch video \u201cis not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.\u201d Tan notes that the design of said prototype in not yet finalized and that the product is at least a year away from being advertised or offered for sale.\nThe form factor of OpenAI and io\u2019s first hardware device has largely remained a mystery. Altman merely stated in io\u2019s launch video that the startup was working to create a \u201cfamily\u201d of AI devices with various capabilities, and Ive said io\u2019s first prototype \u201ccompletely captured\u201d his imagination.\nAltman had previously told OpenAI\u2019s employees at a meeting that the company\u2019s prototype, when finished, would be able to fit in a pocket or sit on a desk, according to the Wall Street Journal. The OpenAI CEO reportedly said the device would be fully aware of a user\u2019s surroundings and that it would be a \u201cthird device\u201d for consumers to use alongside their smartphone and laptop.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cOur intent with this collaboration was, and is, to create products that go beyond traditional products and interfaces,\u201d said Altman in a declaration to the court submitted on June 12.\nLawyers representing OpenAI also said in a filing that the company has explored a wide range of devices, including ones that were \u201cdesktop-based and mobile, wireless and wired, wearable and portable.\u201d\nWhile smart glasses have emerged as the front-runner for AI-enabled devices, with companies like Meta and Google racing to develop the first broadly adopted pair, several companies are also exploring AI-enabled headphones. Apple is reportedly working on a pair of AirPods with cameras, which would help power AI features by gathering information about the surrounding environment.\nIn recent months, OpenAI and io executives have done considerable research into in-ear products.\nOn May 1, OpenAI\u2019s VP of Product, Peter Welinder, and Tan met with iyO\u2019s CEO, Jason Rugolo, to learn more about iyO\u2019s in-ear product, according to an emailed invitation revealed in the case. The meeting took place at io\u2019s office in Jackson Square, the San Francisco neighborhood where Ive has bought several buildings to work on LoveFrom and io.\nAt the meeting, Welinder and Tan tested out iyO\u2019s custom-fit earpiece but were disappointed when the product failed repeatedly during demonstrations, according to follow-up emails revealed in the case.\nTan claims in his declaration that he met with Rugolo as a courtesy to his mentor, longtime Apple executive Steve Zadesky, who recommended he take the meeting. Tan also claims he took several precautions to avoid learning too much about iyO\u2019s IP, such as suggesting that his lawyers review materials before he does.\nHowever, it seemed that OpenAI and io employees thought they could learn something from one of iyO\u2019s partners. To customize its in-ear headsets, iyO sent a specialist from an ear-scanning company, The Ear Project, to someone\u2019s home or office to get a detailed map of someone\u2019s ear.\nIn one email revealed in the case, Marwan Rammah, a former Apple engineer who\u2019s now working at io, told Tan that purchasing a large database of three-dimensional scans from The Ear Project could give the company a \u201chelpful starting point on ergonomics.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if any such deal took place.\nRugolo tried repeatedly to forge a deeper relationship between iyO, io, and OpenAI \u2014 but largely failed, according to the emails. He pitched OpenAI on launching iyO\u2019s device as an early \u201cdeveloper kit\u201d for its final AI device. He pitched OpenAI on investing in iyO and, at one point, even offered to sell his entire company for $200 million, the filings say. However, Tan said in his declaration that he declined these offers.\nEvans Hankey, former Apple executive turned io co-founder and chief product officer, said in a declaration to the court that io is not working on a \u201ccustom-molded earpiece product.\u201d\nThe ChatGPT maker seems to be more than a year out from selling its first hardware device, which may not be an in-ear product whatsoever. Given what the company said in this lawsuit, it appears it is also exploring other form factors.\"\n\nResponse:",
