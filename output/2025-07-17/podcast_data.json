Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

OpenAI says the agent can automatically navigate a user\u2019s calendar, generate editable presentations and slideshows, and run code.\nThe tool, called ChatGPT agent, combines several capabilities from OpenAI\u2019s previous agentic tools, including Operator\u2019s ability to click around on websites, as well as Deep Research\u2019s ability to synthesize information from dozens of websites into a concise research report. OpenAI says users will be able to interact with the agent simply by prompting ChatGPT in natural language.\nChatGPT agent is rolling out on Thursday to subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s Pro, Plus, and Team plans. To activate the tool, users can select \u201cagent mode\u201d in ChatGPT\u2019s dropdown menu of tools.\nChatGPT can now do work for you using its own computer.\nIntroducing ChatGPT agent\u2014a unified agentic system combining Operator\u2019s action-taking remote browser, deep research\u2019s web synthesis, and ChatGPT\u2019s conversational strengths. pic.twitter.com/7uN2Nc6nBQ \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) July 17, 2025\nThe launch of ChatGPT agent represents OpenAI\u2019s boldest attempt yet to turn ChatGPT into an agentic product that can take actions and offload tasks for users, rather than just answering questions. In recent years, Silicon Valley companies including OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have unveiled dozens of AI agents that have promised to do just that. However, these early version AI agents have proven to struggle with complex tasks, and they seem less compelling as products than the ultimate vision tech executives pitch around AI agents.\nThat said, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent is far more capable than its previous offerings.\nThe company\u2019s new agent can access ChatGPT connectors, allowing users to connect apps like Gmail and GitHub so that the agent can find relevant information to your prompts. OpenAI says ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal, and it can use APIs to access certain apps.\nOpenAI suggests that users can tap ChatGPT agent to \u201cplan and buy ingredients to make Japanese breakfast for four,\u201d as well as \u201canalyze three competitors and create a slide deck.\u201d These kinds of capabilities requires ChatGPT agent to parse through websites, plan a course of action, and use tools \u2014 much more complicated tasks than OpenAI has previously tried to tackle with agents.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe model underlying ChatGPT agent offers state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, according to OpenAI.\nThe company says the ChatGPT agent model scores 41.6% on Humanity\u2019s Last Exam (pass@1), a difficult test made up of thousands of questions across more than one hundred subjects. That\u2019s roughly double what OpenAI\u2019s o3 and o4-mini scored on the test.\nOn FrontierMath, one of the hardest known math benchmarks, OpenAI says ChatGPT agent scores 27.4% when it has access to tools, such as a terminal for code execution. The previous state-of-the-art score comes from o4-mini, which scored just 6.3%.\nOpenAI notes that it developed ChatGPT agent with safety in mind, largely because the product presents some newfound capabilities that could make it more dangerous in the hands of a bad actor. OpenAI has previously warned that agentic models could present more dangerous capabilities.\nIn a safety report for ChatGPT agent, OpenAI says it\u2019s designated the model as \u201chigh capability\u201d in biological and chemical weapon domains, which is defined in OpenAI\u2019s Preparedness Framework as a model with the ability to \u201camplify existing pathways to severe harm.\u201d OpenAI notes that it does not have direct evidence of this, but it\u2019s decided to take a precautionary approach and activate new safeguards to mitigate these risks.\nThe new safeguards for ChatGPT agent include a monitor that works in real time as users interact with the product. OpenAI says it runs a classifier across every prompt entered into ChatGPT agent, determining whether the request is related to biology. If so, OpenAI runs ChatGPT agent\u2019s response through a second monitor that determines whether the content could be used to evoke a biological threat.\nOpenAI also says it disabled ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature for this agent to prevent misuse. In other parts of ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s memory feature allows the chatbot to reference information from previous user chats. However, OpenAI says bad actors could use the feature in ChatGPT agent to exfiltrate sensitive data through prompt injection attacks. The company says it may revisit adding the feature in the future, however.\nWhile ChatGPT agent sounds impressive, it remains to be seen how capable it truly is in the real world. Until now, agent technology has proven relatively brittle when interacting with the real world. That said, OpenAI says it\u2019s developed a more capable model that\u2019s able to deliver on the promise of AI agents.\nThis story was updated with more information.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft is buying tons of carbon removal from Xprize startup Vaulted Deep\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft is building data centers as fast as it can, and that\u2019s killing its carbon balance sheet. Since 2020, its carbon emissions have grown by nearly a quarter, undermining the pledge it made that year to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates by 2030.\nSo Microsoft has been buying massive amounts of carbon-removal credits to attempt to remedy that situation, including a newly announced purchase of 4.9 million metric tons from Vaulted Deep. Neither party disclosed the financial terms of the deal. It will last 12 years through 2038.\nVaulted Deep operates like a reverse oil company. It collects solid waste \u2014 like treated sewage, excess manure, or paper sludge \u2014 that would otherwise be headed for a landfill or incinerator, blends it into a slurry, and injects it into porous rocks deep underground. The wells are drilled and pores opened using technology developed for fracking oil and gas.\nSo far, Vaulted Deep has removed over 18,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The company was a runner-up in the Xprize Carbon competition, and it raised a $32 million Series A in November that was led by Prelude Ventures.\nRecently, Microsoft has been stuck between a rock and a hard place to make good on its imperiled carbon pledge. While the tech company has been investing heavily in renewable power \u2014 avoiding emissions is considered the appropriate first step \u2014 there are some things it must use, like semiconductors, for which there are no zero-greenhouse-gas alternatives.\nLast year, Microsoft generated 14.9 million metric tons\u2019 worth of greenhouse gas emissions, it said, more than double what it hopes to be producing in 2030, when it plans on reaching negative carbon emissions.\nTo hit its goal, the company has recently been ramping up its investments in carbon removal. Among them are a 7 million metric ton deal with Chestnut Carbon to reforest 60,000 acres in the southeastern U.S. and another for 3.7 million metric tons with CO280 to capture carbon from paper mill operations along the Gulf Coast.\n\ntitle2:\nSubstack raises $100M from Chernin Group, Andreessen Horowitz, Skims CEO, and more\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nSubstack announced on Thursday that it has raised $100 million in Series C funding led by investors at BOND and The Chernin Group (TCG). The round included participation from Andreessen Horowitz; Rich Paul, CEO and founder of Klutch Sports Group; and Jens Grede, CEO and co-founder of Skims.\nThe New York Times reports that the funding brings Substack\u2019s valuation to $1.1 billion, almost 70% higher than its 2021 valuation of $650 million.\nFounded in 2017, Substack has gained popularity as a platform for creators and publishers to monetize their content. The company said in March that it had surpassed 5 million paid subscriptions on its platform, up from 2 million in 2023.\nSubstack said in the blog post that it will use the funding to invest in \u201cbetter tools, broader reach, and deeper support for writers and creators.\u201d It also plans to invest in the Substack app.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta appoints generative AI VP to run Threads\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nMeta appointed Connor Hayes, Meta\u2019s VP of Product for Generative AI, to become the head of Threads, per Axios.\nUntil now, Instagram head Adam Mosseri has been in charge of Threads. But the platform has grown into more than a side product of Instagram, necessitating additional leadership.\nThough Threads only launched in 2023, its mobile daily active user (DAU) numbers are fast approaching those of X, according to market intelligence provider Similarweb. Currently, Threads is averaging around 115 million DAUs on mobile, with X\u2019s DAU numbers reaching around 132 million.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Meta for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nAnthropic tightens usage limits for Claude Code - without telling users\ndescription4:\nSince Monday morning, Claude Code users have been hit with unexpectedly restrictive usage limits. The problems, many of which have been aired on Claude Code\u2019s GitHub page, seem to be concentrated among heavy users of the service, many of whom are on the $200-a-month Max plan.\nUsers are only told \u201cClaude usage limit reached,\u201d and given a time (typically within a matter of hours) when the limit will reset. But with no explicit announcement of a change in limits, many users have concluded that their subscription has been downgraded or that their usage is being inaccurately tracked.\n\u201cYour tracking of usage limits has changed and is no longer accurate,\u201d one user complained. \u201cThere is no way in the 30 minutes of a few requests I have hit the 900 messages.\u201d\nWhen reached for comment, an Anthropic representative confirmed the issues but declined to elaborate further. \u201cWe\u2019re aware that some Claude Code users are experiencing slower response times,\u201d the representative said, \u201cand we\u2019re working to resolve these issues.\u201d\nThe change has been alarming for users, who received no advance notice of the changes and no guidance on what to expect going forward. One user, who asked not to be identified, said it has been impossible to advance his project since the usage limits came into effect. \u201cIt just stopped the ability to make progress,\u201d the user told TechCrunch. \u201cI tried Gemini and Kimi, but there\u2019s really nothing else that\u2019s competitive with the capability set of Claude Code right now.\u201d\nThese problems have emerged alongside broader issues within Anthropic\u2019s network. Many API users reported overload errors during the same period, and the company\u2019s status page shows six separate issues during the past four days. Notably, the network still shows 100% uptime for the week.\nWhile loading errors are commonplace, Anthropic\u2019s new approach to usage limits has caused significant confusion among users, many of whom were unaware they were subject to usage limits. Part of the confusion comes from Anthropic\u2019s pricing system, which sets tiered limits without ever guaranteeing a set level of access. The most expensive Max plan, priced at $200 a month, promises usage limits 20 times higher than a Pro subscription. The Pro plan, in turn, offers limits five times higher than the free plan. But Anthropic says the free user limit \u201cwill vary by demand\u201d and does not set an absolute value. The result leaves users unable to plan around usage limits, since they have no clear idea of when their service will be restricted.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe $200 Max plan has been particularly popular among heavy users of the service, with some viewing the plan as unsustainable for Anthropic in the long term. The user we spoke to said the plan often allows him to make over $1,000 worth of calls (measured in API pricing) in a single day. As a result, he wasn\u2019t surprised usage limits were becoming more restrictive \u2014 but hoped the company would communicate the changes more clearly.\n\u201cJust be transparent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lack of communication just causes people to lose confidence in them.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
