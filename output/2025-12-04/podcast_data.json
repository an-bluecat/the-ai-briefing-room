And the singular message, amid a deluge of product news and keynotes, was AI for the enterprise.\nThis year it was all about upgrades that give customers greater control to customize AI agents, including one that AWS claims can learn from you and then work independently for days. Amazon CTO Dr. Werner Vogels capped off the final night with a keynote aimed at lifting up developers and assuaging any fears at AI is coming for engineering jobs.\nAWS re:Invent 2025, which runs through December 5, started with a keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman, who leaned into the idea that AI agents can unlock the \u201ctrue value\u201d of AI.\n\u201cAI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,\u201d he said during the December 2 keynote. \u201cThis is where we\u2019re starting to see material business returns from your AI investments.\u201d\nOn December 3, the conference pressed on with its AI agents messaging, as well as deeper dives into customer stories. Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at AWS, gave one of the keynote talks. To say he was bullish is perhaps understating the vibe.\n\u201cWe are living in times of great change,\u201d Sivasubramanian said during the talk. \u201cFor the first time in history, we can describe what we want to accomplish in natural language, and agents generate the plan. They write the code, call the necessary tools, and execute the complete solution. Agents give you the freedom to build without limits, accelerating how quickly you can go from idea to impact in a big way.\u201d\nWhile AI agent news promises to be a persistent presence throughout AWS re:Invent 2025, there were other announcements, too. Here is a roundup of the ones that got our attention. TechCrunch will update this article, with the newest insights at the top, through the end of AWS re:Invent. Be sure to check back.\nWerner out \u2026\nAmazon CTO Werner Vogels had the closing keynote of the conference \u2014 and it looks like this will be his last one.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cThis is my final re:Invent keynote,\u201d he said, then quickly added he is not leaving the company. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Amazon or anything like that, but I think that after 14 re:Invents you guys are owed young, fresh, new voices.\u201d\nVogels then spent more than an hour talking to a packed room before ending with a \u201cWerner, out\u201d and a literal mic drop.\nWill AI take your job?\nVogels spent much of the closing keynote talking about AI and its role in the future, including the looming threat that it will take away jobs.\n\u201cWill AI take my job? Maybe,\u201d Vogels asked and answered, before noting that some tasks will be automated, and some skills will become obsolete. \u201cSo maybe we should rephrase and reframe this question. We will AI make me obsolete? Absolutely not, if you evolve.\u201d\nNext-gen CPU\nAWS unveiled its Graviton5 CPU on Thursday, the next-generation chip that the company promises will be its highest performing, most efficient yet. The Graviton5 contains 192 processor cores, a dense and efficient design that AWS says reduces the distance data must travel between cores. That helps cut inter-core communication latency by up to 33% while increasing bandwidth, the company said.\nDoubling down on LLMs\nAWS announced more tools for enterprise customers to create their own models. Specifically, AWS said it is adding new capabilities for both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI to make building custom LLMs easier.\nFor instance, AWS is bringing serverless model customization to SageMaker, which allows developers to start building a model without needing to think about compute resources or infrastructure. The serverless model customization can be accessed through either a self-guided path or by prompting an AI agent.\nAWS also announced Reinforcement Fine Tuning in Bedrock, which allows developers to choose a preset workflow or reward system and have Bedrock run their customization process automatically from start to finish.\nAndy Jassy shares some numbers\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy took to social media platform X to expound on AWS chief Matt Garman\u2019s keynote speech. The message: The current generation of its Nvidia-competitor AI chip Trainium2 is already bringing in loads of cash.\nHis comments were tied to the reveal of its next-generation chip, Trainium3, and meant to forecast a promising revenue future for the product.\nDatabase savings arrives\nTucked among the dozens of announcements is one item that is already getting cheers: Discounts.\nSpecifically, AWS said it was launching Database Savings Plans, which help customers reduce database costs by up to 35% when they commit to a consistent amount of usage ($/hour) over a one-year term. The company said the savings will automatically apply each hour to eligible usage across supported database services, and any additional usage beyond the commitment is billed at on-demand rates.\nCorey Quinn, chief cloud economist at Duckbill, summed it up well in his blog post, \u201cSix years of complaining finally pays off.\u201d\nCan\u2019t get a better deal than free, Amazon hopes\nIs there any way for another AI coding tool to win the hearts of startup founders? Amazon hopes a year\u2019s worth of credits, for free, will do the trick for its offering, Kiro. The company will be giving away credits to Kiro Pro+ to qualified startups that apply for the deal before the end of the month. However, only early-stage startups in certain countries are eligible.\nAn AI training chip and Nvidia compatibility\nAWS introduced a new version of its AI training chip called Trainium3 along with an AI system called UltraServer that runs it. The TL;DR: This upgraded chip comes with some impressive specs, including a promise of up to 4x performance gains for both AI training and inference while lowering energy use by 40%.\nAWS also provided a teaser. The company already has Trainium4 in development, which will be able to work with Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nExpanded AgentCore capabilities\nAWS announced new features in its AgentCore AI agent building platform. One feature of note is Policy in AgentCore, which gives developers the ability to more easily set boundaries for AI agents.\nAWS also announced that agents will now be able to log and remember things about their users. Plus it announced that it will help its customers evaluate agents through 13 prebuilt evaluation systems.\nA nonstop AI agent worker bee\nAWS announced three new AI agents (there is that term again) called \u201cFrontier agents,\u201d including one called \u201cKiro autonomous agent\u201d that writes code and is designed to learn how a team likes to work so it can operate largely on its own for hours or days.\nAnother of these new agents handles security processes like code reviews, and the third does DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.\nNew Nova models and services\nAWS is rolling out four new AI models within its Nova AI model family \u2014 three of which are text generating and one that can create text and images.\nThe company also announced a new service called Nova Forge that allows AWS cloud customers to access pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models that they can then top off by training on their own proprietary data. AWS\u2019s big pitch is flexibility and customization.\nLyft\u2019s argument for AI agents\nThe ride-hailing company was among many AWS customers that piped up during the event to share their success stories and evidence of how products affected their business. Lyft is using Anthropic\u2019s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to create an AI agent that handles driver and rider questions and issues.\nThe company said this AI agent has reduced average resolution time by 87%. Lyft also said it has seen a 70% increase in driver usage of the AI agent this year.\nAn AI Factory for the private data center\nAmazon also announced \u201cAI Factories\u201d that allow big corporations and governments to run AWS AI systems in their own data centers.\nThe system was designed in partnership with Nvidia and includes both Nvidia\u2019s tech and AWS\u2019s. While companies that use it can stock it with Nvidia GPUs, they can also opt for Amazon\u2019s newest homegrown AI chip, the Trainium3. The system is Amazon\u2019s way of addressing data sovereignty, or the need of governments and many companies to control their data and not share it, even to use AI.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta reportedly plans to slash Metaverse budget by up to 30%\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMeta may be planning to make serious cuts to its Metaverse division, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.\nCompany executives are mulling slashing the virtual reality platform\u2019s budget by up to 30%, the report said, adding that any reductions would also include layoffs.\nIf Meta does go ahead with such a plan, the move would reflect the overall lack of interest in products like Meta\u2019s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware \u2014 both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.\nSince Meta\u2019s rebrand in 2021, investors have been skeptical of the company\u2019s allocation of resources to Metaverse projects, which lose billions of dollars each quarter. The company\u2019s efforts in AI and smart glasses have been more successful, though investors still worry that its investment plans are too steep.\nMeta\u2019s shares rose, however, following this report.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle2:\nMicro1, a Scale AI competitor, touts crossing $100M ARR\ndescription2:\nMicro1\u2019s rapid climb over the past two years has pushed it into a cohort of AI companies scaling at breakneck speed. The three-year-old startup, which helps AI labs recruit and manage human experts for training data, started the year with roughly $7 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR).\nToday, it claims to have surpassed $100 million in ARR, founder and CEO Ali Ansari told TechCrunch. That figure is also more than double the revenue Micro1 reported in September when it announced its $35 million Series A at a $500 million valuation.\nAnsari, 24, said then that Micro1 works with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as Fortune 100 companies racing to improve large language models through post-training and reinforcement learning. Their demand for top-tier human data has fueled a fast-expanding market that Ansari believes will grow from $10-15 billion today to nearly $100 billion within two years.\nMicro1\u2019s rise, and that of larger competitors such as Mercor and Surge, accelerated after OpenAI and Google DeepMind reportedly cut ties with Scale AI following Meta\u2019s $14 billion investment in the vendor and its decision to hire Scale\u2019s CEO.\nWhile Micro1\u2019s ARR is growing fast, according to the founder, it hasn\u2019t yet matched its rivals: Mercor\u2019s more than $450 million, sources told TechCrunch, and Surge\u2019s reported $1.2 billion in 2024.\nAnsari attributes Micro1\u2019s growth to its ability to recruit and evaluate domain experts quickly. Like Mercor, Micro1 began as an AI recruiter called Zara, matching engineering talent with software roles before pivoting into the data-training market. That tool now interviews and vets applicants seeking expert roles on the platform.\nBeyond supplying expert-level data to leading AI labs, Ansari says two new segments, still barely visible today, are on track to reshape the economics of human data.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe first involves non-AI-native Fortune 1000 enterprises that will begin building AI agents for internal workflows, support operations, finance, and industry-specific tasks.\nDeveloping these agents requires systematic evaluation: testing frontier models, grading their output, choosing winners, fine-tuning them, and continuously validating performance in production. Ansari argues this cycle depends heavily on human experts evaluating AI behavior at scale.\nThe second is robotics pre-training, which requires high-quality, human-generated demonstrations of everyday physical tasks. Micro1 is already building what Ansari calls the world\u2019s largest robotics pre-training dataset, collecting demonstrations from hundreds of generalists recording object interactions in their homes. Robotics companies will need vast volumes of this data before their systems can reliably operate in homes and offices, he said.\n\u201cWe anticipate that a good portion of the product budgets at non-AI-native enterprises will go towards evals and human data, moving from 0% to at least 25% of product budgets,\u201d said the CEO, who founded Micro1 while at UC Berkeley. \u201cWe\u2019re also helping robotics labs create robotics data; these two areas will account for a massive share of that $100 billion-a-year market.\u201d\nEven as new markets emerge, Micro1\u2019s current growth still comes primarily from elite AI labs and AI-heavy enterprises. The startup is scaling its work with these labs on reinforcement learning, the feedback loop to test and improve model behavior.\nMicro1 hopes its early move into robotics data and enterprise agent development, in addition to scaling its specialized RL environments, will help it capture additional market share as the data wars intensify.\nFor now, Ansari says the company is focused on scaling responsibly, paying experts well, and keeping people at the center of an industry built on training machines.\nThe company currently manages thousands of experts across hundreds of domains, ranging from highly technical fields to surprisingly offline disciplines. Many earn close to $100 an hour, according to Ansari.\n\u201cThere are Harvard professors and Stanford PhDs spending half their week training AI through Micro1,\u201d Ansari said. \u201cBut the bigger shift is in the sheer volume and range of roles. It\u2019s expanding into areas you wouldn\u2019t expect to matter for language model training, including offline and less technical fields. We\u2019re very optimistic about where this is heading.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon reportedly considering dropping USPS and building a competing postal service\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nAmazon is considering ending its long-standing contract with the United States Postal Service and building out its own competing nationwide delivery network, according to The Washington Post.\nThe current agreement between the e-commerce giant and the USPS expires in October 2026. The two sides have spent months negotiating what the next version of the contract would look like, but those negotiations have been complicated by President Trump\u2019s push to privatize the USPS, the Post reports.\nUnder the current agreement, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency\u2019s revenue in 2025.\n\u201cThe USPS is a longstanding and trusted partner and we remain committed to working together,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement, adding that the company is discussing \u201cways to extend our partnership.\u201d\nBut Kelly said Amazon was \u201csurprised to hear\u201d the USPS wants to \u201crun an auction\u201d for some of its shipping capacity.\n\u201c[S]o we still have a lot to work through. Given the change of direction and the uncertainty it adds to our delivery network, we\u2019re evaluating all of our options that would ensure we can continue to deliver for our customers,\u201d he said.\nAmazon already operates a large transportation network that includes airplanes, Rivian electric vans, and a budding drone delivery service \u2014 though the drone program has faced a number of struggles this year, including most recently, a Federal Aviation Administration probe. It\u2019s also developing autonomous vehicles through its subsidiary Zoox.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThis story has been updated with a statement from Amazon.\n\ntitle4:\nAnthropic CEO weighs in on AI bubble talk and risk-taking among competitors\ndescription4:\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei shared his thoughts on if the AI industry was in a bubble at The New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday. This was in addition to throwing shade on one particular unnamed competitor, which was clearly OpenAI.\nAmodei declined to give a simple yes-or-no answer to the question of a bubble, saying it was a complex situation, but instead explained his thoughts about the economics of AI in more detail.\nHe described himself as bullish on the potential of the technology, but cautioned that there could be players in the ecosystem who might make a \u201ctiming error\u201d or could see \u201cbad things\u201d happen when it comes to the economic payoffs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an inherent risk when the timing of the economic value is uncertain,\u201d Amodei explained. He said companies had to take risks to compete with each other and authoritarian adversaries \u2014 a reference to the threat from China \u2014 but added that some players were not \u201cmanaging that risk well, who are taking unwise risks.\u201d\nThe issue, he said, is the uncertainty around how quickly the economic value of AI will grow and properly mapping that to the lag times on building more data centers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s [a] genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,\u201d Amodei said. \u201cAnd then I think there are some players who are \u2018YOLO-ing,\u2019 who pull the risk dial too far, and I\u2019m very concerned,\u201d he added, using the slang term for \u201cyou only live once,\u201d which is often used to justify risk-taking.\nPlus, he spoke to the question around AI chips\u2019 deprecation timelines. That\u2019s another hot-button topic and a factor that could negatively impact the industry\u2019s economics if GPUs become obsolete and lose their value ahead of schedule.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The issue is new chips come out that are faster and cheaper\u2026and so the value of old chips can go down somewhat,\u201d Amodei said.\nHe said Anthropic was making conservative assumptions on this front and others as it planned for an uncertain future.\nThe AI company\u2019s revenue has grown 10x per year over the past three years, the CEO said, going from zero to $100 million in 2023, then $100 million to $1 billion in 2024, and will land somewhere between $8-10 billion by the end of this year.\nBut Amodei said he would be \u201creally dumb\u201d to just assume that the pattern would continue. \u201cI don\u2019t know if a year from now, if it\u2019s going to be 20 billion or if it\u2019s going to be 50\u2026it\u2019s very uncertain. I try to plan conservatively. So I plan for the lower side of it, but that is very disconcerting,\u201d he said.\nAI companies like his have to plan how much compute they\u2019ll need in the years ahead, and how much they should invest in data centers. If they don\u2019t buy enough, they may not be able to serve their customers. And if they buy too much, they\u2019ll struggle to keep up with costs or, in the worst-case scenario, they could go bankrupt.\nLast month, OpenAI landed in a PR crises when its CFO said she wanted the U.S. government to \u201cbackstop\u201d her company\u2019s infrastructure loans, aka insure them so taxpayers would pick of the bill if OpenAI could not.
