    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday February 20), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAI-coding startup Codeium in talks to raise at an almost $3B valuation, sources say\ndescription0:\nCodeium, an AI-powered coding startup, is raising a new round of funding at a $2.85 billion valuation, including fresh capital, according to two sources with knowledge of the deal.\nThe round is being led by returning investor Kleiner Perkins, the people said.\nThe new round comes just six months after Silicon Valley-based Codeium announced that it had closed a $150 million Series C at a $1.25 billion post-money valuation led by General Catalyst with participation of Kleiner Perkins and Greenoaks. TechCrunch could not confirm the dollar amount of the new funding.\nCodeium and Kleiner Perkins didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe company has reached about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), one person said. Based on that revenue figure, Codeium\u2019s implied valuation is roughly 70 times ARR. That\u2019s a lot higher than other AI code editing companies.\nLast month, Anysphere, the maker of AI-powered coding assistant Cursor, announced a new funding round of financing at a $2.5 billion valuation. Based on its reported $100 million in revenue, investors assigned it a 25 times ARR valuation multiple.\nIn addition to Anysphere, which many investors say is the current leader in the category, Codeium competes with Poolside, Magic, Microsoft\u2019s GitHub Copilot, and many others.\nWhile it\u2019s not clear how Codeuim negotiated such a rich valuation, sources told TechCrunch that the company wasn\u2019t looking to raise new funds before investors approached it about this round.\nCodeium tries to distinguish itself from competitors by targeting companies rather than individual developers. Last summer, the company told TechCrunch that the free tier of its platform was being used by over 1,000 enterprise customers, including Anduril, Zillow, and Dell.\nIn November, the company introduced Windsurf Editor, which can write some of the code without human involvement, an approach that\u2019s known as agentic AI, or \u201cagent mode.\u201d Others, such as Cursor, also offer a similar feature.\nCodeium was founded in 2021 by Varun Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen. Prior to Codeium, Chen was at Meta, where he helped build software tools for VR headsets like the Oculus Quest. Mohan was a tech lead at Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup, responsible for managing the autonomy infrastructure team.\n\ntitle1:\nSaronic raises $600M to mass-produce autonomous warships\ndescription1:\nAustin-based defense startup Saronic has raised a $600 million Series C to build an autonomous ship factory called \u201cPort Alpha,\u201d it announced yesterday, quadrupling its valuation to $4 billion from its last round.\nInvestor Elad Gil led the round, with General Catalyst joining existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, 8VC, and Caffeinated Capital, among others.\nThat should make Saronic the second, possibly third, most valuable defense tech startup in the U.S. after Anduril\u2019s last round valued it at $14 billion. Shield AI could beat that, though, as it is reportedly in talks to hit a $5 billion valuation on a new round of funding. (Anduril is in talks to raise again at double its valuation, to $28 billion.)\nSaronic isn\u2019t the only defense tech darling with big manufacturing ambitions: Anduril, for example, announced plans to build a billion-dollar megafactory in Ohio last month.\nSaronic hasn\u2019t found a site for Port Alpha yet but is actively searching, a spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. Operations at the port, which Saronic is calling the \u201cshipyard of the future,\u201d are slated to begin within five years, Saronic\u2019s co-founder and CEO Dino Mavrookas told Defense News.\nSaronic has already developed three models of autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) that are up to 24 feet long \u2014 about half as long as a modern lifeboat. But Saronic says the factory will also build large unmanned ships, while bolstering U.S. shipbuilding capacity compared to China.\nUnmanned ships are a hot trend in naval warfare, in part thanks to Ukraine\u2019s successful use of drone ships to drive the Russian Navy out of Crimea, despite Ukraine having effectively no manned navy of its own.\nSaronic has now raised almost $850 million, Mavrookas said on CNBC, attributing the quadrupled valuation to Saronic\u2019s speed at developing new vessels and software.\nSaronic\u2019s raise is the latest sign that defense tech continues to hit new highs in Silicon Valley, buoyed by similar monster rounds.\n\ntitle2:\nX in talks to raise money at a $44B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nElon Musk\u2019s X is in talks to raise money from investors at a $44 billion valuation, Bloomberg News reports. Musk purchased X, formerly known as Twitter, for the same price back in 2022.\nThe news comes as Fidelity Investments marked down its Twitter stake back in December by around 70% from the 2022 sale price as the social network struggled to retain advertisers.\nBloomberg reports that talks for the new financing round are ongoing and details could change. It\u2019s possible that the company could also abandon the talks.\nThe investment round would be the first for the social network since Musk took it private.\nThe valuations of Musk\u2019s other companies have soared as he has taken a significant role in President Trump\u2019s administration. Tesla\u2019s shares have climbed more than 40% since Trump\u2019s election, and SpaceX was valued at $350 billion in December, a 67% jump from June. Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is also in talks to raise $10 billion at a $75 billion valuation.\n\ntitle3:\nHyundai\u2019s new Tesla charging port comes up short\ndescription3:\n\u201cLucky me,\u201d I thought as I navigated the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 into the last spot of a Tesla Supercharging station in Palm Springs.\nThe EV didn\u2019t really need any juice. But this refreshed compact all-electric SUV comes equipped with Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard port; it was time to test out how well Hyundai would match up with the Tesla Supercharging network.\nThe experience exposed a gap \u2014 in the literal sense. And while Hyundai shouldn\u2019t shoulder all the blame, it did illustrate how a seemingly good idea doesn\u2019t always translate in the real world.\nFor example, I reversed into the parking spot, opened the charge port on the passenger-rear quarter panel, and grabbed the charging cord, nestled in the cabinet sitting all the way over on the driver\u2019s side of the car.\nUh, Hyundai, we have a problem. It didn\u2019t reach.\nI could wait for another Tesla to vacate its space and use that charging cable, essentially taking up two spaces, or I could use the in-car navigation to find a CCS-equipped charging station and use the adapter that comes with the car.\nI chose to toddle on with my day as I had plenty of battery, but others might not be so lucky.\nImage Credits:hyundai\nCCS, or Combined Charging System, was the standard in North America and used by every automaker except for Tesla, which developed its own port and charging station called the North American Charging Standard, or NACS.\nAutomakers began to shift to NACS in May 2023 after Ford reached an agreement that would give owners of its EV access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. GM followed and within six months nearly every automaker had struck a similar deal with Tesla. Access would initially be accomplished with a Tesla adapter, but most of these automakers \u2014 Hyundai and Kia included \u2014 also agreed to integrate the NACS charging tech into their future EVs.\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 is one of these.\nOf course, not all of this is Hyundai\u2019s fault. The Ioniq 5 has always had its charging port on the rear passenger side, and moving it would be a spendy proposition. And Tesla says the problem should be solved with the rollout of its V4 charging stations with longer cables, although its website says, \u201cwe encourage all vehicle manufacturers to standardize charge port locations to the rear driver side or front passenger side.\u201d\nBuyers of the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 will have better luck finding a CCS station and using the adapter. Hyundai says the Ioniq 5 can go from 10% to 80% of charge in about 20 minutes at a CCS charger. The same fill-up will cost you up to 30 minutes at an NACS charger.\nHyundai makes it a bit easier with your choice of a $400 charging credit or a free ChargePoint home charger with the purchase of an Ioniq 5 and those with an older Hyundai EV with a native CCS port can get a free NACS adapter through the MyHyundai owner portal starting in March.\nHyundai owners will also have access to the planned Ionna charging network. The Ionna network, which is expected to have 30,000 NACS and CCS charging points by 2030, is a collaboration between BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, Kia, Stellantis, and Toyota.\n2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5: Bigger batteries, more range, new trim\nThe 2025 Ioniq 5, which will come in SE, SEL, XRT, and Limited trims in rear- or all-wheel drive, may look like its previous model years. But there are some key differences, starting with the battery size.\nThe standard range battery ratchets up 5 kWh to 63 kWh, while the extended range sits at 84 kWh, an increase of 6.6 kWh. Depending on the combination of drivetrain, battery, and trim, expect to see 245 miles of range on the low end and up to 318 miles of range for a rear-wheel-drive Ioniq 5 with the larger battery.\nPower output varies, too, starting with 168 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, growing to 225 ponies in the extended range battery. The most powerful setup settles in at 320 horsepower and 446 pound-feet of torque for all-wheel-drive cars with the bigger battery.\nTech upgrades\nImage Credits:hyundai\nThe 2025 Ioniq 5 has some new parlor tricks too.\nThe digital key function now works with your phone inside a pocket or purse, a nice upgrade for when you\u2019re juggling kids, groceries, and a drink.\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto are now wireless and all models have over-the-air updates.\nAdditionally, Hyundai Pay allows owners to add their credit card to the infotainment system to pay for reserved off-street parking automatically. Drivers also get updated blind-spot collision avoidance and parking assistance.\nLet\u2019s get dirty\nImage Credits:Hyundai\nFor those wanting a bit more adventure with their electric SUV, the Ioniq 5 now comes in the XRT trim.\nThis model is designed for venturing off the path just a bit thanks to a one-inch lift and 29-inch Continental CrossContact ATR tires for better performance in the dirt and over gravel. This model also gets a Terrain button on the steering wheel that offers up modes for Snow, Mud, and Sand.\nHyundai let me loose on a fun dirt loop and I found that the car has enough playfulness in it to induce a grin. Sand mode doesn\u2019t turn the traction control all the way off \u2014 you have to manually push the traction control button to do that. It does adjust the brake regen properties so the vehicle doesn\u2019t automatically start to slow down when you lift. It also splits the torque 50/50 for optimal traction.\nIt\u2019s fun to toss it into corners and get a little slidey, but the ABS system \u2014 while great on pavement \u2014 can interfere with traction and off-road stopping distances by not allowing any dirt to build up in front of the tire.\nImage Credits:Emme Hall\nIt would be great if the drive modes also tweaked this system. Still, the instant electric torque means it\u2019s easy to get on the throttle and power out of a turn and scream toward the next one, slinging dirt rooster tails in the process.\nThe XRT is not some kind of rock crawler. The total ground clearance is only seven inches \u2014 that\u2019s two inches less than a Subaru Forester Wilderness. The off-road geometry, while better than the Toyota RAV4 Woodland Edition, is meant more for small obstacles and undulations.\nI found the limit of the 19.8-degree approach angle on my drive and returned with part of the XRT-exclusive front fascia tworked just a bit. There isn\u2019t any special underbody protection for the battery in the XRT, but the departure angle is a healthy 30 degrees and the car comes equipped with two front tow hooks.\nWhere the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 shines\nImage Credits:Hyundai\nOn the pavement, the Ioniq 5 is just as enjoyable as it ever was, with zippy acceleration, well-balanced handling, and a comfortable ride.\nPart of my first drive took me to higher elevations where the all-season tires were put to the slushy snow test. The car never lost grip, inspiring confidence in this desert dweller.\nThe 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 starts at $43,975, including the destination fee for a base SE model in rear-wheel drive with the standard battery. The off-roady XRT can be had for $56,875 while a top Limited trim in all-wheel drive will set you back $59,575.\nYou can get a Ford Mustang Mach-E at a lower starting price and comparable range, and all Mach-E cars are standard equipped with the hands-free/eyes-up BlueCruise highway driving assist. You\u2019ll pay a subscription fee to use the technology, but Hyundai doesn\u2019t offer anything like it.\nIf you\u2019re into futuristic looks, the Kia EV6 is a worthy competitor, especially if you\u2019re looking for performance. The GT AWD trim nets 576 ponies and 545 pound-feet of torque. Yowza.\nIt\u2019s tough to find fault with the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. This refreshed Ioniq 5 maintains its pavement poise and adds a bit of adventure thrills with the new XRT trim. But owners may find themselves avoiding Tesla Superchargers despite that integrated NACS port.\n\ntitle4:\nMistral\u2019s Le Chat tops 1M downloads in just 14 days\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nA couple of weeks after the initial release of Mistral\u2019s AI assistant, Le Chat, the company told Le Parisien that it has reached one million downloads. In particular, Le Chat quickly reached the top spot for free downloads on the iOS App Store in the company\u2019s home country, France.\n\u201cGo and download Le Chat, which is made by Mistral, rather than ChatGPT by OpenAI \u2014 or something else,\u201d French president Emmanuel Macron said in a TV interview ahead of the recent AI Action Summit in Paris.\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first AI app that has taken off. Back in November 2023, OpenAI made a splash with its AI chatbot, ChatGPT. Despite being initially restricted to iOS users in the U.S., it managed to attract 500,000 downloads in just six days. (According to Appfigures\u2019 latest metrics, ChatGPT has now been downloaded 350 million times.)\nBetween January 10 and January 31, AI player DeepSeek\u2019s mobile app also recorded one million downloads. But that was just the beginning, as the Chinese app went viral in late January \u2014 attracting millions of additional new users in just a few days.\nMistral is also facing competition from veteran Big Tech companies, too. The likes of Google and Microsoft also want to take part in the AI assistant race and capture a spot on your phone\u2019s home screen, starting with Google\u2019s Gemini and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot.\"\n\nResponse:",
