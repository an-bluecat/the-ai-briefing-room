Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday December 17), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMark Zuckerberg says Threads now has 100M daily active users\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nMeta\u2019s X rival Threads is growing steadily with more than 100 million people using the service daily, the company\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Monday.\nZuckerberg also noted that Threads now has 300 million monthly active users, up from 275 million monthly active users in November.\nWhile Meta has regularly released updated numbers about monthly active Threads users, this is the first time the company has revealed daily active user figures.\nIn the past month, the company has aggressively released stats and features as rival social network Bluesky, which has over 25 million users, gained traction. Last month, Adam Mosseri noted that Threads has constantly seen a million sign-ups per day for three months.\nThe company also released features like the ability for users to create custom feeds, its take on \u2018starter packs\u2019 to create lists for new users to follow, and a way to change your default feed.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI brings its AI-powered web search tool to more ChatGPT users\ndescription1:\nChatGPT Search, OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered web search experience, is now live for all ChatGPT users \u2014 with several new features in tow.\nBy default, ChatGPT will automatically determine which questions to route through ChatGPT Search, or users can tap a new \u201cSearch the web\u201d icon in the ChatGPT interface. ChatGPT Search shows summarized answers from different online sources, as well as \u201crich\u201d content like embedded photos and YouTube videos.\nChatGPT Search launched in October as an evolution of OpenAI\u2019s SearchGPT prototype, unveiled this summer. Powered by a fine-tuned version of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model, ChatGPT Search serves up information from the web \u2014 like sports scores, news, stock quotes, and more \u2014 along with links to relevant sources, at which point users can ask follow-up questions to refine their search.\nChatGPT Search was initially only available for premium ChatGPT subscribers. Now nonpaying users can access it as well.\nChatGPT Search has also been made \u201cfaster,\u201d OpenAI said during a livestream Monday, and can now be set as the default search engine for any web browser. In addition, there\u2019s an improved ChatGPT Search experience for mobile. On mobile, users can now see, for example, better-organized business info, including addresses (in Apple Maps on the iOS ChatGPT app) and phone numbers.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nLastly, ChatGPT Search is now available in Advanced Voice Mode, OpenAI\u2019s real-time conversational feature for ChatGPT. In the coming days, users will be able to access up-to-date web info while using Advanced Voice Mode on mobile or desktop.\nMy colleague Max Zeff found ChatGPT Search to be a mixed bag when he tested it earlier this year. OpenAI is clearly intent on refining the feature, though, which it sees as a key avenue for growth.\nSome publishers have protested AI-powered search tools such as ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, and Google\u2019s AI Overviews, saying they threaten to cannibalize traffic to the sites from which they source their information. One study found that AI Overviews alone could negatively affect about 25% of publisher traffic due to the de-emphasis on links to web pages.\nOpenAI says it has incorporated feedback from partners about how ChatGPT Search decides which articles are most relevant to a query, as well as determining the summary length and quotations for articles.\n\ntitle2:\nTikTok asks Supreme Court for a lifeline as sell-or-ban deadline approaches\ndescription2:\nTikTok and ByteDance asked the United States Supreme Court to block the law that forces TikTok to be sold off or banned in the United States, according to an emergency filing with America\u2019s top court on Monday.\nThe social media company requested that the Supreme Court consider blocking the sell-or-ban law passed earlier this year by January 6. This would give American app stores and internet hosting providers just a few weeks to prepare for January 19, the deadline when the U.S. could force them to block TikTok.\n\u201cToday, TikTok is asking the Court to do what it has traditionally done in free speech cases: apply the most rigorous scrutiny to speech bans and conclude that it violates the First Amendment,\u201d said TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.\nAlso on Monday, TikTok CEO Shou Chew is reportedly meeting with President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, according to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. The meeting comes hours after Trump told reporters he has a \u201cwarm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d which is quite the change of heart considering Trump previously tried to ban TikTok with an executive order.\nThe TikTok ban was long destined for the Supreme Court, but now it finally appears to be headed there. TikTok has argued for months that this law hinders the free speech of millions of users, app stores, and the company itself. However, that argument has fallen flat so far with the Department of Justice, which last week asked a U.S. appeals court to reject ByteDance\u2019s motion to block the law.\n\ntitle3:\nWaymo robotaxis are coming to Tokyo in 2025\ndescription3:\nWaymo will begin testing its autonomous vehicle technology in Tokyo in early 2025, the first time the Alphabet company\u2019s robotaxis have driven on public roads outside the U.S.\nThe move to Japan is part of Waymo\u2019s \u201croad trips,\u201d a development program that involves bringing its technology to a variety of cities and testing it \u2014 with each city having different challenges. In Tokyo, the Waymo robotaxis will face left-hand driving and a dense urban environment.\nUntil now, those road trips have focused on a dozen U.S. cities, usually to test out specific conditions or environments such as rain in Miami or extreme heat in Death Valley, California. The company also has tested its vehicles in Buffalo; Washington, D.C.; Las Vegas; and Seattle. Typically, Waymo begins by bringing a small fleet to a city, where a human manually drives the vehicle and maps certain areas. The vehicles will eventually test in autonomous mode, at first with a human operator behind the wheel.\nWaymo said it will partner with taxi-hailing app GO and taxi company Nihon Kotsu as part of its Japanese \u201croad trip.\u201d Nihon Kotsu will oversee the management and servicing of the Waymo vehicles, according to the company.\nInitially, Nihon Kotsu drivers will operate the vehicles manually to map key areas of the Japanese capital, including Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d, Shinagawa, and K\u014dt\u014d. Waymo said it is working with Nihon Kotsu\u2019s team to train its employees how to operate Waymo\u2019s self-driving Jaguar I-Pace vehicles.\nThe announcement comes just a week since GM said it would scrap its Cruise robotaxi program, a decision that also ended plans to launch a driverless ride-hailing service in Japan with partner Honda. In October 2023, Honda, Cruise, and GM announced plans to launch a robotaxi service in Tokyo together in 2026 using Cruise\u2019s purpose-built robotaxis called The Origin.\n\ntitle4:\nSoftBank CEO announces a $100 billion investment into the US\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nOn Monday, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son joined President-elect Donald Trump to announce that his company would invest $100 billion into the U.S. over the next four years.\nIn a press conference at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump also announced that SoftBank\u2019s investment would create, at a minimum, 100,000 American jobs. Trump called it a \u201chistoric investment\u201d that will \u201chelp ensure that artificial intelligence, emerging technologies and other industries of tomorrow are built, created, and grown right here in the USA.\u201d\nSon and Trump have had a close working relationship since 2016 during Trump\u2019s first term, when Son announced that SoftBank would invest $50 billion in U.S. startups and create 50,000 jobs. At the Monday conference, Son said he chose to double his 2016 investment because \u201cPresident Trump is a double-down president, I\u2019m going to have to double down.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
