Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday July 2), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nFigma moves closer to a blockbuster IPO that could raise $1.5B\ndescription0:\nFigma publicly shared its financials Tuesday, inching the design software company closer to an IPO. And while this initial S-1 is missing details such as number of shares to be offered and what price, the regulatory filing provides the clearest view yet of its financial health \u2014 and potential.\nIPO experts Renaissance Capital estimate that Figma could raise up to $1.5 billion in this offering. If it does meet or exceed that, Figma\u2019s IPO will match or beat CoreWeave\u2019s, which raised $1.5 billion and has been the biggest tech IPO of 2025 so far.\nThere are some reasons to believe that Figma could pull it off. Its financials are impressive, per the S-1 filing.\nThe company brought in $749 million in revenue in 2024, a 48% jump from 2023. Figma\u2019s revenue continued to rise in the first quarter of 2025 with 46% year-over-year growth. The company reported rolling 12-month revenue as $821 million, with a 91% gross margin.\nFigma\u2019s profit is interesting, too. The company was profitable in 2023 and then swung to a giant loss of $732 million in 2023. But this was largely due to one-time expenses related to a major employee stock compensation event. (Figma issued 10.5 million stock options, with a strike price of $8.50 per share to eligible employees, it said.)\nBy the fourth quarter of 2024, Figma reported profits again, as it did in Q1 of 2025.\nFigma has also calculated its total debt to be so negligible that it reports it has none. But again, this is a line item that needs to be filled in. The company, naturally, has a revolving debt line, and left room to update its total debt in association with that.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nWe also don\u2019t know yet if any of the executives or VCs will be selling shares. Major backers include Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia.\nWe do know that in 2024, executives took part of a big tender offer that allowed employees to cash out of shares. For instance, Figma co-founder CEO and chairman Dylan Field cashed out of $20 million worth of shares as part of that sale.\nThe S-1 document made another interesting disclosure, about co-founder Evan Wallace, who left Figma in 2021, according to his website. Wallace is named in the documents as a co-founder. However, Figma says Wallace has given Field full voting rights and control over his shares. Wallace\u2019s family trust holds about one-third of the super-voting rights Class B shares (15 votes per share, Figma says). All told, the S-1 discloses that Field, pre-IPO, controls about 75% of the voting rights.\nThe financials certainly look like the kind of company that Wall Street and retail investors typically like to buy. The one black cloud, if you can call it that, is the rise of vibe coding/designing AI apps. Upstarts like Lovable are targeting Figma\u2019s market and growing fast. Figma, though, has its own set of AI products as well.\nFigma acknowledges in the S-1 the risks of failing to stand out in a competitive AI industry.\n\u201cWhile we have made, and expect to continue to make, significant investments to integrate AI, including\ngenerative AI, into our platform, AI technologies are rapidly evolving and there can be no guarantee that\nour products will remain competitive as new AI technologies are developed, adopted, and integrated into\nsoftware solutions,\u201d the company says in the regulatory document.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle\u2019s data center energy use doubled in 4 years\ndescription1:\nNo wonder Google is desperate for more power: The company\u2019s data centers more than doubled their electricity use in just four years.\nThe eye-popping stat comes from Google\u2019s most recent sustainability report, which it released late last week. In 2024, Google data centers used 30.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity. That\u2019s up from 14.4 million megawatt-hours in 2020, the earliest year Google broke out data center consumption.\nGoogle has pledged to use only carbon-free sources of electricity to power its operations, a task made more challenging by its breakneck pace of data center growth.\nAnd the company\u2019s electricity woes are almost entirely a data center problem. In 2024, data centers accounted for 95.8% of the entire company\u2019s electron budget.\nImage Credits:Tim De Chant/TechCrunch\nThe company\u2019s ratio of data-center-to-everything-else has been remarkably consistent over the last four years. Though 2020 is the earliest year Google has made data center electricity consumption figures available, it\u2019s possible to use that ratio to extrapolate back in time. Some quick math reveals that Google\u2019s data centers likely used just over 4 million megawatt-hours of electricity in 2014. That\u2019s sevenfold growth in just a decade.\nThe tech company has already picked most of the low-hanging fruit by improving the efficiency of its data centers. Those efforts have paid off, and the company is frequently lauded for being at the leading edge. But as the company\u2019s power usage effectiveness (PUE) has approached the theoretical ideal of 1.0, progress has slowed. Last year, Google\u2019s company-wide PUE dropped to 1.09, a 0.01 improvement over 2023 but only 0.02 better than a decade ago.\nIt\u2019s clear that Google needs more electricity, and to keep to its carbon-free pledge, it has been investing heavily in a range of energy sources, including geothermal, both flavors of nuclear power, and renewables.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nGeothermal shows promise for data center operations. By tapping into Earth\u2019s heat, enhanced geothermal power plants can consistently generate electricity regardless of the weather. And many startups, including Google-backed Fervo Energy, are making it possible to drill profitable wells in more places.\nOn the nuclear fusion side, Google last week announced it would invest in Commonwealth Fusion Systems and buy 200 megawatts of electricity from its forthcoming Arc power plant, scheduled to come online in the early 2030s. In the nuclear fission world, Google has pledged to buy 500 megawatts of electricity from Kairos Power, a small modular reactor startup.\nThe nuclear deals have yet to deliver power \u2014 and they won\u2019t for five years or more. In the meantime, the company has been on a renewable energy buying spree. In May, the company bought 600 megawatts of solar capacity in South Carolina, and in January, it announced a deal for 700 megawatts of solar in Oklahoma. Google said in 2024 it was working with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to build several gigawatts\u2019 worth of carbon-free power plants, a $20 billion investment.\nThe outlay isn\u2019t surprising given that solar and (to a lesser extent) wind are the only two sources of power that are readily available before the end of the decade.\nNew nuclear power plants take years to permit and build, and even the most optimistic timelines don\u2019t see them connecting to the grid or a data center before the end of the decade. Natural gas, which the U.S. has plenty of, is hamstrung by five-plus-year waitlists for new turbines. That leaves renewables paired with battery storage.\nGoogle has contracted with enough renewables to match its total consumption, though those sources don\u2019t always deliver electrons when and where the company needs them.\n\u201cWhen we announced to the world that we would achieve that 100% annual matching goal, we were very clear that wasn\u2019t the end state,\u201d Michael Terrell, Google\u2019s head of advanced energy, told reporters last week. \u201cThe end game was 24/7 carbon-free energy around the clock everywhere we operate at all times.\u201d\nGoogle has some work to do.\nWorldwide, the company has about 66% of its data center consumption, matched to the hour, powered by carbon-free electricity. But that average papers over some regional challenges. While its Latin American data centers hit 92% last year, its Middle East and Africa facilities are only at 5%.\nThose hurdles are part of why Google is investing in stable, carbon-free sources like fission and fusion, Terrell said. \u201cIn order for us to eventually reach this goal, we are going to have to have these technologies,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle2:\nxAI raises $10B in debt and equity\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nElon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, has raised $10 billion in debt and equity, Morgan Stanley confirmed on Monday.\nIn a post on X, the financial giant said xAI had raised $5 billion in debt and another $5 billion in a separate strategic equity transaction.\n\u201cThe combination of debt and equity reduces the overall cost of capital and substantially expands pools of capital available to xAI. The proceeds will support xAI\u2019s continued development of cutting-edge AI solutions, including one of the world\u2019s largest data center [sic] and its flagship Grok platform,\u201d Morgan Stanley wrote.\nxAI did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours.\nThis latest funding follows a $6 billion round that the company raised in December from a slate of big-name investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Blackrock, Fidelity, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Nvidia, AMD, and Kingdom Holdings, a Saudi conglomerate.\nThe new equity round brings xAI\u2019s total capital raised to about $17 billion.\n\ntitle3:\nNikita Bier joins X as head of product: 'I've officially posted my way to the top'\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nElon Musk\u2019s X has appointed serial entrepreneur and growth hacker Nikita Bier as its new head of product.\n\u201cI\u2019ve officially posted my way to the top,\u201d Bier wrote on X, alluding to his large presence on the app.\nBier is best known as the founder of apps like Gas, which was acquired by Discord, and TBH, which was acquired by Facebook. Both Gas and TBH were apps geared toward teens, who were encouraged to leave one another compliments.\nMore recently, Bier has been working as a venture partner at Lightspeed and as an adviser to the Solana Foundation.\nNever give up \u2014 Nikita Bier (@nikitabier) June 30, 2025\n\u201cWhile I already spend every waking hour on this app, I\u2019ll now be spending that time helping others unlock that same value,\u201d Bier wrote on X about his new position. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll certainly be leveraging the power of Grok to create hyper-relevant timelines and help people understand everything that\u2019s happening. Thanks @elonmusk and the X team for inviting me to work on the product that I live and breathe.\u201d\nElon Musk, in return, posted \u201cWelcome to X\u201d and replied to Bier, \u201cLFG!!\u201d followed by two rocket ship emojis.\nBier\u2019s success to date has relied not only on his ability to build apps that resonate with a younger demographic, but also on driving growth for those apps over a short period. At X, he could potentially build features that drive adoption beyond the user base that\u2019s typically drawn to text-first social networks.\nAlready, he\u2019s hinted at plans for what comes next, posting to X that \u201csomeone should fix notifications,\u201d and suggesting he had prototyped a deeper Grok integration during his interview.\n\ntitle4:\nCongress just greenlit a NASA moon plan opposed by Musk and Isaacman\ndescription4:\nLegacy aerospace giants scored a win Tuesday when the U.S. Senate passed President Trump\u2019s budget reconciliation bill that earmarks billions more for NASA\u2019s flagship Artemis program.\nThe $10 billion addition to the Artemis architecture, which includes funding for additional Space Launch System rockets and an orbiting station around the moon called Gateway, is a rebuke to critics who wished to see alternative technologies used instead. Among those critics are SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who Musk proposed as the next NASA administrator.\nThere\u2019s no sign the souring relations between Musk and Trump are recovering. If Trump signs the bill, the fallout, which began after the president\u2019s abrupt revocation of Isaacman\u2019s nomination, will likely continue \u2014 if not escalate.\nMusk in particular has taken aim at the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on the grounds that it is fully expendable. Unlike SpaceX\u2019s family of rockets, which are all designed to be reusable, SLS is one-time use only. As Musk put it back in 2020, that means \u201ca billion dollar rocket is blown up\u201d every time it is launched. Even that may have been an understatement; more recent figures from NASA\u2019s watchdog put recurring production costs closer to $2.5 billion each.\nA total of around $24 billion has been poured into SLS production to date, funds that have primarily gone to a consortium of aerospace primes, including Boeing, L3Harris\u2019 Aerojet Rocketdyne, and Northrop Grumman, which leads construction of the major rocket components.\nDuring his recent confirmation hearings with the Senate, Isaacman questioned the massive sums. He affirmed using SLS for the next two Artemis missions, but ultimately said he didn\u2019t think the rocket was \u201cthe long\u2011term way to get to and from the moon and to Mars with great frequency.\u201d\nCongress \u2014 and Trump, if he decides to sign the bill into law \u2014 have decided to press ahead. Around $4.1 billion of the $10 billion total added to the document will go toward additional SLS rockets for Artemis missions 4 and 5. Meanwhile, around $2.6 billion will go toward completion of the Gateway station.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster. Connect deeper.
