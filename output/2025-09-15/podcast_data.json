    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday September 16), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nWith no DOJ breakup, Alphabet becomes a $3 trillion company\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nAlphabet hit just over $3 trillion dollars in market cap on Monday as investors continue to reward it after a federal judge declined to break the company up.\nOn Sept. 2, U.S. District Court Judge Amit P. Mehta outlined softer-than-feared remedies for his year-ago ruling that Google maintained an illegal monopoly in search. The DOJ had proposed stronger remedies, including that Alphabet-owned Google be forced to sell Chrome. Tech companies like Perplexity and Ecosia lined up with unsolicited bids. But that possibility has been nixed.\nBeyond Google\u2019s cash cow of search, its cloud computing business is also growing rapidly on the strength of its AI offerings. Alphabet now joins Nvidia ($4.3T), Microsoft ($3.8T) and Apple ($3.5T) in the three-t club with Amazon next up but a lap behind ($2.5T).\n\ntitle1:\nUS, China reach 'framework' deal for TikTok\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nThe U.S. has reached a \u201cframework\u201d deal with China for social media platform TikTok, CNBC reported, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\u201cIt\u2019s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon,\u201d CNBC quoted Bessent as saying on the sidelines of a meeting between the two countries in Madrid on Monday.\nThe news comes barely an hour after U.S. president Donald Trump hinted on his social media platform Truth Social that a deal for the short-video app had been reached.\n\u201cA deal was also reached on a \u2018certain\u2019 company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save,\u201d Trump said in the post, adding that he will speak to China\u2019s president Xi Jinping on Friday.\nTrump\u2019s post comes days before the fourth TikTok ban deadline on September 17, as delegations from both countries met in Madrid today to discuss economic policy. In June, the president indicated that he had found a group of buyers for TikTok.\nEarlier on Monday, Reuters reported that the U.S. was ready to ban the social media app if China did not withdraw its demands for a reduction in tariffs and loosening limits around its technology.\nThe U.S. banned TikTok on January 19 after a federal law signed by former president Joe Biden went into effect. However, Trump has signed multiple executive orders since he took office to keep the app working in the country.\n\ntitle2:\nSnap unveils Snap OS 2.0 with native browser, WebXR support, and more\ndescription2:\nSnap has unveiled the second version of its Snap OS, the software powering its AR glasses known as Snap Spectacles. The update includes a new native browser, WebXR support, and more. The launch comes as the company rolled out its fifth-generation Snap Spectacles for developers last year and plans to launch a consumer version sometime in 2026.\nThe release also comes just ahead of Meta\u2019s Connect conference this week, where the company is expected to reveal its latest updates in smart glasses, AI, and other technology.\nSnap OS 2.0 introduces a faster browser that\u2019s easier to use, the company says. Snap has optimized page loading speed and power usage to allow users to navigate quickly.\nThere\u2019s also a new home screen with widgets and bookmarks, alongside an updated toolbar that lets users type or speak a website URL, navigate history, and refresh the page. Plus, users can now resize windows just like they would on a laptop.\nImage Credits:Snap\nSnap notes that the browser now supports WebXR, allowing users to access augmented reality experiences directly from any WebXR-enabled website.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a new Spotlight Lens that spatially overlays content onto the real world. Now users can do things like wash dishes while watching videos from their favorite creators.\n\u201cThe portrait orientation of our Spectacles\u2019 field of view is a perfect fit for vertical video, allowing you to enjoy content without ever having to look down at your phone,\u201d Snap explained in a blog post. \u201cEasily anchor Spotlight in one place, or have it follow you as you move around.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

With this round, the consumer electronics company is now valued at $1.3 billion.\nOther investors in the round included existing backers such as venture outfits GV, Highland Europe, EQT, Latitude, I2BF, and Tapestry. The company, founded by Carl Pei \u2014 who previously co-founded Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus, known for high-performance devices at competitive prices \u2014 also received new strategic backing from Nikhil Kamath and Qualcomm Ventures. The new funding takes Nothing\u2019s total funding to over $450 million.\n\u201cCarl and the team at Nothing are reimagining hardware and software with an AI overlay to position their products for the next era of personal technology. We\u2019re excited to partner with this exceptional team as they pioneer AI-native experiences,\u201d said Matt Watcher, a partner at Tiger Global, in a statement to TechCrunch.\nThe company has bet on design differentiation so far, and it has served the startup well. Nothing says it clocked in over $1 billion in total sales earlier this year. An early investor in the startup told TechCrunch that they are happy with the company\u2019s growth trajectory and road to profitability.\nThe startup said that up to this point, it has spent time building a supply chain and infrastructure to launch a product within months and ship it worldwide. Notably, its recently launched Phone (3) \u2014 which showcases the company\u2019s signature transparent design aesthetic and unique user interface \u2014 was only its second handset to receive general distribution in the U.S.\nNothing Phone 3 Image Credits: Ivan Mehta Image Credits:Ivan Mehta\nPei has said that he wants to target his brand towards the next generation of users who might seek alternatives beyond incumbents.\n\u201cThe way we\u2019ve differentiated our brand and differentiated our products is really resonating with our group of consumers. We\u2019re targeting the next generation. They\u2019re interested in tech. They\u2019re interested in creativity and design, and we really found resonance among that consumer group,\u201d he told TechCrunch during the Phone (3)\u2019s launch in July.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nHighland Europe partner Tony Zappal\u00e0, who is an existing investor in the company, said that the company has delivered on its promises and has room to grow in this huge industry. He said that Nothing is now a recognized name in the industry, which has its own advantages in terms of attracting talent and building supply chain relationships.\nAI vision\nThe company wants to build an operating system with AI and personalization features that might extend beyond smartphones. Currently, we have only seen a few glimpses of AI in the operating system with features like Essential Search, a smart search function that helps users find information across their device. The startup has hired S\u00e9lim Benayat, a former executive from Linktree and founder of Bento (a platform that creates personalized landing pages for social media profiles), to lead its AI services efforts.\nZappal\u00e0 said that the challenge in building such an operating system is both a customer experience and a trust issue.\n\u201cI think the challenge of building an effective AI-first experience is not unique to Nothing. This is more than a technical challenge; AI features need to reach a stage where users are not double-checking the output,\u201d he said.\nCompanies like Apple have struggled to integrate AI features effectively into their operating systems. For Nothing, the difficulty is finding the right balance between newness and helpfulness while executing AI features.\nPei believes that smartphones remain the best way to deliver AI, and they will be \u201cthe dominant form factor for all consumer AI applications\u201d for at least three to five years, he said during the conversation with TechCrunch in July.\nWith this fundraising announcement, the company said it plans to launch an AI-first device next year. However, there haven\u2019t been many success stories in the AI hardware space. AI hardware startup Humane was sold to HP after struggling with its AI Pin device, and AI assistant company Rabbit has has been working to improve its R1 device, releasing a new software update recently after the company wasn\u2019t satisfied with the first iteration.\n\ntitle4:\nRobinhood plans to launch a startups fund open to all retail investors\ndescription4:\nRobinhood announced Monday it has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a new publicly traded fund that will hold shares of startups.\nThe idea behind the \u201cRobinhood Ventures Fund I\u201d is to allow every retail investor access to make money on the hottest startups before they go public.\nWhile the current version of the application is public, Robinhood hasn\u2019t filled in the fine-print yet. This means we don\u2019t know how many shares it plans to sell, nor other details like the management fee it plans to charge. It\u2019s also unclear which startups it hopes this fund will eventually hold. The paperwork says it \u201cexpects\u201d to invest in aerospace and defense, AI, fintech, robotics as well as software for consumers and enterprises.\nRobinhood\u2019s big pitch is that retail investors are being left out of the gains that are amassed by startup investors like VCs. That\u2019s true to an extent. \u201cAccredited investors\u201d \u2014 or those with a net worth large enough to handle riskier investments \u2014 already have a variety of ways of buying equity in startups, such as with venture firms like OurCrowd.\nRetail investors who are not rich enough to be accredited have more limited options. There are funds similar to what Robinhood has proposed, including Cathy Wood\u2019s ARK Venture Fund, a mutual fund which holds stakes in companies like Anthropic, Databricks, OpenAI, SpaceX, and others.\nRobinhood\u2019s last such effort was controversial. The trading company launched what it called private \u201ctokenized\u201d stocks in the EU earlier this year, implying these tokens gave retail investors the ability to make money from shares of private companies like OpenAI. However, OpenAI denounced the product, pointing out that buyers of these tokens were not actually buying OpenAI stock \u2014 tokenized or otherwise. They were simply buying tokens pegged to prices of a private company\u2019s stock.\nThis new closed-end \u201cVentures Fund I\u201d is a more classic, mutual fund-style, approach. As to when Robinhood\u2019s new fund will be available we don\u2019t know that either yet. Robinhood, which is in a quiet period, declined to comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
