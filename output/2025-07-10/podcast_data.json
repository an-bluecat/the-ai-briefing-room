Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday July 11), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAWS is launching an AI agent marketplace next week with Anthropic as a partner\ndescription0:\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is launching an AI agent marketplace next week and Anthropic is one of its partners, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.\nThe AWS agent marketplace launch will take place at the AWS Summit in New York City on July 15, two people familiar with the development told TechCrunch. AWS and Anthropic did not respond to requests for comments.\nAI agents are ubiquitous nowadays. And every single investor in Silicon Valley is bullish on startups building them \u2014 even if there is some disagreement on exactly what defines an AI agent. The term is somewhat ambiguous and is loosely used to describe computer programs that can make decisions and perform tasks independently, such as interacting with software, by using an AI model at the backend.\nAI behemoths such as OpenAI and Anthropic are promoting it as the next big thing in tech. However, the distribution of AI agents poses a challenge, as most companies offer them in silos. AWS appears to be taking a step to address this with its new move.\nThe company\u2019s dedicated agent marketplace will allow startups to directly offer their AI agents to AWS customers. The marketplace will also allow enterprise customers to browse, install, and look for AI agents based on their requirements from a single location, a source said.\nThat could give Anthropic \u2014 and other AWS agent marketplace partners \u2014 a considerable boost.\nAnthropic, which already has Amazon\u2019s backing and is reportedly in line for another multibillion-dollar investment from the e-commerce company, views AI\u2019s future primarily in terms of agents \u2014 at least for the coming years. Anthropic builds AI agents in-house and enables developers to create them using its API.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nAWS\u2019 marketplace would help Anthropic reach more customers, including those who may already use AI agents from its rivals, such as OpenAI. Anthropic\u2019s involvement in the marketplace could also attract more developers to use its API to create more agents, and eventually increase its revenues. The company already hit $3 billion in annualized revenue in late May.\nLike any other online marketplace, AWS will take a cut of the revenue that startups earn from agent installations. However, this share will be minimal compared to the marketplace\u2019s potential to unlock new revenue streams and attract customers.\nThe marketplace model will allow startups to charge customers for agents. The structure is similar to how a marketplace might price SaaS offerings rather than bundling them into broader services, one of the sources said.\nAmazon is not the first tech giant to offer a marketplace for agents. In April, Google Cloud introduced an AI Agent Marketplace to help developers and businesses list, buy, and sell AI agents. Microsoft also introduced a similar offering, called Agent Store, within Microsoft 365 Copilot a month later. Similarly, enterprise software providers, including Salesforce and ServiceNow, have their own agent marketplaces.\nThat said, we have yet to see how successful these marketplaces are for smaller AI startups and enterprises seeking specific AI agents.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia reportedly plans to release new AI chip designed for China\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nNvidia seems determined to find a way to sell AI chips in China despite U.S. export restrictions.\nThe semiconductor giant is planning to launch an AI chip specifically for the Chinese market as early as September, as originally reported by the Financial Times.\nThis AI chip would be based on Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell RTX Pro 6000 processor, which is already modified to meet the existing AI chip restrictions, the Financial Times added. These chips wouldn\u2019t include high-bandwidth memory or NVLink, Nvidia\u2019s high-speed but low-latency communication interface, both of which are features of the company\u2019s advanced AI chips.\nLast month, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company would no longer include the Chinese market in its revenue and profit forecasts. Maybe that will be a short-lived change.\nNvidia declined to comment on the news.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson added, \u201cWith the current export controls, we are effectively out of the China datacenter market, which is now served only by competitors such as Huawei. China has one of the largest populations of developers in the world, creating open-source foundation models and non-military applications used globally. While security is paramount, every one of those applications should run best on the U.S. AI stack.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nTesla is already trying to expand its robotaxi service to Arizona\ndescription2:\nTesla has applied to test and operate autonomous vehicles in Arizona in a bid to bring its fledgling robotaxi service to the Metro Phoenix area, the state\u2019s Department of Transportation confirmed to TechCrunch.\nTesla contacted the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) under the Arizona Department of Transportation on June 26 to begin the certification process, a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The company, which launched a limited robotaxi service in South Austin last month, expressed interest in operating within the Phoenix Metro area, according to the department.\nTesla has applied for both autonomous vehicle testing and operating with a driver and testing/operating without a driver. A decision is expected at the end of the month, the DOT MVD spokesperson said. The company\u2019s contact with the state\u2019s DOT was first revealed by Tesla influencer Sawyer Merritt earlier on Thursday.\nTesla\u2019s reach-out came from Casey Blaine, the company\u2019s senior regulatory counsel, and she has already held a virtual meeting with the state\u2019s DOT as well as with Arizona\u2019s Commerce Authority, according to emails obtained by TechCrunch through a records request.\nThose conversations are in the preliminary stages, according to the emails, with Blaine asking a DOT representative to introduce him to Maricopa County government and law enforcement officials ahead of any launch. Blaine did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTesla launched in June a limited robotaxi service in South Austin that is currently open only to people the company invites. But CEO Elon Musk wrote Thursday on his social media platform X that Tesla plans to expand that service farther into the city soon. He also said Tesla is waiting on regulatory approvals to launch robotaxis in the Bay Area, which he said will happen in a \u201cmonth or two.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s robotaxi ambitions may bump up against regulatory reality, at least in California. Arizona, California, and Texas \u2014 all states Musk wants to see Tesla robotaxis \u2014 have different requirements.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nIn California, companies that want to test and eventually deploy autonomous vehicles have to receive a series of different permits from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Those permits cover the various stages of testing autonomous vehicles with and without a human safety operator behind the wheel, and eventually deploying a driverless vehicle. However, companies that want to operate a robotaxi service must also receive permits from the California Public Utilities Commission.\nA California DMV spokesperson said in an emailed statement that Tesla has held an autonomous vehicle testing permit for public road testing with a safety driver since 2014.\n\u201cIf Tesla intends to conduct driverless testing or deploy autonomous technology, it must apply for the appropriate permit,\u201d the CA DMV statement reads. \u201cTo date, Tesla has not applied for either a driverless testing or deployment permit.\u201d\nThe process in Arizona isn\u2019t as arduous, although there are steps to navigate.\nUnder Arizona statute, autonomous vehicle companies are required to follow a self-certification process for either testing with or without a driver, as outlined on the ADOT website.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean Tesla \u2014 or any AV company that completes the self-certification process \u2014 can operate a robotaxi service that charges for rides. Any company that wants to operate a ride-hailing service, human or robot driven, must apply for a Transportation Network Company permit.\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle company, operates a driverless robotaxi service in about 315 square miles of the Metro Phoenix area, which includes downtown, Tempe, Scottsdale, Chandler, parts of Mesa, and trips to and from the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. The company recently launched a new program that allows teens, with parental permission, to hail robotaxis in Phoenix.\nWaymo holds the appropriate AV and TNC permits in Arizona. The company also has all of the required permits to deploy and operate a robotaxi service in Los Angeles and the Bay Area, along with numerous Silicon Valley cities, in California. Waymo also operates a robotaxi service in partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta.\n\ntitle3:\nFormer Intel CEO launches a benchmark to measure AI alignment\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nAfter former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger capped off a more than 40-year career at the semiconductor giant in December, many wondered where Gelsinger would go next. On Thursday, the former Intel CEO revealed one piece of his next chapter: trying to ensure AI models support a flourishing humanity.\nIn partnership with a \u201cfaith tech\u201d company he first invested in roughly 10 years ago called Gloo, Gelsinger launched a new benchmark \u2014 Flourishing AI, or FAI \u2014 to test how well AI models align with certain human values. The FAI benchmark is based on The Global Flourishing Study, a survey directed by Harvard and Baylor University, to measure human well-being around the world.\nGloo took six core categories from the study \u2014 Character and Virtue, Close Social Relationships, Happiness and Life Satisfaction, Meaning and Purpose, Mental and Physical Health, Financial and Material Stability \u2014 and added one more, Faith and Spirituality, to test LLMs.\nIn an interview with The New Stack, Gelsinger said he\u2019s \u201clived at the intersection of faith tech my entire life.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nSamsung to launch a triple-folding phone this year\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nSamsung just yesterday launched its newest slate of foldable smartphones, but that might not be the only foldable phones the company releases this year: The company is reportedly preparing to launch a triple-folding smartphone before the year\u2019s end.\nSamsung\u2019s consumer electronics head TM Roh told The Korea Times that the company aims to release such a device this year.\n\u201cI expect we will be able to launch the tri-fold phone within this year. We are now focusing on perfecting the product and its usability, but we have not decided on its name. As the product nears completion, we are planning to make a final decision soon,\u201d he told the publication.\nSeparately, another unnamed executive confirmed to Android Authority that a tri-fold device by Samsung is ready to go into production.\"\n\nResponse:",
