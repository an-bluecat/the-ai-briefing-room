Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The deal comes after both companies announced last week they would jointly invest $100 billion in Stargate, a U.S. data center project for OpenAI that could expand to $500 billion over four years.\nSoftBank plans to invest $15 billion to $25 billion directly into OpenAI in addition to its $15 billion Stargate commitment, the report said. OpenAI will invest around $15 billion in Stargate, with SoftBank\u2019s equity investment potentially covering OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure commitment.\nThe talks come at a time when Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s release of its R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model, which was built on a relatively modest budget, rattled public markets this week.\nThe chip giant Nvidia lost as much as $589 billion in a day before making a slight recovery, as investors worried that big investments in expensive AI hardware might not be necessary if companies could achieve similar results with fewer resources.\nOpenAI claimed earlier this week that it had found evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI\u2019s proprietary models to train R1 and other models through a technique called \u201cdistillation,\u201d which allows developers to achieve similar performance with smaller models at a much lower cost. The company says this would violate its terms of service, which prohibit using outputs to develop competing models.\nOpenAI\u2019s deal with SoftBank, which Financial Times says hasn\u2019t finalized, represents SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son\u2019s biggest bet since injecting $16 billion into WeWork. It would also reduce OpenAI\u2019s dependence on Microsoft for computing resources, with Microsoft recently agreeing to give up its position as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud provider.\nAround 20% of Stargate\u2019s funding is expected to be equity, with the remainder financed through debt secured against assets and cash flow, the report said. OpenAI, which reached a $157 billion valuation last year, is also negotiating to become a for-profit company to facilitate additional fundraising.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs posts $5 billion loss in fourth quarter\ndescription1:\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, demonstrates the Meta Quest Pro during the virtual Meta Connect event in New York on Oct. 11, 2022.\nMeta continues to lose billions of dollars developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to underpin the nascent metaverse.\nThe social media giant reported fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday and said its Reality Labs unit recorded an operating loss of $4.97 billion while generating $1.1 billion in sales. Analysts were projecting that unit to log a fourth-quarter operating loss of $5.4 billion on $1.1 billion in sales.\nReality Labs is Meta's unit that makes the Quest family of virtual-reality headsets and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg kick-started his company's VR endeavors in 2014 when it acquired the startup Oculus for $2 billion. Since then, Zuckerberg has characterized VR and AR as central to his plans to develop the futuristic digital world known as the metaverse, which he has said represent the next major computing platform.\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft probing whether DeepSeek improperly used OpenAI APIs\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nJust a few hours after David Sacks claimed DeepSeek used OpenAI\u2019s models to train its own models, Bloomberg Law reports that Microsoft is investigating DeepSeek\u2019s use of OpenAI\u2019s application programming interface (API).\nAccording to security researchers working for Microsoft, the Chinese company behind the R1 reasoning model may have exfiltrated a large amount of data using OpenAI\u2019s API in the fall of 2024. Microsoft, which also happens to be OpenAI\u2019s largest shareholder, notified OpenAI of the suspicious activity.\nWhile anyone can sign up and access OpenAI\u2019s API, the company\u2019s terms of service stipulate that you can\u2019t use the output to train a new AI model.\nYou are prohibited from using \u201cOutput to develop models that compete with OpenAI,\u201d the company writes in its terms of use. Additionally, the company says that you can\u2019t \u201cautomatically or programmatically [extract] data or Output.\u201d\nThe core issue seems to come from distillation, a method used by AI model developers to extract knowledge from another model using a teacher-student sort of behavior. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see whether DeepSeek has found innovative ways to circumvent OpenAI\u2019s rate limits and query its API at scale. If that\u2019s the case, there will certainly be legal ramifications.\n\ntitle3:\nThreads adds another 20M monthly users since December, reaching 320M\ndescription3:\nThreads, Meta\u2019s microblogging service, is growing at a fast pace as users gravitate to the app over rivals like X. During the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings presentation on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Threads now has 320 million monthly active users (MAUs), up from 300 million last month. The app had 275 million monthly active users in November.\nThe increase in MAUs, although modest, serves as an indicator that Threads is maintaining its status as a preferred platform for many users amid a crowded landscape of social media apps, including Bluesky, Mastodon, X, and others. In comparison, Bluesky is experiencing a slowdown in growth, with an increase of less than 10% month-over-month in December 2024, following a remarkable 189% growth in November, according to analytics firm Similarweb. Bluesky now has a total of 26.44 million users.\nAdditionally, Zuckerberg noted that Threads is adding more than 1 million daily signups.\nMeta has been working to draw in more users to Threads by regularly introducing features such as scheduling posts and allowing people to see the number of views on their individual posts. Additionally, it seems that Meta may be looking to leverage the expanding reach of Threads with a new ad experiment in the U.S. and Japan.\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s call, Meta\u2019s chief financial officer, Susan Li, also highlighted that Threads is making several updates to its recommendation systems, which aim to \u201cprioritize more recent posts, surface content from top creators, and ensure people see more of the content from accounts they follow,\u201d Li said. The company will also continue enhancing custom feeds to allow users to create more personalized feeds based on their interests.\n\ntitle4:\nASML earnings report Q4 2024\ndescription4:\nIn this article ASML-NL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nA logo on the exterior of the ASML Holding NV headquarters in Veldhoven, Netherlands, on Wednesday, Jan. 24, 2024. Peter Boer | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nDutch semiconductor giant ASML on Wednesday reported a big jump in fourth-quarter net bookings, suggesting strong demand for its advanced chipmaking tools even as DeepSeek's low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending. ASML shares surged as much as 11% during morning deals, but later pared gains later in the day to close 5.6% higher. Here's how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the fourth quarter: Net sales: 9.26 billion euros ($9.64 billion) versus 9.07 billion euros expected.\nNet profit: 2.69 billion euros versus 2.64 billion euros expected. ASML said that net bookings, a key indicator of order demand, came in at 7.09 billion euros. That was up 169% from the 2.63 billion euros ASML reported in the third quarter, and exceeded the 3.99 billion euros expected by analysts polled by Visible Alpha, according to Reuters. The semiconductor equipment maker also said that its 2025 full-year sales outlook remains unchanged from its previous guidance of between 30 billion and 35 billion euros of total revenue. ASML had an order backlog of approximately 36 billion euros at the end of 2024, CFO Roger Dassen said in a transcript of a video interview.\nDefying DeepSeek concerns\nASML suffered losses during a global tech sell-off earlier in the week after the rollout of Chinese startup DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model, which claims to undercut OpenAI on both cost and performance.\nThe move triggered questions over eyewatering spending from the likes of leading AI players OpenAI and Microsoft on Nvidia graphics processing units, which are needed to train and run the most advanced AI models. This could hit demand for ASML's high-precision extreme ultraviolet (EUV) machines, which are used to print the most advanced microchips. EUV tools accounted for 3 billion euros of ASML's fourth-quarter net bookings. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet struck a positive note on the arrival of low-cost AI models such as DeepSeek, telling CNBC's Arjun Kharpal that he expects this development to drive more demand for semiconductors \u2014 not less. While he declined to comment on specifics with DeepSeek's R1, Fouquet said that he sees no sign of a slowdown in demand for AI-focused chips. \"A lower cost of AI could mean more applications. More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand,\" Fouquet said in an interview Wednesday.\nwatch now\nThere is \"a lot of discussion\" in the industry surrounding DeepSeek, but Fouquet said ASML hasn't heard from customers asking about the impact of the Chinese firm's model on chip demand. Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said that the earnings report offered \"reassurance to the market following the turmoil due to concerns around DeepSeek.\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that ASML's fourth-quarter results vindicate the view that the chip firm isn't \"overvalued\" or \"full of puff.\" ASML is Morningstar's top AI pick in Europe, he added. \"Genuinely, we think the numbers support the [investment] case and, actually, we think the shares are worth more like 850 (euros) \u2014 which, given the pullback you've seen in the last few weeks, offers a pretty good opportunity for investors,\" Field said Wednesday. ASML shares closed at 646.60 euros per share Tuesday.\nSlowdown in China demand\nFouquet added that ASML's expecting a rebalancing of demand in China in 2025. Over the past two years, ASML saw heightened demand for its chipmaking tools in the country as Chinese firms stocked up to get ahead of U.S. restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor machines.\nwatch now\n\"We had a huge backlog in China, at the end of 2022, because 2022 was a year we couldn't feed the market with all the tools the market needed. This has kind of been absorbed last year,\" Fouquet told CNBC. He added that ASML expects to return to a more \"normal\" demand ratio in China, compared with other markets this year. \"We expect the ratio of our business in China to be lower than what it has been for sure in 23, 24,\" Fouquet added.\"\n\nResponse:",
