Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The storefront has been replaced with an error message that reads, \"This store is unavailable.\"\nThe rapper ran an advertisement on Sunday during the Super Bowl that directed viewers to visit Yeezy.com, where it promoted a single product \u2014 a $20 t-shirt with a black swastika. The site was online until Tuesday morning.\nShopify has taken down a site advertised by rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, that sold swastika t-shirts.\nFinkelstein called the site, which previously sold a broader selection of t-shirts, pants and jackets, \"disappointing.\"\n\"I'm a proud Jewish entrepreneur,\" Finkelstein told CNBC's Sara Eisen. \"I'm a proud Jewish community member. You and I have talked about this in the past, that it's a big part of my identity. So obviously I'm devastated by that.\"\nIn the days leading up to the Super Bowl, Ye had shared posts praising Adolf Hitler and calling himself a Nazi on the social media site X, which is owned by Elon Musk. On Monday, his account on X was deactivated. His profile now reads: \"This account doesn't exist.\"\nThe brief Super Bowl ad showed Ye reclining in a dentist's chair. \"I spent, like, all the money for the commercial on these new teeth,\" he said. Ye then tells viewers to \"go to yeezy.com.\"\nThe Anti-Defamation League condemned the commercial on Monday, writing in a post on X that \"there's no excuse for this kind of behavior.\"\nYe has previously been rebuked for making antisemitic comments, losing partnerships in 2022 with Gap and Adidas .\nIn 2022, Ye was suspended from X after he posted an image of a swastika merged with the Star of David, a prominent symbol of Judaism. Months later, his account was reinstated, a decision the company reportedly made after it received reassurances from Ye that he wouldn't use the platform to share antisemitic content, according to The Wall Street Journal.\nMusk, who acquired X, then known as Twitter, in 2022, has been embroiled in controversy over his own social media posts and activity. Musk has frequently amplified antisemitic posts on X, causing some advertisers to flee the site.\nIn December, Musk endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany party. And last month, Musk attracted backlash after he repeatedly used a gesture at a rally for Trump that was viewed by many historians and politicians as a Nazi salute. Musk later made jokes about it using the names of historical Nazi party figures.\n\ntitle1:\nAnduril to take over Microsoft's $22 billion U.S. Army headset program\ndescription1:\nPalmer Luckey, founder of Oculus and Anduril Industries, speaks during The Wall Street Journal's WSJ Tech Live conference in Laguna Beach, California on October 16, 2023.\nAnduril Industries, Palmer Luckey's defense-tech startup, will take over Microsoft 's multibillion-dollar augmented reality headset program with the U.S. Army, the companies announced Tuesday.\nThe partnership still needs approval from the Department of Defense. If that goes through, Anduril would oversee \"production, future development of hardware and software, and delivery timelines\" for the U.S. Army's Integrated Visual Augmentation System program, the companies said.\nThe IVAS program is intended to improve capabilities such as night vision for U.S. Army soldiers. Microsoft won a 10-year contract worth nearly $22 billion to build more than 120,000 custom HoloLens headsets for the Army in 2021, but the company discontinued production of the device last year, according to reports. As part of the new agreement, Microsoft will continue to provide cloud and artificial intelligence capabilities for IVAS.\nThe hand-off of the program comes at a key time for Anduril.\nThe startup has been in talks to raise up to $2.5 billion in funding at a $28 billion valuation, CNBC reported Friday. Anduril also unveiled a partnership with OpenAI in December, and in January, the startup announced plans to invest roughly $1 billion in a manufacturing facility in Ohio.\nSince its founding in 2017, Anduril has been working to shake up the defense contractor space currently dominated by Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman . Anduril has been a member of the CNBC Disruptor 50 list three times and ranked as No. 2 last year.\nLuckey founded Anduril after his ousting from Facebook. He joined the social media company after co-founding Oculus VR, a virtual reality startup that he sold to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014.\nHe was also one of the tech industry's earliest vocal supporters of President Donald Trump. Luckey told CNBC in 2017 that he's been on the \"tech-for-Trump train for longer than just about anyone\" and that the \"need to be the strongest military in the world is really non-partisan.\"\nLuckey called Anduril's IVAS partnership \"deeply personal\" and said everything in his career \"has led to this moment.\"\n\"IVAS isn't just another product,\" he wrote in a blog post. \"It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine how technology supports those who serve.\"\n\u2014 CNBC's Ari Levy and Morgan Brennan contributed reporting.\nWATCH: Anduril reportedly in talks to raise new funding round that could double valuation\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft powers AI ambitions with 400 MW solar purchase\ndescription2:\nMicrosoft has added another 389 megawatts of renewable power to its portfolio as the tech giant scrambles to meet the power demands required to match its AI ambitions.\nThe additional renewable power spans three solar projects developed by EDP Renewables North America \u2014 two in southern Illinois and one outside Austin, Texas. Microsoft is buying a mix of electricity to feed its nearby operations and renewable energy credits to cover demand elsewhere.\nMicrosoft contracts nearly 20 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity, according to the company\u2019s 2024 sustainability report. This latest purchase adds around 2% to the tally.\nThe tech giant has been procuring power at a rapid clip to feed its cloud and AI operations. Like many of its peers, Microsoft has embraced renewable power, in part because wind and solar can be deployed quickly and cheaply.\nSolar is especially speedy. While new gas power plants take years to build and commission, a new solar farm can start producing power in as few as 18 months. Developers have been planning projects that can be commissioned in phases, allowing them to provide data centers with electricity as quickly as possible.\nTo enable power 24 hours a day, seven days a week, some renewable developers are turning to hybrid installations. Solar and wind are connected to one or more types of batteries, which are charged when renewable power flows and discharged when it ebbs. Last week, Amazon signed a contract with one such development in Portugal.\nRenewable energy purchases allow Microsoft to power its core operations without producing pollution. It may also help Microsoft meet its pledge to become carbon negative by 2030. To hit the target, Microsoft will have to sequester and store more carbon than its operations produce.\nTo reach negative emissions, Microsoft has also invested in various forms of carbon removal, including direct air capture, enhanced rock weathering, and reforestation. Last month, Microsoft announced a deal with Chestnut Carbon to buy more than 7 million tons of carbon credits, enough to cover about half the tech company\u2019s emissions in 2023.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Now, the debate is underway over just how far the U.S. government should go in the future in blocking access to U.S. chip technology.\nPresident Biden's Department of Commerce issued its rules to \"regulate the global diffusion\" of AI chips and models in the administration's waning days. The rules already have been heavily criticized by tech companies, including Nvidia, as well as policy experts. A Brookings analysis argues the the AI diffusion rules seek to create \"a centrally planned global computing economy.\"\n\"A decade from now, we will look back and recognize how quixotic it was for the U.S. government of the mid-2020s to attempt to limit the ability of people in 150 countries to perform fast multiplications,\" wrote John Villasenor, a nonresident senior fellow at Brookings and professor of electrical engineering, law, public policy, and management at UCLA.\nIn any technology war, questions about what countermove the U.S. should make next inevitably run up against the awareness that any notion of controlling innovation through measures like restricting exports is not guaranteed to work \u2013 and may even backfire. Among the risks cited by Brookings: spurring the development of a global AI ecosystem anchored outside the U.S.; pushing more nations into building stronger technology ties with China; and allowing non-U.S. makers of advanced chips to grow global market share at the expense of the U.S. companies behind the original innovations.\n\"I worry that we will have a knee-jerk response to ratchet up controls heavily, before we fully think through the trade-offs,\" said Martin Chorzempa, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nThere is a 120-day comment period that ends on May 15 on the AI diffusion rules, unless Trump reverses or revises the rule before then. While the president has spoken in general about the need to protect the U.S. technological lead, he has not specifically addressed this rule. It's unknown what stance the current administration will take \u2013 expanding, curtailing, or overturning chip export rules already in place.\nVice President JD Vance said at an AI summit in Europe on Monday that the U.S. will safeguard its AI and chips, and block efforts to \"weaponize\" them.\n\"Some authoritarian regimes have stolen and used AI to strengthen their military intelligence and surveillance capabilities, capture foreign data and create propaganda to undermine other nations' national security,\" Vance said in an address at France's AI Action Summit in Paris. \"I want to be clear, this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American AI and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to adversaries attaining AI capabilities that threaten all of our people,\" he added.\nTrump's first-day signing of an executive order to \"identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls,\" suggest he could take a hard line. It said the government will \"assess and make recommendations regarding how to maintain, obtain, and enhance our Nation's technological edge and how to identify and eliminate loopholes in existing export controls \u2013 especially those that enable the transfer of strategic goods, software, services, and technology to countries to strategic rivals and their proxies.\"\nThe tech sector was quick to do its outreach to the new administration, with several major CEOs at the inauguration, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang meeting with President Trump at the White House in recent weeks for a discussion that included chip restrictions to China.\nTrump also called Deepseek a \"wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win.\"\n\ntitle4:\nAffirm partners with FIS on Buy Now, Pay Later debit cards\ndescription4:\nPayPal Inc. co-founder and Affirm\u2019s CEO Max Levchin on center stage during day one of Collision 2019 at Enercare Center in Toronto, Canada.\nAffirm , the online lender founded by Max Levchin, expanded beyond credit and entered the debit market four years ago with a card that let users pay over time. Now the company is making it possible for banks to offer that service to their customers.\nAffirm, which pioneered the buy now, pay later business (BNPL), has partnered with FIS in a deal that will allow the fintech company to offer the pay-over-time service to its banking clients and their millions of individual customers.\nAny bank that partners with FIS will be able to provide its own version of the Affirm Card, which launched in 2021, without asking customers to adopt a new piece of plastic. Consumers can access Affirm's biweekly and monthly installment plans and have the money automatically deducted from their checking account.\nThere are approximately 230 million debit card users in the U.S., according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. BNPL services have traditionally been tied to credit cards or standalone financing products, rather than to debit offerings.\"\n\nResponse:",
