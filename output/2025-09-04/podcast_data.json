Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday September 5), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nStripe enlists a who\u2019s who, including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Paradigm, to build a new blockchain\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nStripe is funding a new blockchain company called Tempo, co-founder CEO Patrick Collison announced on Thursday. Tempo is aimed at high-volume processing of stablecoins \u2014 coins that help reduce crypto\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. That\u2019s not surprising given that Stripe acquired stablecoin company Bridge.\nWhat is surprising is the eye-popping list of companies Stripe has already enlisted: Anthropic, Coupang, Deutsche Bank, DoorDash, Lead Bank, Mercury, Nubank, OpenAI, Revolut, Shopify, Standard Chartered, and Visa. So if the blockchain works well, these design partners should be queued up to use or offer it for everything from agentic payments to remittances.\nPlus, Stripe board member Matt Huang, co-founder of one of the most prestigious crypto VC firms, Paradigm, has signed on to lead Tempo. Paradigm has also invested. Collison says Tempo will be run as an independent company.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI announces AI-powered hiring platform to take on LinkedIn\ndescription1:\nOpenAI says it\u2019s developing an AI-powered hiring platform to connect businesses and employees, a service that would put the outfit in close competition with LinkedIn. The product is called the OpenAI Jobs Platform, and the company expects to launch the service by mid-2026, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nOpenAI CEO of Applications Fidji Simo announced the new endeavor in a blog post Thursday, saying the company will \u201cuse AI to help find the perfect matches between what companies need and what workers can offer.\u201d Simo said the service would offer a dedicated track for small businesses and local governments to access top AI talent.\nOpenAI is interested in expanding into several new markets beyond its core consumer offering, ChatGPT. At a recent dinner with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that Simo would oversee several applications beyond the chatbot. This will apparently include the OpenAI Jobs Platform and potentially other offerings OpenAI is reportedly working on, such as a browser and a social media app.\nNotably, OpenAI\u2019s hiring platform could put the company in direct competition with LinkedIn, which was co-founded by Reid Hoffman, one of OpenAI\u2019s earliest investors. LinkedIn is also owned by Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s largest financial backer.\nIn the last year, LinkedIn has worked to infuse its platform with AI features to help match job candidates with businesses.\nOpenAI also says it will start offering certifications for people with different levels of \u201cAI fluency\u201d through its OpenAI Academy, an online program the company launched last year. An OpenAI spokesperson says the company plans to launch a pilot of OpenAI Certifications in late 2025.\nMany tech executives have raised concerns that AI will disrupt numerous traditional jobs. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has said that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs before 2030. In her blog post, Simo acknowledged that risk, saying OpenAI can\u2019t prevent that disruption. However, she says the company can do its part by helping people become fluent in AI and connecting them with companies that need their skills.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe ChatGPT maker says it\u2019s working with Walmart, one of the biggest private employers in the world, on its certification program and aims to certify 10 million Americans by 2030.\nOpenAI says it\u2019s launching these programs as part of its commitment to the White House\u2019s initiative to expand AI literacy. Altman and other Big Tech executives are meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday to discuss AI.\n\ntitle2:\nRivian makes its second small workforce cut of the year ahead of R2 SUV launch\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nRivian is laying off around 150 workers \u2014 its second small staff cut in a matter of months \u2014 as the company readies itself for the all-important launch of its more-affordable R2 SUV next year.\nThe company confirmed to TechCrunch that the new cuts were mostly to its \u201ccommercial\u201d team, which deals with sales and service operations, and that affected employees will be eligible for rehire and encouraged to apply for other open positions. The Wall Street Journal first reported the layoffs earlier Thursday.\nThe layoffs follow a similar cut of around 1% of its total workforce that TechCrunch first reported in late June. Those cuts targeted Rivian\u2019s manufacturing team.\nRivian has made repeated workforce adjustments over the last two years. It laid off around 10% of its staff in early 2024 and made another small cut in April 2024. The company started this year with approximately 15,000 employees worldwide.\n\ntitle3:\nBret Taylor's Sierra raises $350M at a $10B valuation\ndescription3:\nInvestors are clearly bullish about former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor\u2019s AI agent startup Sierra.\nSierra, which helps enterprises build customer service AI agents, announced it raised a $350 million funding round on Thursday. The round, led by earlier investor Greenoaks Capital, values the startup at $10 billion, according to a company blog post that confirmed an earlier report from Axios on Wednesday.\nSierra was founded in early 2024 by Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor. The company claims to have landed hundreds of customers, including SoFi, Ramp, and Brex, among others, in its 18 months of operation.\nSierra has now raised $635 million altogether, including $110 million that closed in February of last year led by Sequoia and Benchmark, and a $175 million round that closed in October of last year led by Greenoaks.\nOthers of its investors include ICONIQ and Thrive Capital.\nAs TechCrunch has previously reported, Taylor and Bavor have a long history in customer service tech. Taylor spent nearly a decade at Salesforce and years ago founded Quip, which Salesforce bought for $750 million in the summer of 2016. Bavor managed Gmail and Google Drive at Google, among other consumer-facing products.\nTaylor met Bavor while at Google, where he worked before serving as Facebook\u2019s CTO for several years. At Google, Taylor is widely credited with helping to launch Google Maps. Years later, he\u2019d oversee the Twitter board throughout Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the social media site.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nEarlier this week, in fact, Taylor announced that Sierra is launching its second year of its so-called APX program, a rotational opportunity for recent technical graduates that directly mirrors the Google program that launched both Taylor\u2019s and co-founder Clay Bavor\u2019s careers two decades ago.\nThe hiring announcement stands out in what has become an increasingly tough job market, particularly as companies assess the power of AI technologies like those Sierra is selling and their potential impact on workforce needs.\nThe program targets computer science graduates and says it offers experience in both agent engineering and product management. Taylor described the roles as providing what he calls \u201can irresponsible amount of responsibility\u201d \u2014 similar to the freedom to build and launch products that he and Bavor had at Google \u2014 with new graduates expected to work on multiple product launches during their first year.\n\ntitle4:\nX's encrypted DM feature, XChat, is rolling out more broadly\ndescription4:\nX\u2019s long-awaited encrypted DM feature, XChat, is becoming more widely available.\nThough the feature shipped in beta in May, XChat is now accessible for more users, including those who do not subscribe to X Premium.\nSeparate from the existing DM inbox, XChat is end-to-end encrypted. The chat system supports media uploads, group chats, pinned messages, and the ability to mark messages as read or unread. Vanishing mode has been rumored to be in the works as well.\nRight now, users can only access XChat if they opt into using it. On desktop, XChat is accessible to some users from the messages tab. There, you can navigate to \u201cChat\u201d from a menu option that appears above \u201cMessage requests.\u201d On mobile, \u201cChat\u201d appears in the main nav bar on the left, just above Communities.\nBefore using XChat, you have to set a four-digit code to protect your messages, similar to other encrypted platforms like Signal. It is only after setting the code that you can begin messaging other users who have also opted in.\nAs it stands, XChat is not a complete replacement of the longstanding DM system. Instead, those messages now appear under a tab that says \u201cunencrypted\u201d in the chat menu.\"\n\nResponse:",
