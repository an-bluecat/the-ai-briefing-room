Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

CNBC reported in November that xAI was aiming for a $50 billion valuation \u2014 double its valuation of six months prior.\nAccording to the Financial Times, only investors who\u2019d backed xAI in its previous fundraising round were permitted to participate in this one. Reportedly, investors who helped finance Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition were given access to up to 25% of xAI\u2019s shares.\nRamping up AI\nMusk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, a flagship generative AI model that now powers a number of features on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium subscribers and free users in some regions.\nGrok has what Musk has described as \u201ca rebellious streak\u201d \u2014 a willingness to answer \u201cspicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.\u201d Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won\u2019t hear from ChatGPT.\nMusk has derided ChatGPT and other AI systems for being too \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d despite Grok\u2019s own unwillingness to cross certain boundaries and hedge on political subjects. He\u2019s also referred to Grok as \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d and less biased than competing models, although there\u2019s evidence to suggest that Grok leans to the left.\nOver the past year, Grok has become increasingly ingrained in X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. At launch, Grok was only available to X users \u2014 and developers skilled enough to get the \u201copen source\u201d edition up and running.\nThanks to an integration with the open image generator Flux, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). The model can analyze images as well, and summarize news and trending events (imperfectly, mind).\nReports indicate that Grok may handle even more X functions in the future, from enhancing X\u2019s search capabilities and account bios to helping with post analytics and reply settings.\nxAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. The company launched an API in October, allowing customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services. And it just launched a standalone Grok iOS app to a test audience.\nMusk asserts that it hasn\u2019t been a fair fight.\nIn a lawsuit filed against OpenAI and Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s close collaborator, attorneys for Musk accuse OpenAI of \u201cactively trying to eliminate competitors\u201d like xAI by \u201cextracting promises from investors not to fund them.\u201d OpenAI, Musk\u2019s counsel says, also unfairly benefits from Microsoft\u2019s infrastructure and expertise in what the attorneys describe as a \u201cde facto merger.\u201d\nYet Musk often says that X\u2019s data gives xAI a leg up compared to rivals. Last month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts.\nMusk, it\u2019s worth noting, was one of the original founders of OpenAI, and left the company in 2018 after disagreements over its direction. He\u2019s argued in previous suits that OpenAI profited from his early involvement yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all.\nAn xAI ecosystem\nxAI has outlined a vision according to which its models would be trained on data from Musk\u2019s various companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and its models could then improve technology across those companies. It is already powering customer support features for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink internet service, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the startup is said to be in talks with Tesla to provide R&D in exchange for some of the carmaker\u2019s revenue.\nTesla shareholders, for one, object to these plans. Several have sued Musk over his decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what\u2019s essentially a competing venture.\nNevertheless, the deals \u2014 and xAI\u2019s developer and consumer-facing products \u2014 have driven xAI\u2019s revenue to around $100 million a year. For comparison, Anthropic is reportedly on pace to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, and OpenAI is targeting $4 billion by the end of 2024.\nMusk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which was apparently built in just 122 days and is currently powered partly by portable diesel generators. The company hopes to upgrade the server farm, which contains 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, next year; in its press release, xAI said it plans to fully double that number. (Because of their ability to perform many calculations in parallel, GPUs are the favored chips for training and running models.)\nIn November, xAI won approval from the regional power authority in Memphis for 150MW of additional power \u2014 enough to power roughly 100,000 homes. To win the agency over, xAI pledged to improve the quality of the city\u2019s drinking water and provide the Memphis grid with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries. But some residents criticized the move, arguing it would strain the grid and worsen the area\u2019s air quality.\nTesla is also expected to use the upgraded data center to improve its autonomous driving technologies.\nxAI has expanded quite rapidly from an operations standpoint in the year since its founding, growing from just a dozen employees in March 2023 to over 100 today. In October, the startup moved into OpenAI\u2019s old corporate offices in San Francisco\u2019s Mission neighborhood.\nxAI has reportedly told investors it plans to raise more money next year.\nIt won\u2019t be the only AI lab raising immense cash. Anthropic recently secured $4 billion from Amazon, bringing its total raised to $13.7 billion, while OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October to grow its war chest to $17.9 billion.\nMegadeals like OpenAI\u2019s and Anthropic\u2019s drove AI venture capital activity to $31.1 billion across over 2,000 deals in Q3 2024, per PitchBook data.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

China's tech giants have launched their own AI models.\nThe so-called Section 301 investigation will look into China's \"acts, policies, and practices on the production of silicon carbide substrates or other wafers used as inputs into semiconductor fabrication,\" the White House added.\nChina \"routinely engages in non-market policies and practices, as well as industrial targeting\" of the chip industry, which allows Chinese firms \"to significantly harm competition and create dangerous supply chain dependencies in foundational semiconductors,\" the White House said in a statement.\nThe Biden administration on Monday said it launched a new probe into legacy Chinese semiconductors that may go into everything from cars to household goods and defense systems.\nOverall, Washington's probe looks to assess the U.S. dependency on legacy Chinese chips in areas spanning everything from telecommunications to the electrical grid.\nThe new investigation marks an escalation of U.S. pressure on China's semiconductor industry. To date, many of the actions taken by Washington have sought to target the most cutting-edge chips, in particular those used in the booming artificial intelligence sector.\nSo-called legacy chips are produced with less advanced manufacturing technique. Chinese manufacturers of chips still remain generations behind industry leaders like TSMC, but they are able to produce legacy chips at scale.\nThe latest investigation into Chinese legacy chips is being conducted under the Trade Act of 1974. One potential remedy that can be imposed under this law is placing tariffs on the products in question.\nThe Biden administration has continued to target China's tech sector this year with increased import tariffs on products from electric vehicles to semiconductors. The latest action comes just weeks before the incumbent U.S. president hands over the reins to Donald Trump.\nReuters, citing Biden administration officials, reported on Monday that the probe into legacy chips will be handed over to Trump's administration to complete.\n\ntitle2:\nHonda and Nissan plan major merger focused on 'intelligence and electrification'\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nJapanese car giants Honda and Nissan are working out the details of a major merger that could create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker, as the companies look to survive in an industry faced with uncertainty.\nThe Tesla-led shift toward electric vehicles, and China\u2019s increased importance in the automotive market, have companies like Honda and Nissan feeling the pressure to compete. If they go through with the merger, it could be completed by 2026. Nissan\u2019s partner company Mitsubishi is supposed to decide by the end of January 2025 whether it would join this new alliance.\nNissan and Mitsubishi are already in a partnership with French automaker Renault, though that relationship has grown increasingly fraught \u2014 especially after former chairman of the alliance, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in Japan on allegations of financial misconduct and subsequently fled the country. \u201cAs the main shareholder of Nissan, Renault Group will consider all options based on the best interest of the Group and its stakeholders,\u201d a spokesperson for Renault said in a statement.\n\ntitle3:\nTrump taps Silicon Valley execs for key administration roles\ndescription3:\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is tapping tech heavyweights to join his new administration, continuing a trend of Silicon Valley's growing influence in a second Trump White House.\nTrump said Sunday he would nominate Scott Kupor, a managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz, to be director of the Office of Personnel Management, which coordinates recruitment and provides resources for government employees.\nKupor thanked Trump in a post on X and said the opportunity would allow him to work with Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in their leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nascent commission aimed at cutting government spending and regulation.\nTrump also picked Sriram Krishnan as senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Krishnan, who most recently served as a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, has had a long career in tech, with roles at Microsoft , Meta , Twitter, Snap and Yahoo. He has previous ties to Musk, helping him \"temporarily\" run the social media service X after Musk acquired the platform, formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion in 2022.\nMusk, a tech billionaire who was one of Trump's top donors and most vocal supporters during his campaign, has emerged as one of the president-elect's closest advisors. His outsized influence over Trump has led to growing consternation among Democrats, foreign leaders and business executives, some of whom compete with Musk's companies. Along with X, Musk runs vehicle maker Tesla , defense contractor SpaceX and brain tech startup Neuralink.\nKrishnan will likely work closely with David Sacks, another tech executive who has a long history with Musk. Trump earlier this month named Sacks \u2014 a venture capitalist, former PayPal COO and popular podcaster \u2014 as \"czar\" of crypto and AI.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI's o3 suggests AI models are scaling in new ways - but so are the costs\ndescription4:\nLast month, AI founders and investors told TechCrunch that we\u2019re now in the \u201csecond era of scaling laws,\u201d noting how established methods of improving AI models were showing diminishing returns. One promising new method they suggested could keep gains was \u201ctest-time scaling,\u201d which seems to be what\u2019s behind the performance of OpenAI\u2019s o3 model \u2014 but it comes with drawbacks of its own.\nMuch of the AI world took the announcement of OpenAI\u2019s o3 model as proof that AI scaling progress has not \u201chit a wall.\u201d The o3 model does well on benchmarks, significantly outscoring all other models on a test of general ability called ARC-AGI, and scoring 25% on a difficult math test that no other AI model scored more than 2% on.\nOf course, we at TechCrunch are taking all this with a grain of salt until we can test o3 for ourselves (very few have tried it so far). But even before o3\u2019s release, the AI world is already convinced that something big has shifted.\nThe co-creator of OpenAI\u2019s o-series of models, Noam Brown, noted on Friday that the startup is announcing o3\u2019s impressive gains just three months after the startup announced o1 \u2014 a relatively short time frame for such a jump in performance.\nWe announced @OpenAI o1 just 3 months ago. Today, we announced o3. We have every reason to believe this trajectory will continue. pic.twitter.com/Ia0b63RXIk \u2014 Noam Brown (@polynoamial) December 20, 2024\n\u201cWe have every reason to believe this trajectory will continue,\u201d said Brown in a tweet.\nAnthropic co-founder Jack Clark said in a blog post on Monday that o3 is evidence that AI \u201cprogress will be faster in 2025 than in 2024.\u201d (Keep in mind that it benefits Anthropic \u2014 especially its ability to raise capital \u2014 to suggest that AI scaling laws are continuing, even if Clark is complementing a competitor.)\nNext year, Clark says the AI world will splice together test-time scaling and traditional pre-training scaling methods to eke even more returns out of AI models. Perhaps he\u2019s suggesting that Anthropic and other AI model providers will release reasoning models of their own in 2025, just like Google did last week.\nTest-time scaling means OpenAI is using more compute during ChatGPT\u2019s inference phase, the period of time after you press enter on a prompt. It\u2019s not clear exactly what is happening behind the scenes: OpenAI is either using more computer chips to answer a user\u2019s question, running more powerful inference chips, or running those chips for longer periods of time \u2014 10 to 15 minutes in some cases \u2014 before the AI produces an answer. We don\u2019t know all the details of how o3 was made, but these benchmarks are early signs that test-time scaling may work to improve the performance of AI models.\nWhile o3 may give some a renewed belief in the progress of AI scaling laws, OpenAI\u2019s newest model also uses a previously unseen level of compute, which means a higher price per answer.\n\u201cPerhaps the only important caveat here is understanding that one reason why O3 is so much better is that it costs more money to run at inference time \u2014 the ability to utilize test-time compute means on some problems you can turn compute into a better answer,\u201d Clark writes in his blog. \u201cThis is interesting because it has made the costs of running AI systems somewhat less predictable \u2014 previously, you could work out how much it cost to serve a generative model by just looking at the model and the cost to generate a given output.\u201d\nClark, and others, pointed to o3\u2019s performance on the ARC-AGI benchmark \u2014 a difficult test used to assess breakthroughs on AGI \u2014 as an indicator of its progress. It\u2019s worth noting that passing this test, according to its creators, does not mean an AI model has achieved AGI, but rather it\u2019s one way to measure progress toward the nebulous goal. That said, the o3 model blew past the scores of all previous AI models which had done the test, scoring 88% in one of its attempts. OpenAI\u2019s next best AI model, o1, scored just 32%.\nChart showing the performance of OpenAI\u2019s o-series on the ARC-AGI test. Image Credits:ARC Prize\nBut the logarithmic x-axis on this chart may be alarming to some. The high-scoring version of o3 used more than $1,000 worth of compute for every task. The o1 models used around $5 of compute per task, and o1-mini used just a few cents.\nThe creator of the ARC-AGI benchmark, Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, writes in a blog that OpenAI used roughly 170x more compute to generate that 88% score, compared to high-efficiency version of o3 that scored just 12% lower. The high-scoring version of o3 used more than $10,000 of resources to complete the test, which makes it too expensive to compete for the ARC Prize \u2014 an unbeaten competition for AI models to beat the ARC test.\nHowever, Chollet says o3 was still a breakthrough for AI models, nonetheless.\n\u201co3 is a system capable of adapting to tasks it has never encountered before, arguably approaching human-level performance in the ARC-AGI domain,\u201d said Chollet in the blog. \u201cOf course, such generality comes at a steep cost, and wouldn\u2019t quite be economical yet: You could pay a human to solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly $5 per task (we know, we did that), while consuming mere cents in energy.\u201d\nIt\u2019s premature to harp on the exact pricing of all this \u2014 we\u2019ve seen prices for AI models plummet in the last year, and OpenAI has yet to announce how much o3 will actually cost. However, these prices indicate just how much compute is required to break, even slightly, the performance barriers set by leading AI models today.\nThis raises some questions. What is o3 actually for? And how much more compute is necessary to make more gains around inference with o4, o5, or whatever else OpenAI names its next reasoning models?\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like o3, or its successors, would be anyone\u2019s \u201cdaily driver\u201d like GPT-4o or Google Search might be. These models just use too much compute to answer small questions throughout your day such as, \u201cHow can the Cleveland Browns still make the 2024 playoffs?\u201d\nInstead, it seems like AI models with scaled test-time compute may only be good for big picture prompts such as, \u201cHow can the Cleveland Browns become a Super Bowl franchise in 2027?\u201d Even then, maybe it\u2019s only worth the high compute costs if you\u2019re the general manager of the Cleveland Browns, and you\u2019re using these tools to make some big decisions.\nInstitutions with deep pockets may be the only ones that can afford o3, at least to start, as Wharton professor Ethan Mollick notes in a tweet.\nO3 looks too expensive for most use. But for work in academia, finance & many industrial problems, paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars for a successful answer would not be we prohibitive. If it is generally reliable, o3 will have multiple use cases even before costs drop \u2014 Ethan Mollick (@emollick) December 22, 2024\nWe\u2019ve already seen OpenAI release a $200 tier to use a high-compute version of o1, but the startup has reportedly weighed creating subscription plans costing up to $2,000. When you see how much compute o3 uses, you can understand why OpenAI would consider it.\nBut there are drawbacks to using o3 for high-impact work. As Chollet notes, o3 is not AGI, and it still fails on some very easy tasks that a human would do quite easily.\nThis isn\u2019t necessarily surprising, as large language models still have a huge hallucination problem, which o3 and test-time compute don\u2019t seem to have solved. That\u2019s why ChatGPT and Gemini include disclaimers below every answer they produce, asking users not to trust answers at face value. Presumably AGI, should it ever be reached, would not need such a disclaimer.\nOne way to unlock more gains in test-time scaling could be better AI inference chips. There\u2019s no shortage of startups tackling just this thing, such as Groq or Cerebras, while other startups are designing more cost-efficient AI chips, such as MatX. Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anjney Midha previously told TechCrunch he expects these startups to play a bigger role in test-time scaling moving forward.\nWhile o3 is a notable improvement to the performance of AI models, it raises several new questions around usage and costs. That said, the performance of o3 does add credence to the claim that test-time compute is the tech industry\u2019s next best way to scale AI models.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!
