 Senate passes a bill forcing TikTok to face a ban if ByteDance doesn't sell it
The Senate passed a bill, included with the foreign aid package, that will ban TikTok if its owner, ByteDance, doesn’t sell it within a year. Senators passed the bill 79-18 Tuesday after the House passed it with overwhelming majority over the weekend.
President Joe Biden will have to sign the bill to make it law, and as per a statement released by the White House, he intends to do so on Wednesday.
Notably, in March, the House passed a similar standalone bill to ban TikTok or force its sale with a six-month time limit. However, the Senate never took that bill up. This time, as the bill was tied with critical foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, the Senate had to make a decision.
TikTok didn’t immediately release a statement. However, Michael Beckerman, the company’s head of public policy for the Americas, said that the company plans to challenge the move in courts, according to Bloomberg.
“This is an unprecedented deal worked out between the Republican Speaker and President Biden. The stage that the bill is signed, we will move to the courts for a legal challenge,” he said in a memo to TikTok’s US staff earlier this week.
The bill gives Bytedance nine months to force a sale with a 90-day extension — so effectively a year to complete the deal.
Last week, when the House passed the bill, TikTok said it was “unfortunate” that the House was using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to jam through a ban bill that restricts the “free speech rights of 170 million Americans.”
It is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform… — TikTok Policy (@TikTokPolicy) April 18, 2024
While TikTok operates out of Singapore, the U.S. has been concerned about the data of its citizens, given the Chinese ownership of the social media platform. TikTok has continually tried to assure the government that it doesn’t give out U.S. user data to China with different campaigns.

Apple’s next iPad event is May 7
Apple just dropped an invite for its next event. Scheduled for May 7, the “Let Loose” presentation appears to be happening exclusively online — something that became standard fare for the company during the pandemic. Over the last couple of years, however, Apple has returned to in-person events, including WWDC, which kicks off in Cupertino on June 10.
If this one is, indeed, online only, it’s likely to be on the smaller side, focusing on one or two select products. The company is no doubt saving some bigger news for its developer conference, happening almost exactly a month later.
The artwork features a prominent image of a hand holding an Apple Pencil, accompanied by the apparently handwritten tagline, “Let Loose.” We’re way overdue for a new iPad or four, as the company hasn’t updated the tablet line since 2022. M2 and M3 chips are strong possibilities, heading to the iPad Pro and iPad Air models, respectively.
As for the Pencil, this month’s early iOS 17.5 beta includes a reference to a “squeeze” feature for the upcoming fourth-generation version of Apple’s stylus. Other rumored upgrades include an updated version of the Pro’s Magic Keyboard case.
The event kicks off May 7 at 7 a.m. PT. Stay tuned to TechCrunch for more info.

Tesla profits drop 55%, company says EV sales 'under pressure' from hybrids
Tesla profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter from the same year-ago period as a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and “several unforeseen challenges” cut into the automaker’s bottom line.
Tesla reported revenue of $21.3 billion in the first quarter, a 9% drop from the first quarter of 2023. Analysts polled by Yahoo Finance expected earnings of $0.51 per share on $22.15 billion in revenue. Tesla reported operating income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, a 54% decrease from the same year-ago period.
The company said in its Q1 earnings report that it experienced “numerous challenges” in the first quarter, including the Red Sea conflict and the arson attack at Gigafactory Berlin and the gradual ramp of the updated Model 3 at its factory in Fremont, California. Tesla also noted that global EV sales continue to be under pressure as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs. On the upside, that hybrid approach has meant automakers continue to buy regulatory credits; Tesla earned $442 million in zero emissions tax credits in the first quarter.
“The EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug in hybrids instead,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in opening remarks on the earnings call. “We believe this is not the right strategy, and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market.”
Shares pop on future promises
The results, posted after markets closed Tuesday, sent shares up as much as 12% following the release as investors appeared to be more focused on Tesla’s forward-looking remarks about future products, including an upended product roadmap to bring multiple cheaper vehicles to market by 2025.
Despite the downward trend in profits, Tesla used the first-quarter report to focus on the future, namely about using AI to make advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on a next-generation vehicle platform. The company spent $1.1 billion on research and development in the first quarter, a 49% increase from the same quarter in 2023.
Musk emphasized that despite the downward pressure, the company was focused on — and investing in — the future. Specifically, the company is accelerating work on a new vehicle lineup with production expected in early 2025, if not late this year, Musk said.
“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next-generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms,” he said. “And we’ll be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup.”
The cost of price cuts
Tesla has seen EV sales grow over the past several years, topping out to a new record of 1.8 million vehicles in 2023. But the company’s profits have suffered thanks to repeated price cuts that started in late 2022.
While those price cuts did provide a temporary bump in sales, it hasn’t had a lasting effect. Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter of 2024, down 20% from the 484,507 it delivered in the final quarter of 2023. This wasn’t just a quarter-over-quarter blip either; Tesla delivered 8.5% fewer cars than the first quarter of 2023. Automotive gross margins, excluding regulatory credits, shrank to 16.35% in the first quarter compared to 18.96% in the same year-ago period.
Tesla warned in January that growth of its vehicle sales “may be notably lower” in 2024, noting at that time it was between “two major growth waves” and prepping for the launch of a new vehicle platform to build a smaller EV that costs around $25,000. The company has also been prepping a “robotaxi” built on the same platform. In the meantime, Tesla’s only new model is the expensive (and fussy) Cybertruck; the company has launched new variants on existing models, including the Tesla Model 3 Performance.
Musk said during the company’s earnings call in January the smaller and cheaper EV would go into production in late 2025 at the company’s factory in Texas and eventually expand to a yet-to-be-built factory in Mexico.
Three months later, Musk appears to have changed the company’s low-cost EV playbook. Musk reportedly replaced the plan for a low-cost EV purpose-built on the new platform. Instead, he now wants to plow headlong into the robotaxi, which will be revealed in some capacity in August, while also launching “new models” that somehow use what’s being developed for that new platform.
Less than two weeks after announcing the robotaxi launch date, Musk oversaw a 10% reduction in headcount and a restructuring that puts autonomy in sharp focus. Two high-profile executives — Drew Baglino, Tesla’s SVP of Powertrain and Energy, and Rohan Patel, VP of Public Policy and Business Development — also left the company. Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tuesday during the earnings call that the savings generated from the workforce reduction is expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual basis.
Other revenue sources
While automotive revenues fell, there were gains in other parts of the business, notably energy storage.
The company reported that energy storage deployments increased to a record 4.1 GWh. That pushed revenue for energy generation (meaning solar) and storage to 1.6 billion in the first quarter, a 7% increase from the same quarter last year. Tesla noted that most of that growth came from increased Megapack deployments, which was partially offset by a decrease in solar installs.
The company also reported $2.28 billion in revenue from services, including capital generated from its Supercharger network. That revenue source should increase as more automakers, including Ford, GM, Rivian and VW adopt Tesla’s technology known as North American Charging Standard.
Tesla Semi delayed
While Tesla pushes forward on autonomy and a new product roadmap, other projects continue to be delayed. Mass production of the Tesla Semi, which was first revealed in November 2017, is now being pushed out another year.
The Tesla Semi, which was originally planned to go into production in 2019, has been repeatedly delayed. The company did reveal a production-ready Semi in December 2022 and delivered a handful to Pepsi, its first customer, for a pilot. But it has yet to scale up volume production.
Last June, Musk said the company wouldn’t begin producing the Class 8 big rig until the end of 2024. The first production Semi vehicles are now planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026, according to Tesla.
Tesla is finalizing the engineering for the Semi to allow for “super cost effective high production,” according to information shared on the call. The company shared in its first-quarter earnings report that it has started construction of a Tesla Semi factory near its so-called Gigafactory in Sparks, Nevada.

Perplexity is raising $250M+ at a $2.5B-$3B valuation for its AI search platform, sources say
Perplexity, the AI search engine startup, is a hot property at the moment. TechCrunch has learned that the company is currently raising at least $250 million more at a valuation of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion.
The news comes on the heels of two other big fundraises that have seen the company’s valuation leapfrog in the last four months: In January, the company raised nearly $74 million at a valuation of $540 million (up from $121 million in April 2023). And at the beginning of March, the company closed funding on a valuation of $1 billion, with CEO Aravind Srinivas clarifying on Twitter today that the amount raised was roughly $63 million.
Those two reported rounds are not the full story. We understand from multiple sources close to the company that Perplexity is raising a further round of at least $250 million to capitalize on the attention it’s getting in the market. NEA and IVP, both previous backers of the company, are among those looking to invest in this larger round, according to sources.
Whether they or other previous backers participate, a source said, may depend on how willing Perplexity is to work with existing investors rather than diversify, expanding its cap table to bring in new investors.
“They are growing very rapidly,” a partner from an existing investor said. “Yes we will look to participate.”
The core of Perplexity’s product is a generative AI-based search engine that provides results using a chatbot-style interface. It’s definitely not the only company in generative AI pursuing the search opportunity: That is essentially how many people are using products like ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Bing (powered by OpenAI), and Google is making a big push to improve search results with its Gemini LLM.
But Perplexity is building its algorithms incorporating a variety of LLMs, the idea being that this produces a more accurate and richer response.
Now it’s using these to build what it describes as a more advanced enterprise “pro” product, too.
“Unlike other enterprise tools for knowledge work like Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity Enterprise Pro is also the only enterprise AI offering that offers all the cutting-edge foundation models in the market in one single product: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude Opus, Mistral, and more to come,” CEO and co-founder Aravind Srinivas noted earlier today in a tweet promoting the new offering. “This gives customers and users choices to explore and customize their experience depending on their use cases.” That “more to come” may well be including more from Hugging Face and Meta, if Srinivas’s public endorsements and investor lists are anything to go by.
Considering that the company has only been around since 2022, Perplexity’s current investor list is already long, running to 46 names according to PitchBook data.
In addition to IVP and NEA, it includes other notable VCs such as Sequoia, Bessemer and Kindred; strategic backers like Nvidia, Databricks and Bezos Expeditions; and many recognizable individuals such as Jeff Bezos, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun, Naval Ravikant, Susan Wojcicki, Elad Gil, Nat Friedman and Clément Delangue from Hugging Face. A newer backer, Daniel Gross, led the $56 million round from March with other new backers Stanley Druckenmiller, Y Combinator head Garry Tan and Figma’s CEO Dylan Field also participating, among others.
One fundraise coming rapidly on the heels of another is reminiscent of rolling fundraising that we’ve seen from other big startups over the years. In the years leading up to its IPO during a time of rapid growth and major attention, Snap regularly appeared to be raising money on an ongoing basis. These days, it appears to be all about AI, with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral all raising at a rapid pace and seeing their valuations skyrocket along with that.
In the case of Perplexity, the startup is standing out in the market for a couple of reasons. Most obviously, it’s one of the ambitious, albeit smaller, hopefuls in the race to build generative AI services. Its unique position in the market is that it’s not focused on the race to build multipurpose large language models. Instead, taking a page from one of the biggest technology companies in the world today, it is tackling one specific product, at least for now: search.
Perplexity is not the only startup in AI that is building on very focused opportunities and by targeting enterprise. Synthesia in the U.K. is taking a similar approach with AI video tools, aiming them specifically at the business market, for the building of training and customer support video content.
In the case of Perplexity, the startup offers its tools on free and enterprise, paid tiers, and so far it has processed 75 million queries this year and is currently on ARR of $20 million, according to Bloomberg.
Its reason for raising again so soon? Yes, perhaps to capitalize on customer and investor interest at what one investor described as a “zeitgeist moment” for the startup. But also because of the mechanics of building any kind of AI service right now.
“Compute is very expensive, so they may need to raise” for that reason alone, one said.
We have reached out to Srinivas for comment and will update this post as we learn more.

Framework's repairability philosophy is set to expand beyond the laptop
Framework Computer was ahead of the curve. The company was founded in 2019, as 20 U.S. states began exploring potential right to repair bills. It delivered its first product, the Framework 13, in 2021, a year before New York enacted its landmark (if flawed) Digital Fair Repair Act.
Today, the company sells its repairable laptops in 13 countries across North America and Europe, along with Taiwan. Even so, Framework has been deliberate — cautious even — when it comes to raising. Its last major round was an $18 million Series A, closed in early 2022.
“When we closed a Series A round two years ago, we shared our strategy around fundraising, which is to raise as little as possible and focus funds on efficiently expanding the reach of our mission,” the company notes. “You can now see the results of that investment with Framework Laptop 16 out in customers’ hands.”
On Tuesday, the company announced a follow-up — a $17 million Series A-1. “We are a consumer company that’s not doing AI that successfully raised funding in 2024,” founder and CEO Nirav Patel tells TechCrunch, with a bit of a laugh.
There is, indeed, something oddly refreshing in a company that hasn’t shoehorned some unrelated bit of ChatGPT functionality into their pitch. Instead, Framework remains focused on its core business: user-repairable and upgradable laptops.
Patel is, however, quick to note, “fundamentally, we are a consumer electronics company, not a laptop company.” That simple clarification highlights a key element of this fundraising round. While generative AI might not be in the cards, an expanded portfolio certainly is. In addition to “scaling the reach” of its current offerings, this new funding will go toward “extending to additional product categories.” Patel did not disclose specifics.
The European firm Fairphone, which operates on a similar philosophy of consumer access, recently expanded its own portfolio. In addition to smartphones, the company now offers repairable headphones and earbuds. “We love what they’re doing,” Patel says of the kindred company. “It’s obviously a brutally competitive category that they’re in, and they’ve been doing quite well in it.”
Part of the funding will go toward hiring. Framework is planning to fill a total of 10 roles in 2024, adding to a headcount that is currently just under 50. In spite of that figure, the company maintains a wide international reach, including the brand new territory of Poland.
“It’s all direct to consumer,” says Patel. “We managed our go-to-market directly. We don’t deal with distributors or channels or retail, and we have this very, very short pipeline from warehouse to the consumer’s doorstep. That makes it operationally incredibly efficient. For the most part, we have a positive cash cycle, in the sense that we’re collecting money from the customers buying our product before we need to pay suppliers, in many cases.”
The round was led by Spark Capital and features Buckley Ventures, Anzu Partners, Cooler Master and Pathbreaker Ventures. In addition to the $17 million, the company is opening up $1 million to equity crowdfunding through $10,000 investments.
“It’s a little bit of an experiment,” says Patel. “We’re bringing in 100 investors, and probably for the most part, the vast majority of them are not going to be professional investors. This might even be the only private company investment any of them have ever made. We’ll see what that’s like, having that 100-person community board.”

我是wall-e，这是您的ai简报。美国参议院通过了一项法案，如果字节跳动不出售tiktok，则将迫使tiktok面临禁令。该法案包含在对外援助包中，如果tiktok的所有者字节跳动不在一年内出售，将禁止tiktok。参议院在周二以79-18的票数通过了该法案，此前众议院在周末以压倒性多数通过了它。根据白宫发布的声明，总统乔·拜登将于周三签署该法案，使其成为法律。值得注意的是，今年3月，众议院通过了一项类似的单独法案，以禁止tiktok或强制其出售，并规定了六个月的时限。然而，参议院从未审议过那项法案。这一次，由于该法案与对乌克兰、以色列和台湾的关键外援捆绑在一起，参议院不得不做出决定。tiktok没有立即发布声明。不过，该公司负责美洲地区公共政策的负责人迈克尔·贝克曼根据彭博社的报道表示，公司计划在法院挑战这一举措。

与此同时，苹果刚刚发布了下一次活动的邀请。预定于5月7日的“释放潜能”活动似乎将完全在线上进行——这在疫情期间成为该公司的标准做法。不过，在过去的几年里，苹果已经回归到了面对面的活动，包括将于6月10日在库比蒂诺开始的wwdc。如果这确实是一场仅在线上进行的活动，那么很可能会比较小规模，专注于一两个特定的产品。毋庸置疑，公司无疑会为几乎正好一个月后发生的开发者大会保留一些更大的新闻。

特斯拉的利润下降了55%，公司表示电动汽车销售“受到混合动力汽车的压力”。特斯拉第一季度的利润从去年同期的11.3亿美元下降到了5.5亿美元，由于长期的电动汽车降价策略和“多个意外挑战”削弱了汽车制造商的利润。特斯拉在第一季度的收入为213亿美元，较2023年第一季度下降了9%。雅虎财经的分析师预期每股收益为0.51美元，收入为221.5亿美元。特斯拉在第一季度报告的营业收入为12亿美元，较去年同期下降了54%。

perplexity正在为其ai搜索平台筹集2.5亿美元以上，估值为25亿至30亿美元。perplexity是目前市场上的一个热门属性。techcrunch了解到，该公司目前正在筹集至少2.5亿美元的资金，估值在25亿至30亿美元之间。这一消息紧随公司过去四个月内两次大规模筹资之后，这两次筹资使公司的估值飙升：今年1月，该公司以5.4亿美元的估值筹集了近7400万美元（从2023年4月的1.21亿美元上涨）。而在3月初，该公司以10亿美元的估值完成了融资，ceo阿拉文德·斯里尼瓦斯今天在twitter上澄清，筹集的金额约为6300万美元。

framework的可维修性理念将超越笔记本电脑。framework computer走在曲线前面。该公司成立于2019年，当时美国有20个州开始探索潜在的维修权法案。它在2021年交付了其第一款产品，framework 13，比纽约通过其具有里程碑意义的（尽管有缺陷的）数字公平修理法案提前一年。如今，该公司在北美和欧洲的13个国家以及台湾销售其可维修的笔记本电脑。即便如此，当谈到筹资时，framework一直非常慎重——甚至可以说是谨慎的。它的上一轮主要融资是在2022年初完成的1800万美元a轮融资。
