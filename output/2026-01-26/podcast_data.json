Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The company said Monday the round was led by Lightspeed.\nRicursive says the system will be able to create its own silicon substrate layer and speed up AI chip improvements. Rinse and repeat to get to AGI, the founders say.\nThe Series A comes just two months since the company formally launched with a seed investment led by Sequoia. It has raised $335 million total, reports The New York Times.\nRicursive was founded by former Google researchers CEO Anna Goldie and CTO Azalia Mirhoseini. Their work on a novel reinforcement learning method for designing chip layouts, called AlphaChip, has been used in four generations of Google\u2019s TPU chip, the startup says.\nDST Global, Nvidia\u2019s venture capital arm NVentures, Felicis Ventures, 49 Palms Ventures, and Radical AI are also investors.\nRicursive is not to be confused with the similarly named startup Recursive, reportedly founded by well-known natural language processing neural networks researcher Richard Socher. That Recursive is also in talks to raise a giant round at a $4 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last week. And it is also working on AI systems that improve themselves.\nAnd these two are not the only new startups working on the concept. As TechCrunch previously reported, Naveen Rao\u2019s new AI hardware startup, named Unconventional AI, is also working on an intelligent substrate. In December it raised a $475 million seed round at a $4.5 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures, with participation from Lux Capital and DCVC.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle pays $68M to settle claims its voice assistant spied on users\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nGoogle agreed to pay $68 million to settle claims its voice assistant illegally spied on users to, among other things, serve them advertisements, Reuters reports.\nGoogle did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement of the class-action case, which accused the firm of \u201cunlawful and intentional interception and recording of individuals\u2019 confidential communications without their consent and subsequent unauthorized disclosure of those communications to third parties.\u201d The suit further claimed that \u201cinformation gleaned from these recordings was wrongly transmitted to third parties for targeted advertising and for other purposes.\u201d\nThe case centered on \u201cfalse accepts,\u201d wherein Google Assistant is alleged to have activated and recorded the user\u2019s communications even if they had not intentionally prompted it to do so with a wake word. TechCrunch reached out to Google for comment.\nAmericans have long suspected that their devices inappropriately spy on them. Those suspicions have led, increasingly, to claims of legal wrongdoing. In 2021, Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle claims its voice assistant, Siri, had recorded their conversations without a prompt from users.\nGoogle, like other tech giants, has faced other privacy-related litigation in recent years. Last year, the company agreed to pay $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle two lawsuits that claimed it had violated the state\u2019s data privacy laws.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta to test premium subscriptions on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp\ndescription2:\nMeta plans to test new subscriptions that give people access to exclusive features on it apps, the company told TechCrunch on Monday. The tech giant said the new subscriptions will unlock more productivity and creativity, along with expanded AI capabilities.\nIn the coming months, Meta said it will offer a premium experience on Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp that gives users access to special features and more control over how they share and connect, while keeping the core experiences free. Meta doesn\u2019t appear to be locked into one strategy, noting that it will test a variety of subscription features and bundles, and that each app subscription will have a distinct set of exclusive features.\nMeta also shared that it plans to scale Manus, an AI agent it recently acquired for a reported $2 billion, as part of its subscription plans.\nMeta is taking a two-fold approach to Manus. The company is going to integrate Manus into Meta products, while continuing to sell standalone subscriptions to businesses. Meta has already been spotted working on adding a shortcut to Manus AI on Instagram, according to a screenshot shared by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they\u2019re still under development.\nAdditionally, Meta plans to test subscriptions for AI features, such as Vibes video generation. Vibes is Meta\u2019s AI-powered short-form video experience built into the Meta AI app that lets people create and remix AI-generated videos. Although Vibes has been free since its launch last year, Meta now plans to offer freemium access to Vibes video creation, with the option to subscribe to unlock additional video creation opportunities each month.\nWhile it\u2019s unknown what the paid features on WhatsApp and Facebook will look like, Paluzzi notes that the new subscription on Instagram will let users create unlimited audience lists, the ability to see a list of followers who don\u2019t follow you back, and the option to view a Story without the poster seeing that you viewed it.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the new subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified. The tech giant says it\u2019s going to use what it learned from Meta Verified to evolve its subscription business to include more offerings it thinks everyday users, creators, and businesses will want.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nMeta Verified is aimed at content creators and businesses, as it comes with a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, impersonation protections, search optimization, exclusive stickers, and more. While these features aren\u2019t aimed at everyday users or non-creators, the new subscriptions will be designed for a broader audience.\nThe launch of additional subscriptions will allow Meta to generate more revenue; however, many users may be deterred by subscription fatigue. With so many paid services competing for monthly spending, Meta will have to offer a compelling product to get users to sign up for yet another subscription.\nSnap has proven there is a market for social media subscriptions, as its Snapchat+ offering continues to be a revenue driver. Snapchat+, which starts at $3.99 per month for exclusive features, has topped 16 million subscribers, more than doubling since early 2024.\nMeta says it plans to listen to its community of users and gather feedback as it starts rolling out the subscriptions in the coming months.\n\ntitle3:\nQualcomm backs SpotDraft to scale on-device contract AI with valuation doubling toward $400M\ndescription3:\nAs demand grows for privacy-first enterprise AI that can run without sending sensitive data to the cloud, SpotDraft has raised $8 million from Qualcomm Ventures in a strategic Series B extension to scale its on-device contract review tech for regulated legal workflows.\nThe extension values SpotDraft at around $380 million, the startup told TechCrunch, nearly double its $190 million post-money valuation following its $56 million Series B in February of last year.\nAcross regulated sectors, enterprises have moved quickly to test generative AI, but privacy, security, and data governance concerns continue to slow adoption for sensitive workflows \u2014 especially in legal, where contracts can include privileged information, intellectual property, pricing, and deal terms. Industry research has consistently flagged data security and privacy as key barriers to wider GenAI deployment in professional services, pushing vendors like SpotDraft to pursue architectures that keep core contract intelligence on the user\u2019s device rather than routing it through the cloud.\nAt Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Summit 2025, SpotDraft demonstrated its VerifAI workflow running end-to-end on Snapdragon X Elite-powered laptops, executing contract review and edits offline while keeping the document on the local machine. SpotDraft said internet connectivity is still required for login, licensing, and collaboration features, but contract review, risk scoring, and redlining can run fully offline without sending documents to the cloud.\nSpotDraft sees legal as an early proving ground for on-device enterprise AI, arguing that sensitive contracts often cannot be routed through external cloud models due to privacy, security, and compliance constraints.\n\u201cThe future of how enterprise AI is going to be \u2014 right now, there\u2019s got to be AI that is close to the document, which is privacy critical, latency sensitive, [and] legally sensitive, and those are the things that will move on device,\u201d said Shashank Bijapur (pictured above, left), co-founder and CEO of SpotDraft, in an interview.\nSpotDraft says VerifAI\u2019s on-device capability extends beyond simply generating summaries, with the tool designed to apply playbooks and recommendations directly inside Microsoft Word, the way legal teams already work. \u201cVerifAI will compare a contract against your guidelines, your playbooks, your prior policies,\u201d said Madhav Bhagat (pictured above, right), co-founder and CTO of SpotDraft.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nSpotDraft\u2019s VerifAI works in Microsoft Word Image Credits:SpotDraft\nBijapur told TechCrunch that the demand for on-device AI is emerging most clearly in tightly regulated sectors, including defense and pharma, where internal security reviews and data residency requirements can slow or block the use of cloud-based AI tools for sensitive documents.\nOn-device models have rapidly closed the gap with cloud-based systems, both in output quality and response times, Bhagat said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve come to a place where, in terms of eval, we are seeing as little as 5% difference between the frontier models, and some of these fine-tuned on device models,\u201d he said, adding that speeds on newer chips are now \u201cone-third of what we get in the cloud.\u201d\nSince its launch in 2017, SpotDraft said it has reached more than 700 customers, up from around 400 in February last year, and counts Apollo.io, Panasonic, Zeplin, and Whatfix among its users. The company said adoption is rising on its contract lifecycle management platform, with customers now processing over 1 million contracts annually, contract volumes growing 173% year-over-year, and nearly 50,000 monthly active users. It also expects 100% year-over-year revenue growth in 2026, after growing 169% in 2024 and posting a similar growth rate in 2025, though it did not share specific revenue figures.\nSpotDraft plans to use the new capital to deepen its product and AI capabilities and expand its enterprise presence across the Americas, the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and India, Bijapur said, adding that Qualcomm\u2019s involvement extends beyond financing into joint development and go-to-market efforts for on-device deployments. The startup\u2019s on-device workflow is currently available to a limited set of customers, and the founders expect it to expand more broadly as compatible AI PC hardware becomes more widely available.\nBengaluru- and New York-based SpotDraft said it has a team of 300-plus employees, including 15\u201320 in the U.S., where COO Akshay Verma is based, and four to five in the UK, with the rest of the workforce in Bengaluru.\nTo date, the startup has raised $92 million, including the latest Qualcomm Ventures investment. Its earlier investors include Vertex Growth Singapore, Trident Growth Partners, Xeed VC, Arkam Ventures, and Prosus Ventures.\n\ntitle4:\nYouTubers sue Snap for alleged copyright infringement in training its AI models\ndescription4:\nA group of YouTubers who are suing tech giants for scraping their videos without permission to train AI models has now added Snap to their list of defendants. The plaintiffs \u2014 internet content creators behind a trio of YouTube channels with roughly 6.2 million collective subscribers \u2014 allege that Snap has trained its AI systems on their video content for use in AI features like the app\u2019s \u201cImagine Lens,\u201d which allows users to edit images using text prompts.\nThe plaintiffs earlier filed similar lawsuits against Nvidia, Meta, and ByteDance over similar matters.\nIn the newly filed proposed class action suit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the YouTubers specifically call out Snap for its use of a large-scale, video-language dataset known as HD-VILA-100M, and others that were designed for only academic and research purposes. To use these datasets for commercial purposes, the plaintiffs claim Snap circumvented YouTube\u2019s technological restrictions, terms of service, and licensing limitations, which prohibit commercial use.\nThe suit is seeking statutory damages and a permanent injunction to stop the alleged copyright infringement going forward.\nThe case itself is being led by the creators behind the h3h3 YouTube channel, with 5.52 million subscribers, and the smaller golfing channels MrShortGame Golf and Golfholics.\nIt\u2019s now one of many lawsuits pitting content creators against AI model providers, which have included copyright disputes from publishers, authors, newspapers, user-generated content sites, artists, and more. It\u2019s also not the first case to hail from a YouTuber. According to the nonprofit organization Copyright Alliance, over 70 copyright infringement cases have been filed against AI companies.\nIn some cases, like one between Meta and a group of authors, a judge has ruled in favor of the tech giant. In others, like the case between Anthropic and a group of authors, the AI giant has settled with and paid out the plaintiffs to resolve their claims. Many cases are still in active litigation.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!
