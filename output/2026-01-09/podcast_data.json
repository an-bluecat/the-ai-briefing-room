Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.\nExisting reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they\u2019ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It\u2019s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta\u2019s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.\nThe deals are the result of a request for proposals that Meta issued in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.\nThe 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta\u2019s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.\nAs part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company went public via SPAC in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a large deal with data center operator Switch, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nIf Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup\u2019s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta\u2019s order.\nTerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours.\nThe company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.\nMeta did not disclose financial terms of the deals.\nThe power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest \u2014 electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid.\nCosts for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to $50 to $60 per megawatt-hour, while Oklo has said it is aiming for $80 to $130 per megawatt-hour. Those figures are for later power plants \u2014 the first examples are likely to cost more.\n\ntitle1:\nThe venture firm that ate Silicon Valley just raised another $15 billion\ndescription1:\nAndreessen Horowitz just announced the firm has raised a little more than $15 billion in new funding. The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia.\nThe firm, which employs many hundreds of people across five offices \u2014 three in California, plus New York and Washington, D.C. \u2014 has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice.\nThat newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for \u201cAmerican Dynamism\u201d (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It\u2019s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes.\nThe \u201cwhere it comes from\u201d question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio \u2014 the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history \u2014 the firm didn\u2019t respond. What we do know is that CalPERS invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z\u2019s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don\u2019t really align with the firm\u2019s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, lists Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings.\nThe Saudi connection isn\u2019t subtle. Back in 2023, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a \u201cstartup country,\u201d adding that \u201cSaudi has a founder; you don\u2019t call him a founder, you call him his royal highness.\u201d\nBut Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump\u2019s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an \u201cunpaid intern\u201d at Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration \u2014 not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z\u2019s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer.\nThis matters because a16z\u2019s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls \u201cAmerican Dynamism\u201d \u2014 a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory \u201cin something like 8 days\u201d in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThen there\u2019s the AI bet, which might be the firm\u2019s highest-risk, highest-reward play yet. a16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (Character.AI, among many other portfolio companies).\nThe firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There\u2019s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its portfolio includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there\u2019s less visibility into those numbers.\nIn a blog post published Friday morning, Horowitz writes that \u201cas the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.\u201d It\u2019s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z\u2019s mission as \u201censuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.\u201d\nWhether that happens remains to be seen. What\u2019s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money \u2014 $15 billion this time \u2014 to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That\u2019s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.\n\ntitle2:\nCES 2026: Everything revealed, from Nvidia\u2019s debuts to AMD\u2019s new chips to Razer\u2019s AI oddities\ndescription2:\nCES 2026 is winding down in Las Vegas, as the consumer tech industry and everyone swarming around it begin their return flights home. Over the past few days, we saw a slew of announcements from mainstays like Nvidia, Sony, and AMD, along with smaller companies and startups vying for attention through the Unveiled event (CES\u2019s showcase for new products) and across the show floor.\nAs has been the case for the past two years, AI was at the forefront of many companies\u2019 messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. This year, physical AI was particularly prominent, taking the place that agentic AI held last year as the show\u2019s buzzy topic. That focus on physical AI came alongside a big focus on robotics, with robots demonstrated all over the show and showcased in numerous press events.\nTo relive the reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground, you can go back in time via our live blog right here.

It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our senior AI editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.\nAnd Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as senior reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company\u2019s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

We started our list of what stood out to us as odd and noteworthy, but we\u2019re open to more suggestions!\nHighlights from CES breakout sessions\nCES isn\u2019t all hardware showcases and show floor attractions \u2014 there are plenty of additional industry panels and speakers drawing eyeballs. We kept tabs on a few notable highlights, ranging from Palmer Luckey pushing retro aesthetics, to why the \u201clearn once, work forever\u201d era may be over, to previews of the new Silicon Valley-based series \u201cThe Audacity,\u201d to the expansion of Roku\u2019s $3 streaming service, to All-In host Jason Calacanis putting a $25,000 bounty on an authentic Theranos device.\nFord\u2019s AI assistant debuts\nFord is launching its assistant in the company\u2019s app before a targeted 2027 release in its vehicles, with hosting managed by Google Cloud and the assistant itself built using off-the-shelf LLMs. As we noted in our coverage of the news, however, few details were offered around what drivers should expect from their experience with the assistant.\nCaterpillar, Nvidia partner on automated construction equipment\nAs part of the ever-present push for AI\u2019s impact on the physical world, Caterpillar and Nvidia announced a pilot program, \u201cCat AI Assistant,\u201d which was demonstrated at CES Wednesday. This system, coming to one of Caterpillar\u2019s excavator vehicles, is happening alongside another project to use Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse simulation resources to help with construction project planning and execution.\nHands-on with Clicks Communicator\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nOne of the buzziest reveals of the show is the debut phone from Clicks Technology, the $499 Communicator, which brings back BlackBerry vibes with its physical keyboard, plus a separate $79 slide-out physical keyboard that can be used with other devices.\nCheck out our full rundown from the show floor here, but the Communicator makes a good first impression, per Consumer Editor Sarah Perez:\n\u201cIn our hands-on test, the phone felt good to hold \u2014 not too heavy or light, and was easy to grip. Gadway told me the company settled on the device\u2019s final form after dozens of 3D-printed shapes. The winning design for the phone features a contoured back that makes it easy to pick up and hold.\n\u201cThe device\u2019s screen is also somewhat elevated off the body, and its chin is curved up to create a recess that protects the keys when you place it face down.\u201d\nLG\u2019s home robot CLOiD makes a sluggish first impression\nImage Credits:TechCrunch\nA big part of LG\u2019s CES presentation was dedicated to its robotics efforts, with home robot CLOiD as a prominent figurehead. And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? We\u2019ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek\u2019s impressions speak for themselves:\n\u201cUnfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn\u2019t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.\u201d\neufyMake UV printer is an Etsy maker\u2019s dream\nLong used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own. But the eufyMake E1 is set to launch for $2,299 later this year, which makes bulk printing on things like mugs, water bottles, and phone cases a bit more attainable for individuals. Lucas Ropek has more first impressions here.\nA new way to find and purchase office space\nMyCommuters has a novel take on creating office space by helping companies find locations that are beneficial to them and their employees. The platform pulls together different datasets to examine commute time, expenses, and other factors to identify an ideal spot for an office, not just the easiest thing to spot that\u2019s on the market.

Check out our full impressions here.\nBoston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots\nHyundai\u2019s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they\u2019re working with Google\u2019s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of the humanoid robot that was shown onstage. Transportation editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.\nAmazon\u2019s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you\u2019d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via their browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon\u2019s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.\nOn the Ring front, consumer reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.\nRazer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko\nIn the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions to a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.\nThen there\u2019s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We\u2019ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.\nLego Smart Bricks mark the company\u2019s first CES appearance\nLego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles, and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with both the debut sets having a Star Wars theme.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nIn December, the company inked a $200 million deal to bring its AI models to data cloud company Snowflake and its customers. Shortly after, it announced a multi-year partnership with the consulting firm Accenture.\nIn October, it signed a deal with consulting firm Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to the firm\u2019s 500,000 employees. That same month, Anthropic signed a deal with IBM to bring its AI models into the latter\u2019s products.\nThe race for AI enterprise dominance is clearly on, and Anthropic appears to be winning \u2014 so far at least.\nAnthropic holds 40% of enterprise AI market share, according to a December survey from Anthropic investor Menlo Ventures, and 54% of the market share for AI coding. Anthropic market share increased throughout last year. When Menlo\u2019s original survey came out in July, the company held a 32% market share for overall enterprise LLM use.\nGoogle launched its dedicated enterprise AI product, Gemini Enterprise, in October. At the time, the company touted that the product suite already had customers, including fintech Klarna, design software company Figma, and cruise line operator Virgin Voyages, among others.\nOpenAI launched its enterprise version of ChatGPT, ChatGPT Enterprise, in 2023. Recently, the company reportedly expressed deep concern in an internal memo that Google Gemini\u2019s success was starting to encroach on its business. Shortly after, the company released a report that said enterprise use of ChatGPT had surged 8x in the past year.\nA recent TechCrunch investor survey found that enterprise-focused VCs overwhelmingly think that 2026 will be the year that enterprises start to see a meaningful return on their investment into AI products.\nWhile Anthropic seems to be a clear favorite at the moment, this year will likely be telling of what the enterprise AI market \u2014 and its competitive landscape \u2014 will look like in the future.\n\ntitle4:\nX restricts Grok's image generation to paying subscribers only after drawing the world's ire\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nElon Musk\u2019s AI company has restricted Grok\u2019s controversial AI image-generation feature to only paying subscribers on X, after the tool invited heavy criticism from across the world for letting users generate sexualized and nude images of women and children.\nIn replies to users on Friday, Grok said only paying subscribers on X would be able to generate and edit images on the platform. Notably, these limits do not apply to the Grok app, which, at the time of publication was letting anyone generate pictures without having to pay for a subscription.\nInitially available to anyone with daily limits, Grok\u2019s image-generation feature allowed users to upload anyone\u2019s picture and ask it to edit it or generate a sexualized or nude version. What ensued was a veritable flood of non-consensual sexualized images of children, actors, models and prominent figures, drawing the ire of multiple nations.\nX and Musk have both publicly denounced the use of the tool to produce such images, writing that the company would stick to its policies against posting illegal content on the social media platform. \u201cAnyone using grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,\u201d Musk tweeted last week.\nThe U.K., the European Union, and India have all publicly denounced X and Grok for allowing such use of its capabilities. The EU on Thursday asked xAI to retain all documentation relating to the chatbot, and India\u2019s communications ministry last week ordered X to make immediate changes to stop the image-generation features from being misused or risk its safe harbor protections in the country. The U.K.\u2019s communications watchdog said it\u2019s been in touch with xAI over the issue as well.\"\n\nResponse:",
