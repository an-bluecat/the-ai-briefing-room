Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday May 5), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple and Anthropic reportedly partner to build an AI coding platform\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nApple and Anthropic are teaming up to build a \u201cvibe-coding\u201d software platform that will use generative AI to write, edit, and test code for programmers, Bloomberg reported on Friday.\nThe iPhone maker is planning to roll out the software internally, according to Bloomberg, but hasn\u2019t decided if it will launch it publicly. The system is a new version of Apple\u2019s programming software, Xcode, and relies on Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet model, according to the report.\nTo accelerate its AI efforts, Apple seems to be tapping a network of partners. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT already helps power the company\u2019s Apple Intelligence features, and Google\u2019s Gemini may be added as an alternative option in the future, Apple has indicated. Now Anthropic may help Apple write code internally.\nAmong developers, the latest Claude models from Anthropic are particularly popular for coding tasks, especially on vibe coding platforms such as Cursor and Windsurf.\n\ntitle1:\nAI chatbots are 'juicing engagement' instead of being useful, Instagram co-founder warns\ndescription1:\nInstagram co-founder Kevin Systrom says AI companies are trying too hard to \u201cjuice engagement\u201d by pestering their users with follow-up questions, instead of providing actually useful insights.\nSystrom said the tactics represent \u201ca force that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d comparing them to those used by social media companies to expand aggressively.\n\u201cYou can see some of these companies going down the rabbit hole that all the consumer companies have gone down in trying to juice engagement,\u201d he said at StartupGrind this week. \u201cEvery time I ask a question, at the end it asks another little question to see if it can get yet another question out of me.\u201d\nThe comments come amid criticism of ChatGPT for being too nice to users instead of directly answering their questions. OpenAI has apologized for the problem and blamed \u201cshort-term feedback\u201d from users for it.\nSystrom suggested that chatbots being overly engaging is not a bug but an intentional feature designed for AI companies to show off metrics like time spent and daily active users. AI companies should be \u201claser-focused\u201d on providing high-quality answers rather than moving metrics in the easiest way possible, he said.\nSystrom didn\u2019t name any specific AI companies in his remarks. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn response, OpenAI pointed TechCrunch to its user specs, which state that its AI model \u201coften does not have all of the information\u201d to provide a good answer and may ask for \u201cclarification or more details.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nBut unless questions are too vague or difficult to answer, the AI should \u201ctake a stab at fulfilling the request and tell the user that it could be more helpful with certain information,\u201d the specs read.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle will soon start letting kids under 13 use its Gemini chatbot\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nNext week, Google will begin allowing kids under 13 who have parent-managed Google accounts to use its Gemini chatbot, according to The New York Times.\nThe Times reports that Gemini will be available to kids whose parents use Family Link, a Google service that enables families to opt into various Google services for their child. A Google spokesperson told the publication that Gemini has specific guardrails for younger users and that the company won\u2019t use that data to train its AI.\nAs The Times notes, chatbot makers are racing to capture younger audiences as the AI race heats up. That\u2019s despite the fact that chatbots today are imperfect at best \u2014 and potentially harmful at worst. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization late last year pushed for governments to regulate the use of generative AI in education, including implementing age limits for users and guardrails on data protection and user privacy.\n\ntitle3:\nTechCrunch Mobility: Aurora launches its driverless commercial trucking service, and a surprise bidder joins Canoo\u2019s bankruptcy case\ndescription3:\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\nYour usual host Kirsten has passed the reins to me, Rebecca Bellan, for the day, and I want to talk about Aurora Innovation and its last-minute save.\nAurora had been promising to launch the U.S.\u2019 first fully autonomous commercial trucking service in April this year, after pushing back its original 2024 debut. With just (proverbial) minutes to spare, Aurora pulled off the win.\nAurora says it has run over 1,200 miles of freight this week between Dallas and Houston with launch customers Hirschbach Motor Lines and Uber Freight. That\u2019s with a single truck, for now. Aurora plans to build up to \u201ctens of self-driving trucks\u201d and expand to El Paso and Phoenix by the end of 2025 as it continues to run more freight for customers with its fleet of supervised autonomous trucks.\nIt\u2019s a huge step for Aurora, and for the industry. But as Trump\u2019s tariffs grind many shipments to a halt, is Aurora well positioned to seize the moment, or could prolonged delays threaten its survival?\nA little bird\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nGot a tip for us?

The two announced this week plans to deploy May\u2019s autonomous vehicles on the Uber platform by the end of 2025, starting in Arlington, Texas, as part of a multi-year partnership.\nMomenta, the Chinese AV startup, is also working with Uber. The two plan to launch Momenta robotaxis on the Uber platform starting in Europe in 2026.\nWaymo and Toyota are exploring a deal that could one day lead to a new self-driving vehicle designed for ride-hailing and possibly even personal autonomous vehicles. It\u2019s still early days, so think of it as more of a soft-launch of their budding relationship.\nElectric vehicles, charging, & batteries\nCanoo\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings are still going on, and now a mysterious London investor has asked the judge to stop the sale of the EV startup\u2019s assets to its CEO, calling it a \u201cflawed process.\u201d He\u2019s throwing down an offer of $20 million for the assets, which trumps Canoo CEO Anthony Aquila\u2019s $4 million bid.\nRivian is sitting pretty on a stockpile of batteries for its trucks, SUVs, and commercial vans that it built up before and after Donald Trump\u2019s election. That\u2019ll soften the blow of the president\u2019s tariffs, which are hitting the auto industry hard.\nSlate Auto, the buzzy new Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup that broke out of stealth last week, is eyeing a printing plant located in Warsaw, Indiana, as the future place where it\u2019ll produce its cheap electric truck.\nTesla\u2019s board reportedly began shopping for a successor to CEO Elon Musk as the chief\u2019s cavorting in Washington has devalued the brand, and its margins, hard. Tesla chair Robyn Denholm denied the reporting from The Wall Street Journal.\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of Tesla\u2019s board, let\u2019s turn our attention to board member Joe Gebbia (who is also connected to DOGE). Gebbia acquired about 4,000 shares of Tesla stock at a $1 million value, which is notable because it\u2019s so rare to see board members straight up buy stock.\nMiscellaneous\nFord has shut down its FNV4 software architecture initiative, a project it had once thought of as critical to compete with EV leaders like Tesla. Closing the initiative means an end to years of development that would vertically integrate vehicle software across Ford\u2019s gas and electric lineups.\nJoby Aviation transitioned its eVTOL from horizontal to vertical flight for the first time with a pilot on board. It\u2019s a necessary step as the company works toward FAA certification.\nRide-hailing and delivery\nDoorDash wants a California judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Uber that accuses the delivery company of stifling competition by intimidating restaurant owners into exclusive deals. DoorDash said the lawsuit was nothing but a scare tactic from Uber to avoid \u201creal competition.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nUber's latest autonomous vehicle partner? Chinese startup Momenta\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nUber announced Friday yet another autonomous vehicle partnership as it leverages its dominant ride-hail and delivery position while relying on partners to supply the self-driving tech it isn\u2019t building in-house. Today, the lucky startup is Chinese self-driving firm Momenta.\nThe tie-up comes a day after Uber added Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility to its roster of AV collaborators, which also includes Volkswagen, Waymo, Wayve, WeRide and many others.\nUber said it would add Momenta\u2019s robotaxis to the app starting in Europe in early 2026, with safety operators onboard.\nMomenta CEO Xudong Cao said the partnership \u201ccompletes the key ecosystem needed to scale autonomous driving globally.\u201d\nThe plethora of deals on Uber\u2019s end \u2014 which span into trucking and delivery \u2014 come as the company may expect to face potential competition from Tesla, which plans to launch its first robotaxi service in Austin this summer. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised that all Tesla vehicles will one day \u2014 with a mere software update \u2014 turn into fully self-driving vehicles to be used for ride-hail.\nUber once had its own self-driving unit but sold the division to Aurora Innovation in 2020.\"\n\nResponse:",
