This figure marks a 24% year-on-year increase and the business segment\u2019s largest growth rate in 13 quarters. Annual revenue run rate for the business segment is $142 billion, according to Amazon. The cloud service also saw an increase in its operating income from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter compared to $10.6 billion in the same period in 2024.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very different having 24% year-over-year growth on $142 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth on a meaningfully smaller base, which is the case with our competitors,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. \u201cWe continue to add more incremental revenue and capacity than others, and extend our leadership position.\u201d\nThat fourth-quarter growth was fueled by new agreements with Salesforce, BlackRock, Perplexity, and the U.S. Air Force, among other companies and government entities.\n\u201cMore of the top 500 U.S. startups use AWS as their primary cloud provider than the next two providers combined,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cWe\u2019re adding significant easy to core computing capacity each day.\u201d\nAWS also added more than a gigawatt of power to its data center network in the fourth quarter.\nJassy said AWS still sees a fair amount of its business coming from enterprises that want to move infrastructure from on-premise to the cloud. AWS is, of course, also seeing a boost from the AI boom, and Jassy credited AWS\u2019s top-to-bottom AI stack functionality.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe consistently see customers wanting to run their AI workloads where the rest of their applications and data are,\u201d Jassy said. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing that as customers run large AI workloads on AWS, they\u2019re adding to their core AWS footprint as well.\u201d\nAWS made up 16.6% of Amazon\u2019s overall $213.4 billion revenue in the fourth quarter.\nAWS\u2019s success wasn\u2019t enough to appease Amazon investors, however. Amazon shares fell 10% in after-hours trading after investors reacted to the company\u2019s plan to boost capital expenditures and missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations on earnings per share.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon and Google are winning the AI capex race - but what's the prize?\ndescription1:\nSometimes, it can seem like the AI industry is racing to see who can spend the most money on data centers. Whoever builds the most data centers will have the most compute, the thinking goes, and thus be able to build the best AI products, which will guarantee victory in the years to come. There are limits to this way of thinking \u2014 traditionally, businesses eventually succeed by making more money and spending less \u2014 but it\u2019s proven remarkably persuasive for large tech companies.\nIf that is the game, Amazon does seem to be winning.\nThe company announced in its earnings on Thursday that it projects $200 billion in capital expenditures throughout 2026, across \u201cAI, chips, robotics, and low earth orbit satellites.\u201d That\u2019s up from the $131.8 billion in capex in 2025. It\u2019s tempting to attribute the whole capex budget to AI. But unlike most of its competitors, Amazon has a significant physical plant, some of which is being converted for use by expensive robots, so the non-AI expenses aren\u2019t so easy to wave away.\nGoogle is close behind. In its earnings on Wednesday, the company projected between $175 billion and $185 billion in capital expenditures for 2026, up from $91.4 billion the previous year. It\u2019s significantly more than the company spent on fixed assets last year, and significantly more than most of its competitors are spending.\nMeta, which reported last week, projected $115 billion to $135 billion in capex spending for 2026, while Oracle (once the poster child for AI infrastructure) projects a measly $50 billion. Microsoft doesn\u2019t have an official projection for 2026 yet, but the most recent quarterly figure was $37.5 billion, which pencils out to roughly $150 billion, assuming it keeps up. It\u2019s a notable increase, and one that has led to investor pressure on CEO Satya Nadella \u2014 but it still puts the company in third place.\nFrom within the tech world, the logic here is simple. The revolutionary potential of AI is going to turn high-end compute into the scarce resource of the future, and only companies that control their own supply will survive. But while Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and others are frantically prepping for the compute desert of the future, their investors aren\u2019t convinced. Each company saw its stock price plummet as investors balked at the hundreds of billions of dollars being committed, and companies with higher spends tended to drop more.\nCrucially, this isn\u2019t just a problem for companies like Meta that haven\u2019t figured out their AI product strategy yet. It\u2019s everyone \u2014 even companies like Microsoft and Amazon with a robust cloud business and a straightforward take on how to make money in the AI era. The numbers are simply too high for investor comfort.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nInvestor sentiment isn\u2019t everything \u2014 and in this case, it may not do much to change the industry\u2019s mind. If you believe AI is about to change everything (and the argument is pretty compelling at this point), you\u2019d be a fool to change course just because Wall Street got jumpy. But going forward, Big Tech companies will be under a lot of pressure to downplay how expensive their AI ambitions really are.\n\ntitle2:\nReddit looks to AI search as its next big opportunity\ndescription2:\nReddit suggested on Thursday that its AI-powered search engine could be the next big opportunity for its business \u2014 not just in terms of product, but also as a revenue driver impacting its bottom line. During the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, it offered an update on its plans to merge traditional and AI search together and hinted that although search is not yet monetized, \u201cit\u2019s an enormous market and opportunity.\u201d\nIn particular, the company believes that generative AI search will be \u201cbetter for most queries.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a type of query we\u2019re, I think, particularly good at \u2014 I would argue, the best on the internet \u2014 which is questions that have no answers, where the answer actually is multiple perspectives from lots of people,\u201d said Reddit CEO Steve Huffman.\nTraditional search, meanwhile, is more like navigation \u2014 it\u2019s a way to find the right link to a topic or subreddit. But LLMs can be good at this, too, if not better, he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going.\u201d\nThe exec also noted that weekly active users for search over the past year grew 30% from 60 million users to 80 million users. Meanwhile, the weekly active users for the AI-powered Reddit Answers grew from 1 million in the first quarter of 2025 to 15 million by the fourth quarter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of growth there, and I think there\u2019s a lot of potential too,\u201d Huffman added.\nReddit said it\u2019s working to modernize the AI answers interface by making its responses more media-rich, and pilots of this are already underway.\nThe company is also thinking about how it can position itself when it\u2019s not just a social site, but a place people come for answers. Reddit told investors on the call that it\u2019s doing away with the distinction between logged-in and logged-out users starting in Q3 2026, as it will aim to personalize the site \u2014 using AI and machine learning \u2014 and make it relevant to whoever shows up.\nThe company announced in 2025 it was planning to combine its AI search feature, Reddit Answers, with its traditional search engine to improve the experience for end users. In the fourth quarter, Reddit said it had made \u201csignificant progress\u201d in unifying its core search and its AI feature. It also released five new languages on Reddit Answers and is piloting dynamic agents along with search results that include \u201cmedia beyond text.\u201d\nThough Reddit sees value in its AI answers, it\u2019s not been keeping that to itself. The company\u2019s content licensing business, which allows other companies to train their AI models on its data, is growing, too. That business revenue is reported as part of Reddit\u2019s \u201cother\u201d revenues (i.e., its non-ad revenue). This \u201cother\u201d revenue increased by 8% year-over-year to reach $36 million in Q4 and was up 22% to reach $140 million for 2025.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI launches new agentic coding model only minutes after Anthropic drops its own\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nOn Monday, OpenAI launched Codex, an agentic coding tool marketed to software developers. Today, OpenAI also launched a new model designed to turbo-charge Codex: GPT-5.3 Codex.\nThe company says that the model transforms Codex from an agent that can merely \u201cwrite and review code\u201d to one that can do \u201cnearly anything developers and professionals do on a computer, expanding who can build software and how work gets done.\u201d Having tested its new model against a number of performance benchmarks, OpenAI claims that it can create \u201chighly functional complex games and apps from scratch over the course of days.\u201d\nOpenAI says that GPT-5.3 Codex is also 25% faster than its previous model (GPT-5.2) and that it was the company\u2019s first model that \u201cwas instrumental in creating itself,\u201d meaning that the company\u2019s staff used early versions of the program to debug itself and evaluate how it was performing.\nThe new model release notably follows hot on the heels of a new agentic coding model released by its competitor, Anthropic. Indeed, OpenAI and Anthropic had originally planned to release their two agentic coding tools at the exact same time: 10 a.m. PST. However, not long before the original release time, Anthropic moved its release date up by 15 minutes, slightly besting OpenAI in the race to publicize the models.\n\ntitle4:\nElon Musk is getting serious about orbital data centers\ndescription4:\nOn Friday, when SpaceX filed plans with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a million-satellite data center network, you might have thought Elon Musk was having a bit of fun with us. But a week later, it is clear that he is dead serious.\nThe most obvious step, of course, is the formal merger between SpaceX and xAI that went forward on Monday, officially drawing together Musk\u2019s space and AI ventures in a way that makes a lot more sense if there\u2019s some kind of joint infrastructure project planned.\nBut even beyond the merger, we\u2019re starting to see the idea of orbital AI data clusters \u2014 essentially, networks of computers operating in space \u2014 cohere into an actual plan. On Wednesday, the FCC accepted the filing and set a schedule seeking public comment. It\u2019s a pro forma step normally, but FCC chairman Brendan Carr took the unusual step of sharing the filing on X. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Carr has shown himself eager to help Trump\u2019s friends and punish his enemies \u2014 so as long as Musk stays on Trump\u2019s good side, the proposal is likely to sail through without issue.\nAt the same time, Elon Musk has started to flesh out the argument for orbital data centers in public. On a new episode of Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison\u2019s podcast \u201cCheeky Pint,\u201d which also featured guest Dwarkesh Patel, Musk laid out the basic case for moving most of our AI computing power into space. Essentially, solar panels produce more power in space, so you can cut down on one of the main operating expenses for data centers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space,\u201d Musk said in the podcast. \u201cAny given solar panel is going to give you about five times more power in space than on the ground, so it\u2019s actually much cheaper to do in space.\u201d\nClose listeners will note that there is a bit of a gap in the logic here! It\u2019s true that solar panels produce more power in space, but since power isn\u2019t the only cost in operating a data center and solar panels aren\u2019t the only way to power a data center, it doesn\u2019t follow that it\u2019s cheaper to do the whole thing in orbit, as Patel noted in the podcast. Patel also raised concerns about servicing GPUs that fail during AI model training, but you\u2019ll have to listen to the full episode for that.\nNew season of Cheeky Pint starts tomorrow! First up: @dwarkesh_sp and I sit down with @elonmusk to discuss space GPUs and much more. pic.twitter.com/dJ4dLluTMr \u2014 John Collison (@collision) February 4, 2026\nOverall, Musk was undeterred, marking 2028 as a tipping point year for orbital data centers. \u201cYou can mark my words, in 36 months but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,\u201d Musk said.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nHe didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cFive years from now, my prediction is we will launch and be operating every year more AI in space than the cumulative total on Earth,\u201d Musk continued.\nFor context, as of 2030, global data center capacity will be an estimated 200 GW, which is roughly a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of infrastructure when you\u2019re just putting it on the ground.\nOf course, SpaceX makes its money by launching things into orbit, so all this is pretty convenient for Musk \u2014 particularly now that SpaceX has an AI company attached to it. And with the new SpaceX-xAI conglomerate headed for an IPO in just a few months, you can expect to hear a lot more about orbital data centers in the months ahead. With tech companies still pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into data center spending each year, there\u2019s a real chance that not all the money will remain earthbound.\"\n\nResponse:",
