Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The restriction could put a ceiling on export licenses for certain countries, potentially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are heavily investing in AI data centers.\nThe White House increasingly views American AI chips as a key advantage on the global stage. Last year, the United States banned the sale of Nvidia and AMD\u2019s advanced AI chips to China, and placed export restrictions on 40 other countries around the globe to close loopholes where AI chips could indirectly get to China.\nThe latest reported discussions could indicate that U.S. officials are worried about the Persian Gulf\u2019s global influence over the AI industry. This year, Saudi Arabia reportedly planned to launch a $40 billion fund to invest in AI technology, while OpenAI reportedly held discussions with a UAE-backed investment fund over participating in its latest $6.6 billion funding round.\n\ntitle1:\nChip firm ASML shares plunge 15% after company sees weaker China sales\ndescription1:\nIn this article ASML-NL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nAn icon of ASML is displayed on a smartphone, with an ASML chip visible in the background. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nShares in semiconductor equipment maker ASML fell 16% on Tuesday after the Dutch company published financial results a day early, issuing disappointing sales forecasts. The move pulled other chip stocks lower, with Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom all falling after the report. ASML, which is based in Veldhoven, Netherlands, said it expects net sales for 2025 to come in between 30 billion euros and 35 billion euros ($32.7 billion and $38.1 billion), at the lower half of the range it had previously provided. Net bookings for the September quarter were 2.6 billion euros ($2.83 billion), the company said \u2014 well below the 5.6 billion euro LSEG consensus estimate. Net sales, however, beat expectations coming in at 7.5 billion euros. \"While there continue to be strong developments and upside potential in AI, other market segments are taking longer to recover. It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected,\" company CEO Christophe Fouquet said in the earnings release.\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon AMSL\nASML said that the early publication of its results was due to a technical error which saw it erroneously publish the report on a part of its website. In the lead-up to the earnings, Wall Street analysts had turned more cautious on the company, which is a critical supplier to the broader semiconductor industry.\nChina concerns\nThe company is facing a tougher business outlook in China due to U.S. and Dutch export restrictions on shipments. Last month, the U.S. government rolled out new export controls on critical technologies to China, including advanced chipmaking tools. Separately, the Dutch government announced plans to take over control of exports of ASML's machines to the country. ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography machines are used by many of the world's largest chipmakers \u2014 from Nvidia to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing \u2014 to produce advanced chips. ASML CFO Roger Dassen said Tuesday that he expects the company's China business to show a \"more normalized percentage in our order book and also in our business.\" \"We do see China trending towards more historically normal percentages in our business,\" Dassen said, according to a transcript of a video, also released a day early. \"So we expect China to come in at around 20% of our total revenue for next year. Which would also be in line with its representation in our backlog.\" In its June-quarter earnings presentation, ASML said that 49% of its sales come from China.\n\ntitle2:\nApple announces new iPad mini, available to order now\ndescription2:\nApple announced a new iPad mini on Tuesday, offering the first update to its smallest tablet since 2021.\nThe new iPad mini comes with a faster A17 Pro processor, the same chip that was in last year's iPhone 15 Pro. That means it supports Apple Intelligence, the company's new suite of artificial intelligence features that will slowly begin rolling out to users this month.\nDuring the company's fiscal third quarter, Apple showed the strongest growth in its iPad segment, which grew about 24% year over year after it introduced several new iPads for the first time since 2022.\nApple's smallest iPad has attracted a fanbase of users who appreciate its more portable 8.3-inch screen for reading books or taking notes. The iPad Mini supports the latest Apple Pencil Pro, which was introduced alongside the iPad Pros earlier this year.\nIt starts at $499, can be preordered now and launches in stores on Oct. 23.\n\ntitle3:\nVideo game actors and publishers are finally negotiating again\ndescription3:\nThe video game voice actor strike could be over soon. SAG-AFTRA, which negotiates the interactive media agreement that governs video game performances, has announced that negotiations on the agreement will resume on Wednesday, October 23rd.\nSAG-AFTRA and members of the interactive media bargaining group \u2014 which includes video game companies like Activision, Insomniac Games, Take Two, Electronic Arts, and more \u2014 had been negotiating a new interactive media agreement for almost two years. In September of last year, SAG-AFTRA members voted for strike authorization, warning that a strike would be forthcoming if the two parties could not reach a deal. This summer, a strike was formally authorized and SAG-AFTRA members began picketing on July 26th.\nThe negotiations\u2019 failure surrounded worker protections regarding the use of AI. SAG-AFTRA claimed that the bargaining committee refused to grant protections to both voice and motion performers. The bargaining companies disagreed saying that the protections offered were in line with industry standards.\nNegotiations are resuming shortly after SAG-AFTRA announced that it was adding League of Legends to the list of struck games. The union filed an unfair labor complaint against Formosa Entertainment, the company that provides voice acting services to League and other titles developed by Riot Games. SAG-AFTRA claimed the company attempted to circumvent the strike by hiring non-union talent.\n\ntitle4:\nAMD and Intel are teaming up to fend off ARM chips\ndescription4:\nNothing brings rivals together like a common enemy, and in this case it\u2019s the rise of ARM pulling Intel and AMD closer together than ever. The two chip makers \u2014 not exactly the friendliest frenemies \u2014 are the headlining members of a new x86 Advisory Group to try and defend the platform\u2019s interests against ARM, which finally appears poised to challenge x86\u2019s dominance.\nThe alliance includes a long list of other founding members including Microsoft, Google, and Meta, as well as Lenovo, the company that hosted the announcement at its Tech World 2024 conference in Bellevue, Washington. This morning\u2019s keynote featured appearances by AMD CEO Lisa Su as well as Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who unsurprisingly said that the x86 architecture is \u201calive and well.\u201d\nAMD CEO Lisa Su appeared on stage shortly after Gelsinger. Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\nAccording to a press release, the stated goal of the advisory group is to \u201cenhance compatibility, predictability and consistency across x86 product offerings.\u201d The group intends to ask for input from x86 hardware and software developers and hopes to create \u201csimplified architectural guidelines\u201d to help standardize interfaces across AMD and Intel\u2019s product lines.\nThat\u2019s a worthwhile goal, but you also don\u2019t have to read too hard between the lines to see the new group as an effort to reassure developers, customers, and (maybe mostly) investors that these companies \u2014 essentially the only two makers of x86 chips \u2014 are Doing Something about ARM. Integrated chips based on ARM architecture are on the rise: Apple fully transitioned from Intel chips to ARM-based Apple silicon midway through last year, and after a decade of failed attempts Qualcomm is finally proving that it can make a good ARM chip for Windows machines.\"\n\nResponse:",
