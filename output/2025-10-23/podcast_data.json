Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

But the company\u2019s recovery story deserves several chapters dedicated to cost cutting via layoffs and other reductions as well as a series of high-profile investments from Softbank, Nvidia, and the U.S. government.\nIntel added $20 billion to its balance sheet during the third quarter, the company announced on its third-quarter earnings presentation on Thursday, sending its stock soaring. This growth was largely due to three sizable investments in the company over the last three months.\nIn August, SoftBank invested $2 billion. A few days later, the U.S. Government took an unprecedented 10% equity stake in Intel. The company has received $5.7 billion of the planned $8.9 billion from the U.S. Government thus far. Nvidia also bought a $5 billion stake in Intel in September as part of a broader deal to develop chips together over time.\n\u201cThe actions we took to strengthen the balance sheet give us greater operational flexibility and position us well to continue to execute our strategy with confidence,\u201d Tan said on the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cIn particular, I\u2019m honored by the trust and confidence President Trump and Secretary [Howard] Lutnick have placed in me. Their support highlights Intel\u2019s strategic role as the only U.S.-based semiconductor company with leading edge logic, [research and development] and manufacturing.\u201d\nThe company also received $5.2 billion from closing the sale of its ownership stake of Altera, a hardware company it had owned since 2015, on September 12. It also sold its stake in Mobileye, an autonomous driving tech company.\nIntel grew its quarterly revenue by $800 million in the third quarter to $13.7 billion, compared to $12.9 billion. Intel had net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter, a steep reversal from the $16.6 billion loss it reported in the same year-ago period.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe foundry biz\nDespite the strong quarter, there weren\u2019t many details on what will happen next with Intel\u2019s foundry business, which makes custom chips for customers. The business has floundered from the start and has been a focus of Tan, who initiated significant layoffs in its foundry business this summer.\nThe business appears to be a priority of the Trump administration; a key condition of the government\u2019s investment in Intel includes language that it will penalize Intel if it divested from its foundry business over the next five years.\nWall Street is keeping a close eye on foundry for signs of the company\u2019s long-term growth. Intel analysts told TechCrunch in August that the company did not need cash to turn itself around but rather a strategy to get its foundry business on track.\nTan said that Intel thinks its foundry business is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to capitalize on the swelling demand for chips but was light on the details \u2014 beyond saying that the company is actively engaging with potential foundry customers \u2014 and added that the growth of the foundry business would remain disciplined.\n\u201cBuilding a world-class foundry is a long-term effort founded on trust,\u201d Tan said. \u201cAs a foundry, we need to ensure that our process can be easily used by a variety of customers, each with their unique way of building their own products. We must learn to delight our customers as they count on us to build wafers, to meet all their needs for powerful performance, yield, cost, and schedule.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI buys Sky, an AI interface for Mac\ndescription1:\nOpenAI announced on Thursday it has acquired Software Applications, Inc., the makers of an AI-powered natural language interface for Mac computers called Sky.\nThe software product, which had not been released to the public, is designed to work alongside you throughout your day, as you use apps on the computer, writing, planning, coding, and more. Similar to AI browsers, Sky can see what\u2019s on the your screen and take action in your apps for you.\nThe move is a significant step toward embedding OpenAI\u2019s technology into consumers\u2019 everyday lives and within businesses that run on Mac.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted computers to be more empowering, customizable, and intuitive. With LLMs, we can finally put the pieces together. That\u2019s why we built Sky, an AI experience that floats over your desktop to help you think and create. We\u2019re thrilled to join OpenAI to bring that vision to hundreds of millions of people,\u201d Software Applications co-founder and CEO Ari Weinstein said in a statement.\nNotably, the team behind Sky had another prominent exit before this.\nWeinstein and Conrad Kramer previously co-founded Workflow, which they sold to Apple, where it became the technology now known as Shortcuts. Both continued to work at Apple for several years before leaving to found Software Applications in August 2023. Sky\u2019s third co-founder and COO, Kim Beverett, was a senior program and product manager at Apple, where she spent nearly 10 years working on technology like Safari, WebKit, Privacy, Messages, Mail, Phone, FaceTime, and SharePlay.\nApple, which has so far been behind on AI, is expected to launch an overhauled Siri with AI smarts next year. Apple has already shipped other features that use its AI tech known as Apple Intelligence, including writing helpers, live translation, image creation, visual search, and more. It\u2019s also working with OpenAI to shuffle off queries Siri can\u2019t answer to ChatGPT. Apple Intelligence works across platforms, including Mac.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIn addition, Apple offers a Foundation Models framework that provides access to local AI models, allowing developers to build AI into their apps directly.\nHowever, Apple values privacy as a core part of its AI offering, and an agentic system that views your screen and takes action on your behalf could raise concerns for some of its more security-minded customers. Agentic AI is still in its early days, and recent reviews indicate that AI browsers have a lot of safety risks. It could take Apple time to launch a Mac AI system comparable to Sky, as a result.\nDeal terms for OpenAI\u2019s acquistion were not revealed, but Sky\u2019s maker had raised $6.5 million from investors, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Figma CEO Dylan Field, Context Ventures, and Stellation Capital, according to data from Pitchbook. OpenAI disclosed that Altman held a passive interest in the startup through an investment fund.\nThe deal was led by Head of ChatGPT Nick Turley and OpenAI\u2019s CEO of Applications, Fidji Simo, and approved by OpenAI\u2019s board.\n\ntitle2:\nInstagram users can now use Meta AI editing tools directly in IG Stories\ndescription2:\nMeta is bringing its AI-powered photo and video editing tools directly to Instagram Stories, allowing users to enter text prompts to add or remove things in photos and videos or even change it completely.\nWhile Meta has already offered image editing capabilities on Instagram, those tools were limited to interactions with the Meta AI chatbot. The addition of text-based prompts in Stories now makes these editing features much more accessible.\nThe new features can be found in the \u201cRestyle\u201d menu located at the top of Instagram Stories when tapping the paintbrush icon. To edit an image, choose \u201cadd,\u201d \u201cremove,\u201d or \u201cchange\u201d to describe what you want to change in the prompt bar. For instance, Meta explains you can ask it to change your hair color, add a crown to your head, or insert a sunset background.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThere are also preset effects you can choose from that can alter your outfit or change the image\u2019s style. For example, you can add items like sunglasses or a biker jacket, and you can also apply a watercolor effect to the image. For videos, you can make it look like it\u2019s snowing or add flames.\nIt\u2019s important to note that when you\u2019re using Meta AI on Instagram, you\u2019re accepting Meta\u2019s AI Terms of Service, which allow your media and facial features to be analyzed by AI. According to these terms, when you upload your photos, Meta can \u201csummarize image contents, modify images, and generate new content based on the image.\u201d\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta continues to introduce AI updates to remain competitive in the market. It was most recently spotted testing a \u201cWrite with Meta AI\u201d prompt that helps Instagram users come up with clever comments for posts.\nLast month, the company launched a new AI-generated video feed called \u201cVibes\u201d in the Meta AI app, likely boosting downloads. New data from Similarweb shows that the app\u2019s daily active users on iOS and Android increased to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from about 775,000 four weeks ago.\nAdditionally, to address any concerns parents may have, Meta announced earlier this month that it is introducing new parental control features that enable parents to disable chats with AI characters and monitor the topics their teenagers are discussing with the Meta AI chatbot.\n\ntitle3:\nFord isn't going to make more F-150 Lightnings for a while\ndescription3:\nFord Motor has put its gas and hybrid F-150 and F-Series Super Duty trucks at the top of the production priority line as it attempts to recover from losses connected to a fire at a critical aluminum supplier\u2019s factory.\nThe automaker\u2019s all-electric F-150 Lightning didn\u2019t make the list.\nFord said Thursday that assembly of the F-150 Lightning truck at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan will remain paused. The reason, according to Ford: the gas and hybrid F-Series trucks are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminum.\nWhile Ford has highlighted sales growth of its all-electric F-150 Lightning truck, those numbers are still dwarfed by its gas-powered F-Series trucks.\nFord sold 10,005 F-150 Lightning pickups in the third quarter, a 39.7% increase year-over-year. To put that into context, Ford delivered 545,522 vehicles in the third quarter, 207,732 of which were F-Series. To date, Ford has sold 23,034 F-150 Lightning trucks in 2025, about 1% more than the first nine months of 2024, according to recent sales data.\nA Ford spokesperson noted that while F-150 is the best-selling electric pickup in the U.S., the company is focused on producing the gas and hybrid trucks as it recovers from the September 16 fire at aluminum supplier Novelis\u2019 plant in Oswego, New York that severely damaged its hot mill. Novelis said it expects to restart its hot mill by December 2025.\n\u201cWe have good inventories of the F-150 Lightning and will bring Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) back up at the right time, but don\u2019t have an exact date at this time,\u201d said spokesperson Ian Thibodeau.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe Novelis plant fire has been costly for Ford and disrupted production of some of its most popular and profitable vehicles. The fire will cost Ford up to $2 billion in earnings in the fourth quarter, the automaker reported Thursday in its third-quarter earnings. That cost, coupled with up to a $1 billion headwind from tariffs, led Ford to lower its full-year profit guidance for 2025 to $6 billion from $6.5 billion.\nFord\u2019s solution to recover fire-related losses is to increase F-Series production volume by more than 50,000 trucks in 2026 by adding a third shift. The plan is expected to create up to 1,000 new jobs and all hourly employees at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center will be transferred next door to work the third shift at the Dearborn Truck Plant.\n\ntitle4:\nYouTube paid out $8B to the music industry in 12 months\ndescription4:\nYouTube has paid more than $8 billion to the music industry in the 12 months between July 2024 and July 2025, the company announced on Thursday.\n\u201cToday\u2019s $8 billion payout is a testament to the fact that the twin engine of ads and subscriptions is firing on all cylinders,\u201d said YouTube\u2019s Global Head of Music, Lyor Cohen, in a statement. \u201cThis number is not an endpoint; it represents meaningful, sustained progress in our journey to build a long-term home for every artist, songwriter, and publisher on the global stage.\u201d\nCohen first announced the milestone during a talk at Billboard Latin Music Week on Wednesday.\nThe milestone marks a new record for the platform, as YouTube\u2019s annual music industry payout increased by $2 billion since 2022, when the company reported contributing $6 billion in revenue to the music industry between July 2021 and June 2022. A year before that, in 2021, YouTube announced that it had paid out $4 billion to the industry in 12 months.\nThursday\u2019s announcement comes as Spotify announced earlier this year that it paid out $10 billion to the music industry in 2024. The company delivered $9 billion in 2023. It\u2019s worth noting that the artists themselves don\u2019t receive all the money \u2014 it also goes to labels, publishers, songwriters, and others.\nYouTube says it\u2019s seeing momentum from its twin-engine revenue model, noting that it has over 125 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including users on trials. The company also said that it has two billion logged-in viewers who watch music videos each month.\n\u201cAs the platform\u2019s global footprint continues to expand, so does the potential for artists and songwriters to build long-lasting music careers and forever fans on YouTube,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
