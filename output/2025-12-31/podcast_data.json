Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

It is a phenomenon that cycles in and out of fashion, and right now it is certainly having a moment amid the AI boom.\nThis trend is particularly evident during Y Combinator Demo Days, where founders are increasingly touting their dropout status in their one-minute pitches.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe YC formally tracks dropout status but, anecdotally, in recent batches, I was struck by how many founders highlight being a dropout from college, grad school, and even high school,\u201d said Katie Jacobs Stanton, founder and general partner of Moxxie Ventures. \u201cBeing a dropout is a kind of credential in itself, reflecting a deep conviction and commitment to building. I think it\u2019s perceived as something quite positive in the venture ecosystem.\u201d\nAlthough many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young, most still opted to stay for the diploma. For instance, Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor, graduated from MIT, and Cognition co-founder Scott Wu graduated from Harvard.\nYet despite these examples, a growing number of aspiring entrepreneurs fear that staying to graduate means missing the most critical window of the AI building cycle. Some, like Brendan Foody, who co-founded Mercor, have famously dropped out of prestigious schools like Georgetown to pursue their startups.\nAs Kulveer Taggar, founder of the YC-focused venture firm Phosphor Capital, told TechCrunch: \u201cThere\u2019s just this sense of urgency and maybe FOMO.\u201d There is a calculation right now: \u201cI can finish my degree, or I can just start building.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

One professor at an elite university recently described a student walking away from his degree in his final semester. That student was convinced that having a diploma would actually hurt his chances of getting funded.\nWhile some founders fear that a diploma could be a negative signal, Yuri Sagalov, who leads General Catalyst\u2019s seed strategy, suggests that VCs are less fixated on the dropout label, especially for students close to graduating: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt any different about someone who graduated or didn\u2019t graduate when they\u2019re in [their] fourth year and drop out.\u201d\nEven though self-taught tech prodigies can build startups without a formal education, Sagalov argues that there\u2019s still value in the social network that a university creates and the brand of the university, even if the founder doesn\u2019t receive a diploma.\n\u2018You get a lot of the social value\u2026 because you can put the fact that you participated,\u2019 Sagalov said. \u201cMost people will look you up on LinkedIn and not care as much whether you finished or not.\u201d\nWhile many investors now believe founders can forego a university degree, not all VCs agree that young founders have an edge in this market.\nWesley Chan, co-founder of FPV Ventures, isn\u2019t as eager to invest in dropouts because he prioritizes a trait most young founders haven\u2019t developed yet: wisdom. Chan believes that wisdom is typically found in \u201colder founders or people who have a couple of scars under their belt.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nEvery fusion startup that has raised over $100M\ndescription2:\nOver the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes \u2014 always a decade away! \u2014 to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.\nThe technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what\u2019s known as scientific breakeven, and while it\u2019s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.\nCFS\u2019s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls \u201ccommercially relevant\u201d levels.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\nThe Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.\nCFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.\nTAE Technologies\nFounded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\nIn December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump\u2019s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media.\nThe fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook.\nHelion\nOf all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\nHelion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma\u2019s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor\u2019s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\nThe company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\nPacific Fusion\nPacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.\nThe company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion\u2019s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn\u2019t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that\u2019s common in biotech.\nShine Technologies\nShine Technologies is taking a cautious \u2014 and possibly pragmatic \u2014 approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it\u2019s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn\u2019t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it\u2019s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.\nThe company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\nGeneral Fusion\nNow its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\nIn General Fusion\u2019s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\nGeneral Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.\nIn August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called \u201cthe least amount of capital possible\u201d to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook.\nTokamak Energy\nTokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design \u2014 the doughnut shape \u2014 and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.\nThe Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup\u2019s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Faberg\u00e9 egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company\u2019s magnets in \u201cfusion power plant-relevant scenarios.\u201d Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.\nIn total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.\nZap Energy\nZap Energy isn\u2019t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.\nProxima Fusion\nMost investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.\nProxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a \u20ac130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than \u20ac185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\nStellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist \u2014 literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma\u2019s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.\nKyoto Fusioneering\nWith all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity.\nKyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out.\nVenture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment.\nMarvel Fusion\nMarvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry\u2019s decades of experience.\nThe inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.\nFirst Light Fusion\nUnlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn\u2019t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.\nBut even then, First Light doesn\u2019t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition.\nIn March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build \u201cpulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.\u201d In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue.\nBased in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook.\nXcimer\nThough nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that\u2019s behind the National Ignition Facility\u2019s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF\u2019s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.\nFounded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.\nThis story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.\n\ntitle3:\nThe 10 top government, legal startups from Disrupt Startup Battlefield\ndescription3:\nEvery year, TechCrunch\u2019s Startup Battlefield pitch contest draws thousands of applicants.
