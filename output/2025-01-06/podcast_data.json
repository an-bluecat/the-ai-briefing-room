Parameters roughly correspond to a model\u2019s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.\nThe GB10, which was developed in partnership with MediaTek, features an Nvidia Blackwell GPU connected to a 20-core Nvidia Grace CPU. Inside the Project Digits enclosure, the chips are hooked up to a 128GB pool of memory and up to 4TB of flash storage.\nImage Credits:Nvidia\nNvidia says that two Project Digits machines can be linked together to run up to 405-billion-parameter models, if a job calls for it. Project Digits can deliver a standalone experience, as alluded to earlier, or connect to a primary Windows or Mac PC.\nBut it\u2019s not cheap. Project Digits machines, which run Nvidia\u2019s Linux-based DGX OS, will be available starting in May from \u201ctop partners\u201d for $3,000, the company said.\nSo it won\u2019t be just anyone who can afford a Project Digits unit of their own. Huang thinks that there\u2019s a market, however.\n\u201cWith Project Digits, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia announces $3,000 personal AI supercomputer called Digits\ndescription1:\nIf you were looking for your own personal AI supercomputer, Nvidia has you covered.\nThe chipmaker announced at CES it\u2019s launching a personal AI supercomputer called Project Digits in May. The heart of Project Digits is the new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which packs enough processing power to run sophisticated AI models while being compact enough to fit on a desk and run from a standard power outlet (this kind of processing power used to require much larger, more power-hungry systems). This desktop-sized system can handle AI models with up to 200 billion parameters, and has a starting price of $3,000. The product itself looks a lot like a Mac Mini.\n\u201cAI will be mainstream in every application for every industry. With Project Digits, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a press release. \u201cPlacing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.\u201d\nThe Digits supercomputer specs. Image: Nvidia\nEach Project Digits system comes equipped with 128GB of unified, coherent memory (by comparison, a good laptop might have 16GB or 32GB of RAM) and up to 4TB of NVMe storage. For even more demanding applications, two Project Digits systems can be linked together to handle models with up to 405 billion parameters (Meta\u2019s best model, Llama 3.1, has 405 billion parameters).\nThe GB10 chip delivers up to 1 petaflop of AI performance (which means it can perform 1 quadrillion AI calculations per second) at FP4 precision (which helps make the calculations faster by making approximations), and the system features Nvidia\u2019s latest-generation CUDA cores and fifth-generation Tensor Cores, connected via NVLink-C2C to a Grace CPU containing 20 power-efficient Arm-based cores. MediaTek, known for their Arm-based chip designs, collaborated on the GB10\u2019s development to optimize its power efficiency and performance.\nUsers will also get access to Nvidia\u2019s AI software library, including development kits, orchestration tools, and pre-trained models available through the Nvidia NGC catalog. The system runs on Linux-based Nvidia DGX OS and supports popular frameworks like PyTorch, Python, and Jupyter notebooks. Developers can fine-tune models using the Nvidia NeMo framework and accelerate data science workflows with Nvidia RAPIDS libraries.\nUsers can develop and test their AI models locally on Project Digits, then deploy them to cloud services or data center infrastructure using the same Grace Blackwell architecture and Nvidia AI Enterprise software platform.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia, chip stocks pop after Foxconn reports record revenue\ndescription2:\nGlobal semiconductor stocks climbed Monday after contract electronics giant Foxconn announced record fourth-quarter revenue, suggesting the artificial intelligence boom has far more room to run.\nHon Hai Precision Industry, which does business as Foxconn internationally, said in a Sunday statement that the company's fourth-quarter revenue totaled 2.1 trillion New Taiwan dollars ($63.9 billion), growing 15% year over year.\nFoxconn \u2014 which is a supplier to Apple \u2014 also set a record, posting the highest fourth-quarter revenue ever in company history, according to the statement.\nThe firm's bumper revenue performance was driven by growth in its cloud and networking products \u2014 which includes AI servers like those designed by the likes of chipmaker Nvidia \u2014 and components and other product segments.\nComputing products and smart consumer electronics \u2014 which numbers iPhone and other smartphones \u2014 saw \"slight declines,\" Foxconn said.\nShares of several semiconductor firms across Asia, Europe and the U.S. rose, as a result.\nStateside, Nvidia got a boost from the Foxconn numbers, closing up more than 3% on Monday.\nJensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, is slated to deliver a keynote address at the 2025 Consumer Electronics Show 2025 later Monday.\nAlso boosting chip stocks more generally is Microsoft's announcement at the end of last week about plans to invest $80 billion in 2025 on data centers that can handle AI workloads.\nMicrosoft is one of several tech giants splurging on GPUs, or graphics processing units, from Nvidia to train and run the most advanced AI models.\nAMD, Nvidia's closest rival, also closed up more than 3% Monday, while fellow U.S. chip firms Qualcomm and Broadcom also climbed more than 1%.\n\ntitle3:\nCryptocurrencies rise to start the week, bitcoin jumps above $102,000\ndescription3:\nThe price of bitcoin leapt back above $100,000 to start the first full trading week of the new year.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 4% at $102,250.00, according to Coin Metrics. The broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index, gained about 2.5%. Bitcoin and ether are coming off their best weeks since Dec. 6, while Solana had its best week since Nov. 22.\n\"Overall, we are in a bullish environment and traders appear to be risk-on as we head into the new year,\" Marko Jurina, CEO at crypto swaps platform Jumper.Exchange. \"With Trump's election set to be certified today, and January often being a bullish month \u2014 six of the past 10 years saw positive price action \u2014 it's no wonder markets are moving upward.\"\n\ntitle4:\nMusk and Trump, EU AI Act\ndescription4:\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas, on Nov. 19, 2024. Brandon Bell | Via Reuters\nThe U.S. political landscape is set to undergo some shifts in 2025 \u2014 and those changes will have some major implications for the regulation of artificial intelligence. President-elect Donald Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. Joining him in the White House will be a raft of top advisors from the world of business \u2014 including Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 who are expected to influence policy thinking around nascent technologies such as AI and cryptocurrencies. Across the Atlantic, a tale of two jurisdictions has emerged, with the U.K. and European Union diverging in regulatory thinking. While the EU has taken more of a heavy hand with the Silicon Valley giants behind the most powerful AI systems, Britain has adopted a more light-touch approach. In 2025, the state of AI regulation globally could be in for a major overhaul. CNBC takes a look at some of the key developments to watch \u2014 from the evolution of the EU's landmark AI Act to what a Trump administration could do for the U.S.\nMusk's U.S. policy influence\nElon Musk walks on Capitol Hill on the day of a meeting with Senate Republican Leader-elect John Thune (R-SD), in Washington, U.S. December 5, 2024. Benoit Tessier | Reuters\nAlthough it's not an issue that featured very heavily during Trump's election campaign, artificial intelligence is expected to be one of the key sectors set to benefit from the next U.S. administration. For one, Trump appointed Musk, CEO of electric car manufacturer Tesla , to co-lead his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" alongside Ramaswamy, an American biotech entrepreneur who dropped out of the 2024 presidential election race to back Trump. Matt Calkins, CEO of Appian, told CNBC Trump's close relationship with Musk could put the U.S. in a good position when it comes to AI, citing the billionaire's experience as a co-founder of OpenAI and CEO of xAI, his own AI lab, as positive indicators. \"We've finally got one person in the U.S. administration who truly knows about AI and has an opinion about it,\" Calkins said in an interview last month. Musk was one of Trump's most prominent endorsers in the business community, even appearing at some of his campaign rallies.\nThere is currently no confirmation on what Trump has planned in terms of possible presidential directives or executive orders. But Calkins thinks it's likely Musk will look to suggest guardrails to ensure AI development doesn't endanger civilization \u2014 a risk he's warned about multiple times in the past. \"He has an unquestioned reluctance to allow AI to cause catastrophic human outcomes \u2013 he's definitely worried about that, he was talking about it long before he had a policy position,\" Calkins told CNBC. Currently, there is no comprehensive federal AI legislation in the U.S. Rather, there's been a patchwork of regulatory frameworks at the state and local level, with numerous AI bills introduced across 45 states plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThe EU AI Act\nThe European Union is so far the only jurisdiction globally to drive forward comprehensive rules for artificial intelligence with its AI Act. Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nThe European Union has so far been the only jurisdiction globally to push forward with comprehensive statutory rules for the AI industry. Earlier this year, the bloc's AI Act \u2014 a first-of-its-kind AI regulatory framework \u2014 officially entered into force. The law isn't yet fully in force yet, but it's already causing tension among large U.S. tech companies, who are concerned that some aspects of the regulation are too strict and may quash innovation. In December, the EU AI Office, a newly created body overseeing models under the AI Act, published a second-draft code of practice for general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, which refers to systems like OpenAI's GPT family of large language models, or LLMs. The second draft included exemptions for providers of certain open-source AI models. Such models are typically available to the public to allow developers to build their own custom versions. It also includes a requirement for developers of \"systemic\" GPAI models to undergo rigorous risk assessments. The Computer & Communications Industry Association \u2014 whose members include Amazon , Google and Meta \u2014 warned it \"contains measures going far beyond the Act's agreed scope, such as far-reaching copyright measures.\" The AI Office wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. It's worth noting the EU AI Act is far from reaching full implementation. As Shelley McKinley, chief legal officer of popular code repository platform GitHub, told CNBC in November, \"the next phase of the work has started, which may mean there's more ahead of us than there is behind us at this point.\" For example, in February, the first provisions of the Act will become enforceable. These provisions cover \"high-risk\" AI applications such as remote biometric identification, loan decisioning and educational scoring. A third draft of the code on GPAI models is slated for publication that same month. European tech leaders are concerned about the risk that punitive EU measures on U.S. tech firms could provoke a reaction from Trump, which might in turn cause the bloc to soften its approach. Take antitrust regulation, for example. The EU's been an active player taking action to curb U.S. tech giants' dominance \u2014 but that's something that could result in a negative response from Trump, according to Swiss VPN firm Proton's CEO Andy Yen. \"[Trump's] view is he probably wants to regulate his tech companies himself,\" Yen told CNBC in a November interview at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon, Portugal. \"He doesn't want Europe to get involved.\"\nUK copyright review\nBritain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer gives a media interview while attending the 79th United Nations General Assembly at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, U.S. September 25, 2024. Leon Neal | Via Reuters\nOne country to watch for is the U.K. Previously, Britain has shied away from introducing statutory obligations for AI model makers due to the fear that new legislation could be too restrictive. However, Keir Starmer's government has said it plans to draw up legislation for AI, although details remain thin for now. The general expectation is that the U.K. will take a more principles-based approach to AI regulation, as opposed to the EU's risk-based framework. Last month, the government dropped its first major indicator for where regulation is moving, announcing a consultation on measures to regulate the use of copyrighted content to train AI models. Copyright is a big issue for generative AI and LLMs, in particular. Most LLMs use public data from the open web to train their AI models. But that often includes examples of artwork and other copyrighted material. Artists and publishers like the New York Times allege that these systems are unfairly scraping their valuable content without consent to generate original output. To address this issue, the U.K. government is considering making an exception to copyright law for AI model training, while still allowing rights holders to opt out of having their works used for training purposes. Appian's Calkins said that the U.K. could end up being a \"global leader\" on the issue of copyright infringement by AI models, adding that the country isn't \"subject to the same overwhelming lobbying blitz from domestic AI leaders that the U.S. is.\"\nU.S.-China relations a possible point of tension\nU.S. President Donald Trump, right, and Xi Jinping, China's president, walk past members of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) during a welcome ceremony outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, on Thursday, Nov. 9, 2017. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nLastly, as world governments seek to regulate fast-growing AI systems, there's a risk geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. In his first term as president, Trump enforced a number of hawkish policy measures on China, including a decision to add Huawei to a trade blacklist restricting it from doing business with American tech suppliers. He also launched a bid to ban TikTok,which is owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, in the U.S. \u2014 although he's since softened his position on TikTok. China is racing to beat the U.S. for dominance in AI. At the same time, the U.S. has taken measures to restrict China's access to key technologies, mainly chips like those designed by Nvidia, which are required to train more advanced AI models. China has responded by attempting to build its own homegrown chip industry. Technologists worry that a geopolitical fracturing between the U.S. and China on artificial intelligence could result in other risks, such as the potential for one of the two to develop a form of AI smarter than humans. Max Tegmark, founder of the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, believes the U.S. and China could in future create a form of AI that can improve itself and design new systems without human supervision, potentially forcing both countries' governments to individually come up with rules around AI safety. \"My optimistic path forward is the U.S. and China unilaterally impose national safety standards to prevent their own companies from doing harm and building uncontrollable AGI, not to appease the rivals superpowers, but just to protect themselves,\" Tegmark told CNBC in a November interview. Governments are already trying to work together to figure out how to create regulations and frameworks around AI. In 2023, the U.K. hosted a global AI safety summit, which the U.S. and China administrations both attended, to discuss potential guardrails around the technology. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report\"\n\nResponse:",
