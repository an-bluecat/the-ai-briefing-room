Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday December 15), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nGoogle and Apple roll out emergency security updates after zero-day attacks\ndescription0:\nApple and Google have released several software updates to protect against a hacking campaign targeting an unknown number of their users.\nOn Wednesday, Google released patches for a handful of security bugs in its Chrome browser, noting that one of the bugs was being actively exploited by hackers before the company had time to patch it.\nUnusually for Google, the company provided no further details at the time.\nBut on Friday, Google updated the page to say that the bug was discovered by Apple\u2019s security engineering team and Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, whose security researchers primarily track government hackers and mercenary spyware makers, indicating that the hacking campaign may have been orchestrated by government-backed hackers.\nAt the same time, Apple released security updates for its flagship products, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Vision Pro, Apple TV, Apple Watches, and its Safari browser.\nAccording to the security advisory for iPhones and iPads, Apple patched two bugs and the company said it was aware \u201cthat this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals\u201d running devices prior to iOS 26.\nThat language is Apple\u2019s typical way of saying that it knows some of its customers and users were targeted by hackers exploiting zero-days, meaning flaws that at the time of exploitation are unknown to the software makers. Often, these are cases where government hackers used hacking tools and spyware made by companies such as NSO Group or Paragon Solutions to target journalists, dissidents, and human rights activists.\nApple and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft buys 3.6M metric tons of carbon removal from bioenergy plant\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft announced Thursday it would buy 3.6 million carbon removal credits from a biofuels plant in Louisiana owned by C2X. The plant, which is slated to begin operating in 2029, will process forestry waste into methanol, which can be used to power ships and planes and as a raw material for chemical manufacturing. Altogether, the facility will produce more than 500,000 metric tons of methanol. About 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide will be captured and stored, likely underground.\nThe purchase is one of many that Microsoft has made in the last year or so, including a 4.9 million metric ton deal with Vaulted Deep, a 3.7 million metric ton agreement with CO280, and a 7 million metric ton buy from Chestnut Carbon. Microsoft\u2019s rapid expansion of its data center footprint has imperiled its 2030 pledge to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it generates. While the company also buys large amounts of renewable and nuclear power, carbon renewal purchases like these will help offset future fossil fuel emissions.\n\ntitle2:\nData breach at credit check giant 700Credit affects at least 5.6 million\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nAt least 5.6 million people had their names, addresses, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers stolen in a data breach at 700Credit, a company that runs credit checks and identity verification services for auto dealerships across the United States.\nIn a statement on its website, the Michigan-based company blamed the October data breach on an unidentified bad actor.\nAccording to Michigan\u2019s attorney general, the hacker stole personal data collected from dealers between May and October 2025.\nThe company said it was now sending letters by mail to individuals whose information had been stolen in the data breach, which offers credit monitoring services.\n\u201cIf you get a letter from 700Credit, don\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel. \u201cIt is important that anyone affected by this data breach takes steps as soon as possible to protect their information. A credit freeze or monitoring services can go a long way in preventing fraud, and I encourage Michiganders to use the tools available to keep their identity safe.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nTrump\u2019s AI executive order promises 'one rulebook' - startups may get legal limbo instead\ndescription3:\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday evening that directs federal agencies to challenge state AI laws, arguing that startups need relief from a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of rules. Legal experts and startups meanwhile say the order could prolong uncertainty, sparking court battles that leave young companies navigating shifting state requirements while waiting to see if Congress can agree on a single national framework.\nThe order, titled \u201cEnsuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,\u201d directs the Department of Justice to set up a task force within 30 days to challenge certain state laws on the grounds that AI is interstate commerce and should be regulated federally. It gives the Commerce Department 90 days to compile a list of \u201conerous\u201d state AI laws, an assessment that could affect states\u2019 eligibility for federal funds, including broadband grants.\nThe order also asks the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to explore federal standards that could preempt state rules and instructs the administration to work with Congress on a uniform AI law.\nThe order lands amid a broader push to rein in state-by-state AI rules after efforts in Congress to pause state regulation stalled. Lawmakers in both parties have argued that without a federal standard, blocking states from acting could leave consumers exposed and companies largely unchecked.\n\u201cThis David Sacks-led executive order is a gift for Silicon Valley oligarchs who are using their influence in Washington to shield themselves and their companies from accountability,\u201d said Michael Kleinman, head of U.S. Policy at the Future of Life Institute, which focuses on reducing extreme risks from transformative technologies, in a statement.\nSacks, Trump\u2019s AI and crypto policy czar, has been a leading voice behind the administration\u2019s AI preemption push.\nEven supporters of a national framework concede the order doesn\u2019t create one. With state laws still enforceable unless courts block them or states pause enforcement, startups could face an extended transition period.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nSean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, U.K., and Ireland, tells TechCrunch that states will defend their consumer protection authority in court, with cases likely escalating to the Supreme Court.\nWhile supporters argue the order could reduce uncertainty by centralizing the fight over AI regulation in Washington, critics say the legal battles will create immediate headwinds for startups navigating conflicting state and federal demands.\n\u201cBecause startups are prioritizing innovation, they typically do not have \u2026 robust regulatory governance programs until they reach a scale that requires a program,\u201d Hart Brown, principal author of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt\u2019s Task Force on AI and Emerging Technology recommendations, told TechCrunch. \u201cThese programs can be expensive and time-consuming to meet a very dynamic regulatory environment.\u201d\nArul Nigam, co-founder at Circuit Breaker Labs, a startup that performs red-teaming for conversational and mental health AI chatbots, echoed those concerns.\n\u201cThere\u2019s uncertainty in terms of, do [AI companion and chatbot companies] have to self-regulate?\u201d Nigam told TechCrunch, noting that the patchwork of state AI laws does hurt smaller startups in his field. \u201cAre there open source standards they should adhere to? Should they continue building?\u201d\nHe added that he is hopeful Congress can move more quickly now to pass a stronger federal framework.\nAndrew Gamino-Cheong, CTO and co-founder of AI governance company Trustible, told TechCrunch the EO will backfire on AI innovation and pro-AI goals: \u201cBig Tech and the big AI startups have the funds to hire lawyers to help them figure out what to do, or they can simply hedge their bets. The uncertainty does hurt startups the most, especially those that can\u2019t get billions of funding almost at will,\u201d he said.\nHe added that legal ambiguity makes it harder to sell to risk-sensitive customers like legal teams, financial firms, and healthcare organizations, increasing sales cycles, systems work, and insurance costs. \u201cEven the perception that AI is unregulated will reduce trust in AI,\u201d which is already low and threatens adoption, Gamino-Cheong said.\nGary Kibel, a partner at Davis + Gilbert, said businesses would welcome a single national standard, but \u201can executive order is not necessarily the right vehicle to override laws that states have duly enacted.\u201d He warned that the current uncertainty leaves open two extremes: highly restrictive rules or no action at all, either of which could create a \u201cWild West\u201d that favors Big Tech\u2019s ability to absorb risk and wait things out.\nMeanwhile, Morgan Reed, president of The App Association, urged Congress to quickly enact a \u201ccomprehensive, targeted, and risk-based national AI framework. We can\u2019t have a patchwork of state AI laws, and a lengthy court fight over the constitutionality of an Executive Order isn\u2019t any better.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nRiding onboard with Rivian's race to autonomy\ndescription4:\nThe robot swerved through the cafeteria of Rivian\u2019s Palo Alto office, shelves adorned with chilled canned coffees \u2014 until it didn\u2019t. Five minutes later, a man carefully pushed it out of everyone\u2019s way, the words \u201cI\u2019m stuck\u201d flashing yellow on the poor droid\u2019s screen.\nIt was an inauspicious start to Rivian\u2019s \u201cAutonomy & AI Day,\u201d a showcase for the company\u2019s plans to make its vehicles capable of driving themselves. Rivian doesn\u2019t make the cafeteria robot and isn\u2019t responsible for its abilities, but there was a familiar message in its foibles: this stuff is hard.\nHours later, as I rode in a 2025 R1S SUV during my 15-minute demo of Rivian\u2019s new self-described \u201cLarge Driving Model,\u201d I was reminded of that message.\nThe EV equipped with the automated-driving software drove myself and two Rivian employees on a switchback route near the company\u2019s campus. As we glided past Tesla\u2019s engineering office, I noticed a Model S in front of us slow to turn into the rival company\u2019s lot. The R1S eventually noticed this, too, braking hard just before the Rivian employee nearly intervened.\nDuring my demo drive, there was one actual disengagement. The employee in the driver\u2019s seat took over as we passed through a one-lane section of road due to some tree-trimming. Minor stuff overall. But it wasn\u2019t exactly rare either; I spotted multiple other demo rides that had disengagements too.\nThe rest of the drive went well enough for software that is not ready to be shipped, especially when you consider that Rivian threw out its old rules-based driver assistance system and adopted an end-to-end approach \u2014 which is how Tesla developed Full Self-Driving (Supervised). It stopped at stoplights, it handled turns, it slowed for speed bumps, all without programmed rules telling it to do these things.\nA quiet pivot in 2021\nImage Credits:Rivian\nRivian\u2019s old system \u201cwas all very deterministic, and it was all very structured,\u201d CEO RJ Scaringe said in an interview Thursday. \u201cEverything that the vehicle did was the result of a prescribed control strategy written by humans.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nScaringe said that when Rivian saw transformer-based artificial intelligence taking off in 2021, he quietly \u201creconstituted the team and started with a clean sheet and said, let\u2019s design our self-driving platform for an AI-centric world.\u201d\nAfter spending \u201ca lot of time in the basement,\u201d Rivian launched the new ground-up driving software in 2024 on its second-generation R1 vehicles, which use Nvidia\u2019s Orin processors.\nScaringe said it was only recently that his company started to see dramatic progress \u201conce the data started really pouring in.\u201d\nRivian is betting it can train its Large Driving Model (LDM) on fleet data so quickly that it will allow the company to roll out what it calls \u201cUniversal Hands-Free\u201d driving in early 2026. That means Rivian owners will be able to take their hands off the wheel on 3.5 million miles of roads in the U.S. and Canada (so long as there are visible painted lines). In the back half of 2026 Rivian will allow \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d driving, or the consumer version of the demo we received Thursday.\nThe \u2018eyes off\u2019 to \u2018hands off\u2019 challenge\nBy the end of 2026, after Rivian has started shipping its smaller, more affordable R2 SUVs, it will ditch the Nvidia chips and outfit those vehicles with a new custom autonomy computer unveiled Thursday. That computer, plus a lidar sensor, will eventually allow drivers to take their hands and eyes off the road. True autonomy \u2014 where a driver doesn\u2019t have to worry about re-taking control of the vehicle \u2014 lies well beyond that and will largely depend on how fast Rivian can train its LDM.\nThis rollout introduces a near-term challenge for Rivian. The new autonomy computer and lidar won\u2019t be ready until months after the R2 goes on sale. If customers want a vehicle that can handle eyes-off driving (or more), they\u2019ll have to wait. But the R2 is a crucial product for Rivian, and the company needs it to sell well \u2014 especially in the wake of declining sales of its first-generation vehicles.\n\u201cWhen tech is moving as fast as it is, there\u2019s always going to be some level of obsolescence, and so what we want to do here is to be really direct\u201d about what\u2019s coming, Scaringe said. The early R2s will still get Rivian\u2019s promised \u201cpoint-to-point\u201d driving, which will be based on the new software and will be hands-off but not eyes-off.\n\u201cSo [if] you\u2019re buying an R2 and you buy it in the first nine months, it\u2019s just going to be more constrained,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what will happen is some customers will say \u2018that matters a lot to me, and I\u2019m going to wait.\u2019 And some will say \u2018I want the newest, best things now, and I\u2019m going to get the R2 now, and maybe I\u2019ll trade it in a year or two, and I\u2019ll get the next version later. Fortunately, there\u2019s so much demand backlog for R2 that we think, by being upfront with this, customers can make the decision themselves.\u201d\n\u201cIn a perfect world, everything times at the same time, but the timeline of the vehicle and the timeline of the autonomy platform are just not perfectly aligned,\u201d he said.\nWhen I first interviewed Scaringe in 2018, before Rivian even showed what its vehicles looked like, he shared a goal that still rattles around my head. He wanted to make Rivian\u2019s vehicles so capable of driving themselves that: \u201cif you go for a hike, and you start at one point and you finish at another point, you have the vehicle meet you at the end of the trail.\u201d\nIt was the kind of pie-in-the-sky promise about self-driving cars that was all the rage seven years ago, but it stuck with me at least because it was something that felt true to Rivian\u2019s whole brand of aspirational adventure.\nScaringe told me Thursday he still thinks it\u2019s possible for Rivian to enable a use case like that in the next few years. It certainly won\u2019t happen until the company tests and builds its more-capable R2 vehicles, which is at least a year away in a best-case scenario.\n\u201cWe could [do that]. It\u2019s not been a huge focus,\u201d he said. That could change as the company gets closer to level 4 autonomy, though, since by then the company will have its LDM trained on trickier roads without guiding features like lane lines.\n\u201cThen, it becomes a bit of a like, what\u2019s the ODD [operational design domain]? Dirt roads, off road? Easy,\u201d he said. Just don\u2019t expect a Rivian driving itself up Hell\u2019s Gate in Moab.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not putting any resources into rock crawling autonomously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in terms of getting to the trail head? For sure.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
