Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The software giant has invested more than $13 billion in the AI lab, which is currently looking to raise additional funding at a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nIn September, Microsoft and OpenAI renegotiated some of the terms of their deal when OpenAI restructured into a public benefit corporation.\nAs part of that deal, OpenAI agreed to buy another $250 billion of Azure services. That commitment shows on Microsoft\u2019s books as \u201ccommercial remaining performance obligations,\u201d or contracts that Microsoft has that have not yet been paid out. Those obligations leaped to $625 billion from $392 billion in the previous quarter. Microsoft said that 45% of that is from OpenAI.\nAnthropic got a shout-out in the quarterly earnings, too, in helping boost Microsoft\u2019s anticipated future revenue in the form of commercial bookings, which grew 230%. In November, Microsoft announced that it was investing $5 billion into Anthropic and the AI lab had signed up for $30 billion of Azure compute capacity, with intent to buy more later.\nBut Microsoft is also spending big to feed the AI machine. It spent $37.5 billion in the quarter on capital expenditures, two-thirds of which were for what Microsoft called \u201cshort-lived\u201d assets: primarily the GPUs and CPUs for its cloud Azure to serve AI.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe company reported $81.3 billion in revenue (Wall Street analysts expected $80.27 billion, so that\u2019s a solid beat), up 17% over the year-ago period. Its Microsoft Cloud revenue hit $50 billion this quarter for the first time. All of Microsoft\u2019s business units increased by double-digit percentages over the year-ago quarter with the exception of Windows devices, which gained 1% (essentially flat), and Xbox content and services, which were down 5%.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta burned $19 billion on VR last year, and 2026 won\u2019t be any better\ndescription1:\nEarlier this month, Meta laid off 10% of the staff for Reality Labs, its virtual reality unit, reportedly cutting as many as 1,000 employees. Now, in a development that seems directly related, the company has revealed that the unit lost many billions of dollars last year.\nOn Wednesday, Meta\u2019s earnings report showed that its embattled virtual reality business had lost some $19.1 billion in 2025, which is slightly more than it lost in 2024 (that year, the losses hovered around $17.7 billion). In its fourth quarter, the unit posted a loss of $6.2 billion, the report shows.\nThose losses stood against what the unit generated in sales: $955 million in Q4 and some $2.2 billion throughout 2025.\nDuring the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg struck a tone of optimism for his company\u2019s VR team while noting that losses in 2026 are expected to be very much the same.\n\u201cFor Reality Labs, we are directing most of our investment towards glasses and wearables going forward, while focusing on making Horizon a massive success on Mobile and making VR a profitable ecosystem over the coming years,\u201d Zuckerberg said, during the call. However, the CEO noted that losses were expected to continue. \u201cI expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year,\u201d Zuckerberg said, while noting that this year would \u201clikely be the peak, as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward.\u201d\nWhen Meta announced a pivot toward the \u201cmetaverse\u201d in 2021, the move was regarded with a certain amount of skepticism and, during its first year of VR efforts, the company faced harsh criticism \u2014 even being referred to as an \u201cinternational laughingstock.\u201d Nearly half a decade later, that skepticism hasn\u2019t exactly subsided. As the VR business continues to lose money and Meta continues an aggressive pivot away from VR and toward AI, it\u2019s unclear what exactly will turn the ailing business around.\nLast week, CNBC reported that, in addition to the layoffs, Meta had plans to shutter a number of its VR studios \u2014 another sign that the company\u2019s interest in virtual reality is waning. The company also recently announced that it would be retiring its standalone Workrooms app \u2014 which the company had pitched to office workers as a VR space that could be used to hold meetings.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla is killing off the Model S and Model X\ndescription2:\nTesla is ending production of the Model S sedan and Model X SUV, CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call.\nThe company will make the final versions of both electric vehicles next quarter, he said, adding that his company will offer support for existing Model S and Model X owners \u201cfor as long as people have the vehicles.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge, because we\u2019re really moving into a future that is based on autonomy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\u201d\nThe Model S and Model X are both built at the company\u2019s Fremont, California factory. Once production ends, Tesla will build Optimus robots in the same factory space, according to Musk. Production of Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, which is made at the company\u2019s factory outside of Austin, will continue.\nTesla launched the Model S in 2012, and it\u2019s regarded as the first car that made electric vehicles widely appealing. The Model X was Tesla\u2019s second major electric vehicle program.\nTesla always intended for its more affordable models \u2014 the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV \u2014 to greatly outsell their predecessors.\nBut sales of both models have flatlined in recent years, despite interior and exterior refreshes along the way. Tesla has faced increased competition in the luxury EV space from legacy automakers, as well as upstarts like Rivian and Lucid Motors.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cSo that is slightly sad, but it\u2019s\u2026 it is time to bring the S and X programs to an end,\u201d Musk said.\nTesla\u2019s first ground-up design\nThe Model S was not Tesla\u2019s first car \u2014 that title goes to the original Roadster. But the Model S was the first car Tesla created from the ground up.\nThat helped it ditch a lot of the tradeoffs of the Roadster, and paved the way for the Model S to become one of the first true mass-market electric vehicles.\nTesla launched the sedan in 2012 with a base price of $57,400. It had a floor-mounted battery that helped make it roomier and far more dynamic to drive than the few other all-electric vehicles that were available at the time.\nTesla also offered the Model S with multiple battery sizes, allowing customers to pay up for more EV range.\nThe car was instantly popular, with Tesla collecting more than 10,000 reservations for it by the time the first deliveries started in June of that year. By 2013, it had become MotorTrend\u2019s car of the year, beating out the best gas cars from around the world.\n\u201cAt its core, the Tesla Model S is simply a damned good car you happen to plug in to refuel,\u201d MotorTrend wrote.\nTesla iterated on the Model S in the years that followed. It changed up battery options \u2014 at one point even offering larger battery packs with range that was software-limited, in a bid to get customers to adopt a sort of \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d attitude.\nThe Model S was also the first Tesla to get \u201cLudicrous Mode,\u201d which made it possible to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h in just 2.8 seconds. It was an exhilarating feature that also became one of Tesla\u2019s sharpest word-of-mouth marketing tools.\nTesla kept improving the Model S, giving it industry-leading range that still beats most other EVs and an overall exterior and interior refresh in 2021. But by that point the company\u2019s success had skyrocketed on the backs of the much cheaper Model 3 and Model Y.\nThe Faberg\u00e9 SUV\nThe Model X was not so straightforward.\nFirst teased before the release of the Model S in 2012, the Model X SUV didn\u2019t hit the streets until 2015. When it did, it arrived with overly complex \u201cFalcon Wing\u201d rear doors that folded up.\nThese made it extremely easy to get in and out of the Model X. But the doors \u2014 along with the rest of the SUV \u2014 proved to be very hard to build at scale with any reliable quality over the years. Musk eventually called it the \u201cFaberg\u00e9 of cars.\u201d It was a nod to the luxury stylings and features, but also to the Model X\u2019s brittle nature.\nThe Model X still sold fairly well alongside the S, and it also received a big refresh in 2021. But production problems plagued the new version, too, and Musk admitted in early 2022 that Tesla made a mistake by halting production before the redesigned Model X was ready to be made at scale.\nA long time coming\nIn hindsight, the retirement of the Model S and Model X have been a long time coming.\nMusk himself said in 2019 that Tesla was still making these \u201cniche\u201d vehicles more for \u201csentimental reasons than anything else.\u201d\n\u201cThey are really of minor importance to our future,\u201d Musk said at the time.\nAt that point, Tesla was still selling tens of thousands of Model S and Model X SUVs per quarter. But the company\u2019s first truly new model was on the horizon: the Cybertruck.\nRevealed in 2019, Tesla had big plans for the Cybertruck. The company stated it would sell a base version for $40,000, and make 250,000 of them a year. Delays brought on by the Covid pandemic, along with the vehicle\u2019s complex new design, meant the vehicle hit the market far later than anticipated.\nOnce it did hit the road, the Cybertruck bombed \u2014 although Tesla continues to publicly support it, including during Wednesday\u2019s earnings call. A supposed backlog of 2 million orders never materialized, and neither did the $40,000 base price. Tesla has struggled to sell just a few thousand of them per quarter ever since.\nThe Cybertruck\u2019s failure likely gave the Model S and Model X some cover. Not only did the two legacy EVs help slightly offset the garish truck\u2019s terrible popularity, Tesla also bucketed the three vehicles as \u201cother models\u201d when reporting quarterly sales figures, making it hard to say just how badly the Cybertruck was doing.\nBut Tesla is now a company aimed at solving autonomy in cars, and in robots, according to Musk. That\u2019s apparently what ultimately did in the Model S and Model X.\nThey may have been of \u201cminor importance\u201d to [Tesla\u2019s] future seven years ago. But they will always be crucial to the company\u2019s early years, and the construction of Musk as an uber-rich businessman who now looms over modern society.\n\ntitle3:\nAI security startup Outtake raises $40M from Iconiq, Satya Nadella, Bill Ackman, and other big names\ndescription3:\nOuttake, which makes an agentic cybersecurity platform to help enterprises detect, investigate, and take down identity fraud, has raised a $40 million Series B round of funding.\nWhile that might not sound like a lot given the huge sums some AI companies are raising, the names involved in this financing reads like a tech industry who\u2019s who.\nThe round was led by Iconiq\u2019s Murali Joshi, who helped lead the firm\u2019s investments in companies like Anthropic, Datadog, Drata, 1Password, among others.\nAngels who invested include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella; Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora; Pershing Square Holdings CEO Bill Ackman; Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar; Anduril co-founder Trae Stephens; Former OpenAI VP Bob McGrew; Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and Former AT&T CEO John Donovan. Whew!\nThe reason for the excitement? Outtake, founded in 2023 by a former Palantir engineer, Alex Dhillon, has found a way to automate what has largely been the manual problem of spotting and taking down digital identity posers: impersonation accounts, malicious domains posing as the company\u2019s, rogue apps, fraudulent ads, and more. This problem has grown even more difficult because AI has enabled attackers to be more convincing and faster in their efforts.\n\u201cWe kept hearing whispers in our network about an AI company that was finally solving digital misrepresentation at scale. Honestly, we were skeptical,\u201d Joshi told TechCrunch. \u201cHistorically, detection and takedown was (and to some extent even today) a manual, human-intensive process that couldn\u2019t keep up with the speed of the internet.\u201d\nBut once Iconiq looked at the product and did its due diligence with customers, the investor became a believer, he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve turned a \u2018human problem\u2019 into a \u2018software problem.\u2019 Seeing AI take down digital frauds in real time is a game-changer for brand safety,\u201d he said.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nDhillon told TechCrunch his experience at Palantir is what led him to gaining so many notable angels. \u201cI worked directly for Shyam Sankar at Palantir when I was part of the experimental product team,\u201d he explained. This led him to meet many of the Palantir powers, current and former, including Stephens, who worked there in its earlier years. (Stephens is also a VC for Peter Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund.) One introduction led to another which led to moguls writing checks.\nOuttake names among its customers OpenAI, Pershing Square, AppLovin, and federal agencies. OpenAI even profiled the company in July 2025 as an example of an agentic startup built on its reasoning models.\nThe company says it has seen major growth all around, with annual recurring revenue increasing sixfold year-over-year and its customer base growing more than tenfold. Last year alone, Outtake says, its systems scanned 20 million potential cyberattacks.\n\ntitle4:\nMark Zuckerberg says a future without smart glasses is \u2018hard to imagine\u2019\ndescription4:\nMark Zuckerberg spoke about his ambitions for Meta\u2019s AI smart glasses business during Meta\u2019s Q4 2025 earnings call on Wednesday.\nAfter pivoting its Reality Labs investments away from the metaverse, Meta is doubling down on its production of AI wearables, as well as its own AI models.\n\u201cBillions of people wear glasses or contacts for vision correction. And I think that we\u2019re at a moment similar to when smartphones arrived, and it was clearly only a matter of time until all those flip phones became smartphones,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a world in several years where most glasses that people wear aren\u2019t AI glasses.\u201d\nHe added that sales of Meta\u2019s glasses tripled within the last year, and he believes that they\u2019re \u201csome of the fastest growing consumer electronics in history.\u201d\nTake Zuckerberg\u2019s outlook with a grain of salt. After all, he also thought that we would go to work and hang out with our friends in the metaverse \u2014 legs optional \u2014 and that didn\u2019t work out.\nBut based on how tech\u2019s biggest players are allocating their money and effort, it does seem like AI glasses are poised for a big moment, even if it\u2019s not on the scale of the smartphone.\nGoogle is expected to launch a line of smart glasses this year, following a $150 million deal with Warby Parker. Apple is also reportedly planning to unveil smart glasses in the next year or two, moving some staff to that project instead of working on a lighter Vision Pro, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Snap announced Tuesday that it would spin its AR glasses, Specs, into a new subsidiary to allow for \u201cgreater operational focus and alignment.\u201d\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Apple is also rumored to be working on an AirTag-sized AI device \u2014 though hopefully those efforts turn out better than the Humane AI pin.\nFor now, Meta is leading the way in pushing smart glasses to market, with several different models already on sale.
