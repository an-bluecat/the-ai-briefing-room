Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

OpenAI stands at $500 billion, while Anthropic reportedly surged last month to $350 billion following major investments from Microsoft and Nvidia, up from $183 billion just months earlier.\nThese companies can now achieve public-market-scale valuations while remaining private, fueled by secondary sales that provide liquidity without the scrutiny of quarterly earnings reports.\nSpaceX, founded in 2002, dominates commercial rocket launches and operates Starlink, its satellite internet service with over 8 million customers globally as of November.\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo to issue software recall over how robotaxis behave around school buses\ndescription1:\nWaymo plans to voluntarily issue a software recall with federal safety regulators related to how its robotaxis operate around school buses, the Alphabet-owned company told TechCrunch.\nThe voluntary software recall will be filed early next week, according to the company. Waymo said as soon as the issue was identified it updated its software on November 17. The company contends this update has meaningfully improved performance to a level better than human drivers in this important area.\nSoftware recalls have become more common in the age of modern passenger vehicles \u2014 and now robotaxis \u2014 in which operations are handled by software. These updates, or fixes, are often made prior to the official recall but still carry weight when filed with the federal government.\nWaymo\u2019s decision follows increased scrutiny by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and criticism by officials in Atlanta and Austin over how its robotaxis perform around school buses.\nNHTSA\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) opened its initial investigation into Waymo in October after seeing footage of its autonomous vehicle maneuvering around a stopped school bus \u2014 with its stop sign extended and lights flashing \u2014 that was unloading kids in Atlanta. In that incident, a Waymo robotaxi crossed perpendicularly in front of the school bus from its right side. The autonomous vehicle then turned left around the front of the bus before traveling down the street.\nOther similar incidents popped up in Austin, where the company also operates a robotaxi service with partner Uber. Austin School District officials contend, in a letter available on NHTSA\u2019s website, that at least five of these occurred after Waymo said it updated its software.\nThe agency sent a letter December 3 to Waymo asking for more information about its self-driving system and operations following reports from the Austin School District that its robotaxis illegally passed school buses 19 times this year. Regulators requested detailed information about its fifth-generation self-driving system and operations.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cWhile we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences twelve times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,\u201d Waymo Chief Safety Officer Mauricio Pe\u00f1a said in an emailed statement. \u201cAs a result, we have made the decision to file a voluntary software recall with NHTSA related to appropriately slowing and stopping in these scenarios. We will continue analyzing our vehicles\u2019 performance and making necessary fixes as part of our commitment to continuous improvement.\u201d\nNo injuries occurred related to the vehicle behavior addressed by this recall, according to the company, which has emphasized that safety is its top priority and it will continue to work with NHTSA.\nThe company says it will continue to investigate, track, and implement more updates as needed.\nWaymo made a voluntary software recall earlier this year as well as two in 2024, including one that was issued after a Waymo vehicle in Phoenix, driving without a human safety operator, collided with a telephone pole in an alley during a low-speed pullover maneuver.\n\ntitle2:\nFeds find more complaints of Tesla's FSD running red lights and crossing lanes\ndescription2:\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has identified at least 80 instances in which Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software violated road rules by running red lights or crossing into the wrong lane, according to a new letter sent to the automaker this week.\nNHTSA said in the letter it has received 62 complaints from Tesla drivers, 14 reports submitted by Tesla, and four media reports that describe potential violations. That\u2019s up from around 50 violations NHTSA cited when it opened an investigation into the behavior in October.\nThe federal safety agency\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) is probing whether Tesla\u2019s driver assistance software can \u201caccurately detect and appropriately respond to traffic signals, signs and lane markings,\u201d according to the letter. ODI is also evaluating whether Tesla\u2019s software is providing sufficient warnings to drivers in these situations. Tesla\u2019s responses are due January 19, 2026.\nThe increase in complaints is notable in part because the original batch reported by ODI in October included multiple reports from one particular intersection in Joppa, Maryland. Tesla told the agency at the time that it had already \u201ctaken action to address the issue at this intersection.\u201d The agency didn\u2019t say where, geographically, these newly reported incidents took place. Tesla heavily redacts its own submissions to the agency.\nThe new letter was sent to Tesla the same week that CEO Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that the latest version of FSD will allow drivers to text and drive while using the driver assistance software, which is illegal in nearly every state. NHTSA has not responded to requests for comment about Musk\u2019s statement.\nThe letter is meant to kick off the discovery process for NHTSA, and as such it details a number of requests for information the agency has made to Tesla. For instance, the agency is asking for data on how many Tesla vehicles are equipped with FSD, as well as how often the software is engaged. ODI is also asking Tesla to turn over any customer complaints it has received regarding these specific problems with FSD, including from fleet operators and from any lawsuits or third-party arbitration proceedings.\nThis is the second investigation that NHTSA has opened into Tesla\u2019s FSD software. In October 2024, the agency began a probe into how FSD handles low-visibility situations like fog or extreme sunlight.\n\ntitle3:\nSources: AI synthetic research startup Aaru raised a Series A at a $1B 'headline' valuation\ndescription3:\nAaru, a startup that provides near-instant customer research by using AI to simulate user behavior, has raised a Series A led by Redpoint Ventures, according to three people familiar with the deal.\nThe funding round included different valuation tiers, these people said. Although some equity was acquired at a $1 billion valuation, a lower valuation for other investors resulted in a blended valuation below $1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal. Multi-tier valuations within the same round are an unusual mechanism in venture capital, but investors say they are becoming increasingly common for desirable AI startups in the current market. This approach allows the company to report a higher \u201cheadline\u201d valuation while simultaneously offering better terms to specific investors.\nAaru and Redpoint Ventures didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe exact round size couldn\u2019t be learned, but one person said that it is above $50 million. Another source said that the startup is growing quickly, but its annual recurring revenue (ARR) is still below $10 million.\nAaru was founded in March 2024 by Cameron Fink, Ned Koh, and John Kessler, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\nThe startup\u2019s prediction model generates thousands of AI agents that simulate human behavior using public and proprietary data. Aaru replaces traditional market research methods, which generally include surveys and focus groups, by using agents to predict how groups in specific demographics or geographies will respond to future events.\nThe company\u2019s customer partners include Accenture, EY, Interpublic Group, and political campaigns. Last year, Aaru AI\u2019s polling methodology accurately predicted the outcome of the New York Democratic primary, according to reporting by Semafor.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAaru competes with other social simulation startups, including CulturePulse and Simile, as well as startups that apply AI to query humans about their product preferences, such as Listen Labs, Keplar, and Outset.\nThe startup raised an undisclosed amount of seed and pre-seed capital from investors, including A*, Abstract Ventures, General Catalyst, Accenture Ventures, and Z Fellows, according to people familiar with the deal and PitchBook data.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta acquires AI device startup Limitless\ndescription4:\nLimitless, the AI startup formerly known as Rewind, has been acquired by Meta, the company announced Friday on its website. The company, which made an AI-powered pendant to record your conversations, says it will no longer sell its hardware devices and will maintain support for its existing customers for a year.\nCustomers will no longer have to pay a subscription fee and will be moved to the Unlimited Plan for the time being. Other functionality will be wound down, including its non-pendant software \u201cRewind,\u201d which recorded users\u2019 desktop activity and turned it into a searchable record.\nThe startup, founded by Brett Bejcek and Dan Siroker, the co-founder and former chief executive of Optimizely, pivoted to become an AI device maker last year, offering its Limitless pendant for $99. The wearable could attach to your shirt like a wireless mic or be worn like a necklace. The device is one of several AI hardware devices on the market, including another (not very well-received) AI pendant known as Friend.\nAccording to Limitless\u2019 announcement, the company shares in Meta\u2019s vision to \u201cbring personal superintelligence to everyone,\u201d which includes building AI-enabled wearables. (Meta is focused for now on AR/AI glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta, and its in-lens AI glasses, the Meta Ray-Ban Display.) Limitless said it will help bring that vision to life \u2014 which likely means supporting Meta\u2019s existing products, not helping Meta add an AI pendant to its lineup.\nThe company hinted that the increased competition in the market made it difficult for it to compete, especially as the larger players like OpenAI and Meta are developing their own hardware devices, too.\n\u201cWhen we started Limitless five years ago, the world was very different,\u201d wrote Siroker in the announcement. \u201cAI was a pipe dream to many. Hardware startups were considered unfundable, and a business that did both AI and hardware would have been considered ludicrous. But today is different. The world has changed. We\u2019re no longer working on a weird fringe idea. We\u2019re building a future that now seems inevitable. We\u2019re not alone.\u201d\nMeta shared the following statement with TechCrunch via email: \u201cWe\u2019re excited that Limitless will be joining Meta to help accelerate our work to build AI-enabled wearables.\u201d The tech giant didn\u2019t share further information about its plans, beyond noting that the team will work in the wearables organization of Reality Labs.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.
