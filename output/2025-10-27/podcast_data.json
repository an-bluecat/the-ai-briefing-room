Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The job cuts are expected to affect various sectors, including human resources, devices and services, operations, and others.\nAmazon hasn\u2019t eliminated this many jobs since 27,000 were cut beginning in late 2022.\nIn recent years, Amazon has made smaller job cuts across different divisions. In January, Amazon reduced a small number of positions in its Communications and Sustainability departments.\nThis also follows a CNBC report discussing a memo from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, which stated that, as Amazon continues to implement more AI agents, fewer corporate jobs will be needed.\nAmazon didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nZoom CEO Eric Yuan says AI will shorten our workweek\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nZoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan believes that AI assistants will finally allow us to shorten our workweek. Speaking on stage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday, Yuan discussed his videoconferencing product\u2019s embrace of AI, which includes a \u201cdigital twin\u201d feature where an AI avatar can speak for you.\nYuan began using his AI avatar in an earnings call with investors this year, demonstrating the technology\u2019s potential and ability to push the \u201cboundaries of communication,\u201d he said.\nAt Disrupt, the exec emphasized spending a lot of time talking about AI and the right products to bring to market.\nWhen asked about what he\u2019s investing in, he responded, \u201cAI, AI, and AI.\u201d The technology is the subject of multi-hour strategy meetings, as Zoom believes in its potential to transform work.\nYuan also suggested there were many more use cases for AI companions, beyond just video conferencing stand-ins. He offered a potential future scenario where two business execs were negotiating a contract over Zoom.\nInstead of being on a call for a long time, they could send their digital twins to work together on the plan first, Yuan said.\nHe also spoke of how AI could assist with email, checking your messages for you, and help you figure out what was important and in need of a response.\nPlus, Yuan believes that AI could enhance Zoom\u2019s broader suite of solutions, which includes things like an online whiteboard and collaborative docs.\n\u201cToday, I need a manually focus on all those products to get work done. Eventually, AI will help,\u201d Yuan said.\n\u201cBy doing that, we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?\u2026 Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That\u2019s a goal,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle2:\nWaymo's co-CEO on the challenge of scaling robotaxis safely\ndescription2:\nWaymo\u2019s co-CEO, Tekedra Mawakana, had a clear message during her interview on the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 stage Monday: \u201cIt is imperative that we scale.\u201d\nMawakana was speaking in the context of how Waymo balances fundraising (and burning through that money) with eventually achieving profitability. But she was also clear in the interview that she believes Waymo can increase road safety by reaching that scale.\nAll this helps explain why the company has been on an expansion tear this year and expects to launch in many more U.S. cities \u2014 D.C., Miami, Denver, Dallas, Seattle, and Nashville \u2014 as well as in London in 2026. It\u2019s a furious pace that has seen the autonomous vehicle company leverage multiple partnerships with companies such as Uber, Lyft, and Avis.\n\u201cBy the end of 2026, you should expect us to be offering 1 million trips per week,\u201d she said.\nMawakana spent a lot of time during the interview with TechCrunch transportation editor Kirsten Korosec talking about the challenges of safely reaching that kind of scale.\nThe Waymo co-CEO maintained that the company is operating at a level that is safer than the typical human driver. And while she didn\u2019t name names, she took a shot at competitors, saying they aren\u2019t doing enough to prove that their autonomous vehicle technology is truly safe.\n\u201cIt is incumbent upon [them] to be transparent about what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.\u201d\nHer comments come as the company continues to iron out edge cases during its expansion \u2014 with one of the most recent incidents coming in Atlanta, Georgia, where a Waymo vehicle pulled out in front of a stopped school bus, leading to an investigation from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nWaymo itself recently released a report claiming its vehicles are already five times safer than most human drivers, and 12 times safer with respect to pedestrians.\nStill, Waymo vehicles have been caught making a number of head-scratching decisions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to recognize, it\u2019s not going to be perfection, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t be accountable for transparency,\u201d Mawakana said onstage. \u201cI think \u2026 we really worry as a company about those days. You know, we don\u2019t say whether, we say when, and we plan for them.\u201d\nMawakana also said Waymo doesn\u2019t think in terms of \u201chow many [incidents] are allowable.\u201d\n\u201cWe know they\u2019re going to happen because our cars are on the road with humans, and unfortunately, right now, the state of the roads and the state of human driving is there is a lot of deaths, and there are a lot of injuries being caused on the roadways,\u201d she said.\nAnd when asked whether the public would accept a death caused by a robotaxi in the face of the promise of greater safety, Mawakana said: \u201cI think that society will.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nCEO of Alphabet's X, Astro Teller, on what makes a moonshot\ndescription3:\nAstro Teller, CEO of X, Alphabet\u2019s \u201cmoonshot factory,\u201d where the company incubates the nearly impossible, shared a look into what makes a moonshot and detailed the company\u2019s \u201cfail fast\u201d mantra at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Monday.\nNotable companies that started out as moonshots from X\u2019s moonshot factory include Waymo and Wing.\nTeller noted that X has a \u201c2% hit rate,\u201d which means that most of the things the company tries don\u2019t work out, and that\u2019s okay.\nHe said X defines a moonshot as having three specific components. The first is that it needs to attempt to solve a huge problem in the world. Second, there needs to be some kind of product or service that, however unlikely, would make the problem go away. Last, there has to be a sort of breakthrough technology that would provide a glimmer of hope at solving that huge, real-world problem.\n\u201cIf you worked at X, and you would just come up with a teleporter, you\u2019ve got a moonshot story hypothesis, I would say, awesome, here\u2019s a tiny amount of money, go see if you can prove that it\u2019s wrong, because it probably is,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to make it work. I want you to get information about whether this is really a once-in-a-generation opportunity or not, and it\u2019s okay if the answer is no.\u201d\nTeller went on to note that if someone is proposing a moonshot, and it sounds reasonable, the company isn\u2019t interested, because that, by definition, wouldn\u2019t be a moonshot. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad idea; that\u2019s just not what X is looking for.\n\u201cIf you propose something and it sounds pretty wild, that has those three components that I just described, and it\u2019s a testable hypothesis, for a small amount of money, we can learn something about whether it\u2019s a little bit more crazy than we thought, or a little bit less crazy than we thought,\u201d Teller said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a little bit more crazy than we thought, cool, high five, let\u2019s put a bullet in its head and move on. And if it\u2019s a little bit less crazy than we thought, awesome, here\u2019s a tiny bit more money. Go try to find the next opportunity to kill it and repeat.\u201d\nTeller emphasized that in order to do moonshots, you need to have equal amounts of audacity and humility.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have really high audacity, you won\u2019t start on these really unlikely journeys,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, if you have anything less than really high humility, you\u2019ll go luminously far down that unlikely journey.\u201d\nX starts more than 100 things every year, and while 2% of them make it to exit five or six years later, 44% of all of the money that the company spends is on things that graduate and are \u201coutrageously good,\u201d Teller said. He says this is because X \u201ckills all the bad ideas pretty early in the process.\u201d\nTeller stated that people can learn innovation, noting that every single person was creative when they were children, but that we end up unlearning things that are useful, maybe even necessary for radical innovation. However, he says it\u2019s possible to find these things again by creating an environment where you don\u2019t feel stupid to go find them.\n\ntitle4:\nDefense startup Pytho AI wants to turbocharge military mission planning and it will show off its tech at Disrupt 2025\ndescription4:\nPytho AI is coming out of stealth with an ambitious pitch to the Department of Defense: turn mission planning that takes warfighters days into a process measured in minutes.\nThe startup was founded by Michael Mearn, a former Marine human-intelligence officer whose teams located insurgents, IEDs, weapons, and other intel. The idea for the company came from watching planners spend days building mission plans for a single operation, he told TechCrunch. Pytho AI is a Top 20 Startup Battlefield finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.\nAs he explains it, war plans aren\u2019t just for large-scale conflicts, what one might think of as \u201cwar games.\u201d Instead, everyday service members execute plans for everything from disaster preparation to flight missions.\nMearn saw the status quo firsthand. In Afghanistan, his team built plans the same way much of the military still does today: by assembling maps, diagrams, tables, and text in Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, then sending them up the chain for review.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too slow for how fast the battlefield now moves,\u201d he said. There can be more than 150 products and artifacts created during the planning process, and a team of five could spend roughly 12,000 minutes of labor over five days on one plan \u2014 of which, 70% goes into data management rather than strategy.\nEven worse, plans go stale quickly, and time and resource constraints often mean missions aren\u2019t updated or compared against alternatives.\nMearn used a conflict in the Indo-Pacific as an example. \u201cThere is a plan that exists that we\u2019re supposed to be constantly updating based off new information and ready to enact at any time. That should be dynamic. Is it in reality?\u201d\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAfter leaving the Marines, Mearn went to Harvard Business School before going to Silicon Valley, where he worked on Facebook\u2019s misinformation team during the 2018 midterms. He later led product at a handful of startups. He and CTO Shah Hossain founded Pytho in the summer of 2023 after talking with people still serving in the military and hearing that mission planning remained a major pain point.\nThe startup is only four people, split between Washington, D.C., and San Francisco. But its ambitions are to change mission planning for every service member in the armed forces through a streamlined software product. Rather than a chatbot interface, it uses a template structure that\u2019s well understood by service members today, powered by a system of AI agents to generate plans in any format.\nThe company\u2019s first demo centers on mission analysis, a process with 48 steps that are generally time-intensive but now take mere minutes to complete.\nHumans stay in the loop, and after generating the draft, Pytho\u2019s software invites planners to edit where needed. The company included features like confidence scores to contextualize the information, and the software can integrate with Microsoft products to align with existing workflows.\nMearn emphasized that they are building the product to ensure a range of end users can access it, whether that be 18-year-old specialists fresh out of high school to two-star generals with decades of service behind them.\nOf course, breaking into the Department of Defense is notoriously challenging. Pytho claims it already has work with \u201calmost every single service\u201d by embedding company engineers with units to co-build planning workflows.\n\u201cService members out there need people that are dedicated solely to building these plans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would almost be a disservice to not have a company dedicated to this.\u201d\nIf you want to learn from Pytho AI firsthand, and see dozens of additional pitches, attend valuable workshops, and make the connections that drive business results, head here to learn more about this year\u2019s Disrupt, this week in San Francisco.\"\n\nResponse:",
