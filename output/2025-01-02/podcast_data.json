Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Here are the key numbers:\nTotal deliveries Q4 2024: 495,570\nTotal production Q4 2024: 459,445\nTotal annual deliveries 2024: 1,789,226\nTotal annual production 2024: 1,773,443\nResults for the quarter represented the first annual drop in delivery numbers for Tesla, which reported 1.81 million deliveries in 2023. It reported 484,507 deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nTesla shares fell by as much as 7% in trading on Thursday.\nAnalysts had expected Tesla to report deliveries in the quarter of 504,770, including 474,000 Model 3 and Model Y EVs, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by StreetAccount. Tesla sent some investors a company-compiled delivery consensus of 506,763 vehicles, based on a survey of 26 analysts. A widely followed independent Tesla researcher, who publishes as Troy Teslike, predicted deliveries of 501,000.\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications.\nThe fourth-quarter report comes after a huge late-year rally in Tesla's stock, which finished 2024 up 63%. In mid-December, the shares reached a record, eclipsing their prior all-time high from 2021.\nIt was a big turnaround from the first quarter, when the stock plummeted 29%, its worst period since 2022, as the company contended with declining sales despite price cuts and incentives for buyers. On the company's first-quarter earnings call in April, CEO Elon Musk told investors that while he expected \"higher sales this year than last year,\" the growth rate would slow from 38% in 2023.\nThe biggest story at Tesla in the back half of the year was Musk's role in President-elect Donald Trump's election campaign. Musk, the world's richest person, poured in around $277 million to promote Trump and other Republican candidates, and spent weeks on the road campaigning in swing states.\n\ntitle1:\nCryptocurrencies jump to start 2025, bitcoin rises back above $97,000\ndescription1:\nRepresentations of cryptocurrency Bitcoin are seen in this illustration taken Nov. 25, 2024.\nCryptocurrencies rose to start the year, rebounding from recent losses as investor optimism returned to the market.\nThe price of bitcoin rose 3% to $97,234.80 Thursday, bringing its new year gain to nearly 4% when counting trading from the Jan. 1 session.\nThe CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader cryptocurrency market, advanced more than 3%. The token tied to Solana , the popular Ethereum competitor, led the gains with a nearly 7% increase. Crypto stocks Coinbase and MicroStrategy climbed 3.5% each.\n\ntitle2:\nNew details emerge in Cybertruck explosion outside Trump hotel in Vegas that left 1 dead, 7 injured\ndescription2:\nA Tesla Cybertruck that exploded and burst into flames Wednesday morning just outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas has left one person dead and seven people injured, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD).\nMatthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old man who was an active duty U.S. Army Green Beret from Colorado Springs, has been named as the primary suspect by investigators. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill, who provided new details during a Thursday media briefing, said Liveslberger\u2019s military ID, credit cards, and passport were discovered in the Cybertruck. Livelsberger also has been identified as the person who rented the Cybertruck, and video at various Tesla Supercharging stations between Colorado and Las Vegas identify him as the driver.\nMcMahill stopped short of conclusively naming Livelsberger as the individual who was killed and said they will wait for DNA to confirm his identity. The sheriff did say that the individual died of a self-inflicted gunshot moments before the explosion. The handgun was registered to Livelsberger.\nScreenshot: Las VEgas Police Department; Image shared during press conference\nAn eyewitness who captured video of the fire from inside the hotel lobby and posted it on X said the vehicle pulled up outside and then \u201cblew up.\u201d The video, and others like it, quickly spread on X.\nLaw enforcement continues to investigate a number of leads, McMahill said. Gov. Joe Lombardo said his office was coordinating with LVMPD and partner agencies.\nDuring both media briefings, McMahill referenced the fatal attack that occurred Wednesday morning in New Orleans that killed at least 15 people. He didn\u2019t make an implicit connection to the attack, but said law enforcement was taking precautions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very well aware of what has happened in New Orleans with the event that occurred there, and the number of victims there, and the additional IEDs,\u201d he said during the Wednesday afternoon press conference. \u201cSo as you can imagine, with an explosion here on iconic Las Vegas Boulevard, we are taking all of the precautions that we need to take to keep our community safe.\u201d\nIn a briefing held late afternoon Wednesday, McMahill said the Cybertruck was rented in Colorado via peer-to-peer rental company Turo and driven to Las Vegas, arriving around 7:30 a.m. PT.\nMcMahill also noted that the Ford truck in the New Orleans attack was rented via Turo. He called it a \u201ccoincidence\u201d and said it was being investigated. Turo, which was founded in 2010 and has been compared to the Airbnb for cars, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup\u2019s website or app. The company, which filed for an IPO in 2022, was expected to go public this year.\nA Turo spokesperson told TechCrunch in an emailed statement the company is working with law enforcement.\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families. We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,\u201d the emailed statement said. \u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat. We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management, thanks to our world-class trust and safety technologies and teams that include experienced former law enforcement professionals.\u201d\nMcMahill said law enforcement was looking for secondary devices, adding there does not appear to be any further threat to the Las Vegas community. \u201cIf that changes, obviously you will hear directly from me to provide any update to you,\u201d he said.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk posted several notes on X, initially stating that the \u201cwhole senior Tesla team is investigating\u201d the incident. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything. We\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Musk wrote.\nMusk later posted that the vehicle was operating as normal, according to telemetry data he said the Tesla team viewed.\n\u201cWe have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,\u201d he wrote.\nMcMahill personally thanked Musk for providing law enforcement with specific information about the operation of the Cybertruck as well as video from Tesla charging stations used by the individual.\nThe incident comes as Musk, who also owns X, maintains a close connection to President-elect Donald Trump. A review of Musk\u2019s flight data showed at least 31 flights to or from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. This week, the NYT reported that Musk has been staying at a cottage on the Mar-a-Lago property.\nThis article has been updated with new information, including that the explosion left one person dead and several injured, what contents were found in the vehicle, and images.\n\ntitle3:\nApple offers holiday discount in China as Huawei competition heats up\ndescription3:\nPeople walk past an advertisement for the iPhone 16 Pro at an Apple store during National Day holiday on October 3, 2024 in Chongqing, China.\nApple is offering discounts on its top-end iPhones and other products in China for the upcoming Chinese New Year as the U.S. tech giant faces heightened competition in one of its most crucial markets.\nThe Cupertino giant is giving customers 500 Chinese yuan ($68.50) off of the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max, and 400 yuan off the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus. Offers also include discounts for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15.\nFor a long time Apple has resisted offering discounts through its own retail channels. Instead, third-party retailers would offer deals at certain times of the year. However, as competition ramps up, Apple has been more inclined in the last year to post seasonal deals.\nApple offered a similar Chinese New Year deal last year and in May, the company offered hefty discounts as part of China's 618 shopping festival.\n\ntitle4:\nChinese government hackers reportedly targeted US Treasury's sanctions office during December cyberattack\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nChinese government hackers targeted the U.S. Treasury\u2019s highly sensitive sanctions office during a December cyberattack, according to reports.\nAccording to The Washington Post, the state-sponsored hackers targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a government department that imposes economic and trade sanctions against countries and individuals, to potentially access information on Chinese organizations that the U.S. government may be considering designating for financial sanctions.\nThe China-backed hacking group, which compromised the U.S. Treasury in December to access employee workstations and unclassified documents, also breached the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Financial Research and the Office of the Treasury Secretary, according to the report.\nThe cyberattack, described as a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident\u201d by the Treasury, was discovered on December 8 when BeyondTrust, a third-party software provider of identity management tools, alerted the agency to a cybersecurity incident.\nThe U.S. Treasury did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\"\n\nResponse:",
