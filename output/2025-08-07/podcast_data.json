The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT \u2014 and its creator, OpenAI \u2014 pointing to OpenAI\u2019s broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are more like agents than chatbots.\nWhile GPT-4 enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users \u2014 such as generating software applications, navigating a user\u2019s calendar, or creating research briefs.\nWith GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that\u2019s responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to \u201cthink\u201d through answers.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nDuring a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is \u201cthe best model in the world,\u201d and said it represented a \u201csignificant step\u201d along the company\u2019s path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work \u2014 that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\u201cHaving something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,\u201d said Altman.\nStarting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI\u2019s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company\u2019s effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time. (Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.)\n\u201cThis is just one of the ways that I\u2019m excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,\u201d said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI\u2019s long-standing mission to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI\u2019s most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week \u2014 nearly 10% of the globe\u2019s population, according to the company.\nMany see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model\u2019s reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI\u2019s capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do.\nGPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition\nOpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas.\nThe company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what\u2019s become known as \u201cvibe coding.\u201d\nOn SWE-bench Verified \u2014 a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub \u2014 GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored 74.5%, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 59.6%.\nOn Humanity\u2019s Last Exam \u2014 a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences \u2014 a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That\u2019s slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 44.4% on the test.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nOn GPQA Diamond \u2014 a test of PhD-level science questions \u2014 GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%.\nOpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company\u2019s previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively.\nWhile AI chatbots are not medical professionals, millions of people are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results.\nIn addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, subjective domains, such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits \u201cbetter taste\u201d than other AI models on creative tasks.\n\u201cThe vibes of this model are really good,\u201d said Turley.\nGPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI\u2019s previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations \u2014 the tendency for AI models to make up information \u2014 compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be getting worse in OpenAI\u2019s latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn\u2019t quite understand why it was happening.\nIn responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That\u2019s a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test.\nOn a benchmark measuring an AI model\u2019s agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI\u2019s ability to navigate an airline\u2019s website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI\u2019s ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%.\nOpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to scheme against humans or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models.\nAlex Beutel, OpenAI\u2019s safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that\u2019s more \u201ctransparent and honest in ways users can trust.\u201d\nBeutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.\nUpgrades for consumers and developers\nChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT\u2019s setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT\u2019s responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI\u2019s Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week.\nFor developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI\u2019s API in three sizes \u2014 gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano \u2014 which will spend more or less time \u201creasoning\u201d through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model\u2019s responses should be.\nThe base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series) and $10 per million output tokens.\nThe launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, gpt-oss, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI\u2019s previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding.\nHowever, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla shuts down Dojo, the AI training supercomputer that Musk said would be key to full self-driving\ndescription1:\nTesla is breaking up the team behind its Dojo supercomputer, ending the automaker\u2019s play at developing in-house chips for driverless technology, according to Bloomberg.\nDojo\u2019s lead, Peter Bannon, is leaving the company, and the remaining team members will be reassigned to other data center and compute projects within Tesla, per Bloomberg\u2019s reporting, which cited anonymous sources.\nThe disbanding of Tesla\u2019s Dojo efforts follows the departure of around 20 workers, who left the automaker to start their own AI company called DensityAI. The new startup is reportedly coming out of stealth soon and is building chips, hardware, and software that will power data centers for AI that are used in robotics, by AI agents, and in automotive applications. DensityAI was founded by former Dojo head Ganesh Venkataramanan and ex-Tesla employees Bill Chang and Ben Floering.\nIt also comes at a crucial time for Tesla.\nCEO Elon Musk has pushed to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, despite a limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that featured Model Y vehicles with a human in the front passenger seat and resulted in a number of reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\nTesla\u2019s decision to shut down Dojo, which Musk has been talking about since 2019, is a major shift in strategy. Musk has said that Dojo would be the cornerstone of Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions and its goal to reach full self-driving due to its ability to \u201cprocess truly vast amounts of video data.\u201d He talked about Dojo, albeit briefly, as recently as the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call.\nIn 2023, Morgan Stanley predicted Dojo could add $500 billion to the company\u2019s market value by unlocking new revenue streams in the form of robotaxis and software services. Just last year, Musk noted that Tesla\u2019s AI team would \u201cdouble down\u201d on Dojo in the lead-up to Tesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal, which happened in October.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBut talk about Dojo halted around August 2024, when Musk began touting Cortex instead, Tesla\u2019s \u201cgiant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.\u201d\nThe Dojo project was one part supercomputer, one part in-house chip-making. Tesla unveiled its D1 chip when it formally announced Dojo at its first AI Day in 2021. Venkataramanan presented the chip, which Tesla said would be used alongside Nvidia\u2019s GPU to power the Dojo supercomputer. The automaker also said it was working on a next-gen D2 chip that would solve any information flow bottlenecks of its predecessor.\nSources told Bloomberg that now Tesla plans to increase its reliance on Nvidia, as well as other external tech partners like AMD for compute and Samsung for chip manufacturing. Tesla last month signed a $16.5 billion deal with Samsung to make its AI6 inference chips, a chip design that promises to scale from powering FSD and Tesla\u2019s Optimus humanoid robots all the way to high-performance AI training in data centers.\nDuring Tesla\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, Musk hinted at potential redundancies.\n\u201cThinking about Dojo 3 and the AI6 inference chip, it seems like intuitively, we want to try to find convergence there, where it\u2019s basically the same chip,\u201d Musk said.\nThe news comes as Tesla\u2019s board offers Musk a $29 billion pay package to keep him at Tesla and help push the company\u2019s AI efforts forward, rather than getting too sidetracked by his other companies, including the more pure-play AI startup xAI.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Tesla for more information.\nHave a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

That deal didn\u2019t happen, according to a source familiar with the matter. Instead, news broke in April that the startup planned to sell itself to OpenAI for roughly the same valuation: $3 billion.\nWhile that deal famously fell apart, one bigger question remains: If the startup was growing that fast and attracting VC interest, why would it sell at all?\nInsiders tell TechCrunch that for all the popularity and hype around AI coding assistants, they can actually be massively money-losing businesses. Vibe coders generally, and Windsurf in particular, can have such expensive structures that their gross margins are \u201cvery negative,\u201d one person close to Windsurf told TechCrunch. Meaning it cost more to run the product than the startup could charge for it.\nThis is due to the high costs of using large language models (LLMs), the person explained. AI coding assistants are particularly pressured to always offer the most recent, most advanced, and most expensive LLMs because model makers are particularly fine-tuning their latest models for improvements in coding and related tasks like debugging.\nThis is a challenge compounded by fierce competition in the vibe-coding and code-assist market. Rivals include companies that already have huge customer bases like Anysphere\u2019s Cursor and GitHub Copilot.\nThe most straightforward path to improving margins in this business involves the startups building their own models, thereby eliminating costs of paying suppliers like Anthropic and OpenAI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very expensive business to run if you\u2019re not going to be in the model game,\u201d said the person.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBut that idea comes with its own risks. Windsurf\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Varun Mohan, ultimately decided against the company building its own model \u2014 an expensive undertaking, the person said.\nIn addition, model makers are already competing directly. Anthropic offers Claude Code and OpenAI offers Codex, for instance.\nSelling the business was a strategic move to lock in a high return before it could be undermined by the very companies that supplied its AI, including OpenAI and Anthropic, which were also entering the AI coding market.\nMultiple people believe that the same pressure on margins Windsurf faced could be impacting Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, as well as vibe coders like Lovable, Replit, and others.\n\u201cMargins on all of the \u2018code gen\u2019 products are either neutral or negative. They\u2019re absolutely abysmal,\u201d said Nicholas Charriere, founder of Mocha, a vibe-coding startup and back-end hosting solution serving small and medium businesses (SMBs). He added that he believes the variable costs for all the startups in the sector are very close, likely within 10% to 15% of one another.\nUnlike Windsurf, Anysphere has been growing so fast that it intends to remain an independent company, having already turned down acquisition offers, including, reports say, from OpenAI.\nAnd Anysphere announced in January that it is attempting to build its own model, which could give it more control over its expenses. In July, the startup hired two leaders from Anthropic\u2019s Claude Code team, the Information reported, but two weeks later, these employees returned to work at Anthropic.\nIn addition to building a model, Anysphere could expect the cost of LLMs to decrease over time.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what everyone\u2019s banking on,\u201d said Erik Nordlander, a general partner at Google Ventures. \u201cThe inference cost today, that\u2019s the most expensive it\u2019s ever going to be.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how true that is. Rather than falling as expected, the cost of some of the latest AI models has risen, as they use more time and computational resources to handle complicated, multistep tasks.\nWhen that will change remains to be seen. On Thursday, for instance, OpenAI introduced a new flagship model, GPT-5, with fees that are significantly less than its competitor, Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1. And Anysphere immediately offered this model as a choice for Cursor users.\nAnysphere has also recently changed its pricing structure to pass along the increased costs of running Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude model, particularly to its most active users. The move caught some of Cursor customers by surprise, since they didn\u2019t expect additional charges on top of its $20-per-month Pro plan. Anysphere CEO Michael Truell later apologized for unclear communication about the pricing change in a blog post.\nThis is the rock and the hard place. Although Cursor is one of the most popular AI applications, having reached $500 million in ARR in June, the company\u2019s user base may not be so loyal to the product if another company develops a tool that is superior to Cursor, investors say.\nAnysphere didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nGiven the competitive landscape and the costs, Windsurf\u2019s decision to get out may prove to be understandable. After the OpenAI deal fell through, the founders and key employees left to join Google in a deal that led to a $2.4 billion payout to key shareholders. The remaining business then sold itself to Cognition.\nWhile many, including prominent VCs, criticized Mohan for leaving approximately 200 employees without roles at Google, a source familiar with the deal insisted the acquisition actually maximized the outcomes for all employees.\nBeyond Cursor, other AI coding tools are also among the fastest growing startups of the LLM generation, like Replit, Lovable, and Bolt, and all of them rely on model makers as well.\nAdditionally, if this extremely popular business sector, already generating hundreds of millions in revenue or more a year, has difficulty building on top of model makers, what might it mean for other, more nascent industries?\n\ntitle3:\nxAI's legal chief steps down after whirlwind year\ndescription3:\nRobert Keele said this week that he has stepped down as xAI\u2019s head of legal after just over a year, saying he wants to spend more time with his children. In his announcement, Keele also acknowledged \u201cdaylight between our worldviews\u201d with boss Elon Musk, who hasn\u2019t commented on Keele\u2019s exit.\n\u201cI love my two toddlers and I don\u2019t get to see them enough,\u201d Keele wrote, posting the news on both X and LinkedIn. Despite calling his time at the AI startup \u201cincredible\u201d and working with Musk \u201cthe adventure of a lifetime,\u201d he said he couldn\u2019t keep \u201criding two horses at once \u2014 the family and the job.\u201d\nKeele\u2019s news prompted an outpouring of support on social media from xAI colleagues as well as parents. When he joined xAI in May 2024 as its first legal head, he had just launched his own, very short-lived fractional legal outfit. \u201cKeele Law had a good run (~3 weeks!), but I couldn\u2019t pass up an opportunity to run legal at xAI,\u201d he wrote at the time, calling himself \u201cbeyond stoked, and insanely lucky.\u201d\nKeele arrived just before xAI announced a massive $6 billion Series B funding round in May 2024, backed by heavy hitters like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, valuing the company at $24 billion. Soon after, xAI began experiencing rapid growth and, in March of this year, acquired X, Musk\u2019s social media company, in a deal that, said Musk at the time, valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.\nBefore his entrepreneurial stint, Keele had been head of legal at autonomous aircraft maker Elroy Air and general counsel at Airbus\u2019s Silicon Valley innovation center.\nTaking over is Lily Lim, who, before becoming a lawyer, was a rocket scientist at NASA, working on spacecraft navigation for the project that mapped Venus\u2019s surface. She joined xAI in late 2024 as a privacy and IP specialist after legal stints at numerous firms and companies like ServiceNow.\nKeele\u2019s departure fits an ongoing pattern of executive turnover across Musk\u2019s empire. X CEO Linda Yaccarino left last month, and Tesla has lost several top executives recently. Musk \u2014 who also has numerous longstanding lieutenants \u2014 openly expects employees to work long hours, even if it means sleeping at the office, as happened when he acquired X, formerly Twitter.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
