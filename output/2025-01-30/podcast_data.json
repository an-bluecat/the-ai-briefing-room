Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday January 31), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple tops 1 billion subscriptions, nearly $100B in services revenue in 2024\ndescription0:\nApple\u2019s iPhone sales may be down, but the company\u2019s Services division, which includes the App Store, iCloud, Music, TV+, and other subscriptions, is still soaring.\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant reported Thursday its Services business had an all-time revenue high of $26.3 billion for the quarter ended December 28, up 14% year-over-year. Services generated nearly $100 billion in revenue over the past year, CEO Tim Cook said during Thursday\u2019s earnings call. In addition, Apple reported having more than 1 billion subscriptions across its services, including through third-party apps in the App Store.\nThe company said that customer engagement with its services, including both transacting and paid accounts, reached record highs. Paid accounts and subscriptions both grew by double digits year over year.\nApple pointed to expansions of specific offerings like Apple Arcade, which continues to add games and Fitness+, which adds new programs. It also noted Apple\u2019s Tap to Pay for iPhone, which is now live in 20 markets.\nRegulatory impact\nOn the topic of subscriptions, investors wanted to know how a new regulatory environment could potentially affect these numbers.\nWhile investors didn\u2019t outright ask about the Trump administration\u2019s impact on Apple revenue directly, one question focused on whether new regulatory changes could be beneficial. That is, would a \u201cmore balanced regulatory environment\u201d potentially reverse prior headwinds that Apple may now be absorbing in its results?\nApple\u2019s CFO, Kevan Parekh, skirted the question, reiterating instead the positive numbers for Services and adding that customer engagement was increasing across the customer base, all its services offerings, and geographic regions. CEO Tim Cook didn\u2019t respond to the question.\nFor years, Apple has defended itself over antitrust lawsuits and other governmental actions, both in the U.S. and abroad. The core debate has centered on how much of a percentage Apple is justified to take from the apps it hosts on its App Store and the transactions that flow through them.\nLast year, one key antitrust case finally came to an end when the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately declined to hear an appeal on the Epic-Apple decision, initially filed by the Fortnite game maker. That means the lower court\u2019s decision that the tech giant was not a monopolist still stands.\nHowever, that decision did mean Apple has to allow app makers to steer customers to the web from links inside their apps.\nThough the lawsuit was largely in Apple\u2019s favor, Epic won a similar case with Google. Given the partial victory, other developers may have been inspired to pursue their own legal actions against Apple or Google, hoping to continue carving away at Apple\u2019s chokehold on the app distribution market.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI said to be in talks to raise $40B at a $340B valuation\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI may have billions of dollars in the bank. But it\u2019s gearing up to raise billions more, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.\nPer The WSJ, OpenAI is in talks to secure up to $40 billion in a funding round that would value the startup at $340 billion. SoftBank would lead the round, pouring between $15 billion to $25 billion into the ChatGPT maker, according to The WSJ.\nShould OpenAI successfully close the round, it\u2019d be a remarkable feat for the startup, which was valued at $157 billion in October. The WSJ says that OpenAI would use the capital to fund its money-losing business operations and fulfill its commitment to Stargate, its ambitious project to build AI data centers across the U.S.\nIn 2024, OpenAI reportedly lost around $5 billion against revenues of $3.7 billion. The losses could mount. In conjunction with partners including SoftBank, OpenAI aims to contribute billions of dollars to Stargate to start.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle quietly announces its next flagship AI model\ndescription2:\nUpdate: Some users on social media report that the changelog has been updated to remove mention of Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental. The references have disappeared for this reporter as well. A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that an \u201cout-of-date release note\u201d was \u201cpublished in error.\u201d The original story follows:\nGoogle took the low-key route for the launch of its next-gen flagship AI model, Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental. Instead of a splashy announcement, the company revealed the model in a changelog for its Gemini chatbot app.\nThe launch of Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental \u2014 the successor to the Gemini 1.5 Pro model that Google launched last February \u2014 comes as the tech world remains fixated on Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. DeepSeek\u2019s latest models, which are openly available for companies to download and use, match or best many leading models from American tech giants and AI companies in terms of performance. That\u2019s led to a reckoning in Silicon Valley \u2014 and at the highest levels of the U.S. government.\nGemini 2.0 Pro Experimental, which is available to Gemini Advanced users beginning Thursday, is now the leading model in Google\u2019s Gemini AI family, the company said. It should provide \u201cbetter factuality\u201d and \u201cstronger performance\u201d for coding and mathematics-related tasks.\nA snippet of the Gemini app changelog released on Thursday. Image Credits:Google\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re tackling advanced coding challenges, like generating a specific program from scratch, or solving mathematical problems, like developing complex statistical models or quantum algorithms, 2.0 Pro Experimental will help you navigate even the most complex tasks with greater ease and accuracy,\u201d Google writes in the changelog.\nGemini Advanced is a part of the company\u2019s Google One AI Premium paid plan; it\u2019s also available through Google\u2019s Gemini for Google Workspace add-ons.\nGoogle notes that Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental is in \u201cearly preview,\u201d and can have \u201cunexpected behaviors\u201d \u2014 and may make mistakes. Also, unlike other Gemini models available in the Gemini app, Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental doesn\u2019t have access to real-time information and isn\u2019t compatible with some of the app\u2019s features.\n\u201cWe believe in rapid iteration and bringing the best of Gemini to the world, and we want to give Gemini Advanced subscribers priority access to our latest AI innovations,\u201d Google continued in the changelog. \u201cYour feedback helps us improve these models over time and learning from experimental launches informs how we release models more widely.\u201d\nCoinciding with the Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental release, Google has brought the Gemini 2.0 Flash model it announced in December to the Gemini app for all users. It\u2019ll remain the default Gemini app model for the foreseeable future.\n\ntitle3:\nIntel has already received $2.2B in federal grants for chip production\ndescription3:\nSemiconductor giant Intel Corporation has already received $2.2 billion in federal grants from the U.S. Department of Commerce through the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, the company shared during its Thursday earnings call.\nDave Zinsner, Intel\u2019s co-interim CEO, executive vice president, and CFO, said the Silicon Valley-based company received the first tranche of $1.1 billion in federal grants at the end of 2024 and an additional $1.1 billion in January 2025.\nThese grants are based on reaching certain milestones, Zinsner added. Another $5.66 billion has yet to be dispersed.\nThe company was awarded a total of $7.86 billion in federal grants to build semiconductors in the U.S. in November as part of the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. While a sizable sum, this total was less than the original $8.5 billion estimate.\nWhen Intel was awarded its grant money in November, the company said it was planning to put the funds toward manufacturing and advanced packaging, or toward techniques to assemble and integrate multiple semiconductor chips into one package. This will be carried out at Intel facilities across Arizona, New Mexico, Ohio, and Oregon.\nThe U.S. CHIPS and Science Act was signed into federal law by former president Joe Biden in 2022 in an effort to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The act set aside $52 billion in subsidies for domestic chip manufacturers.\nWhile already two years old, the CHIPS Act faces some uncertainty under the Trump administration. If President Donald Trump\u2019s federal funding freeze, which is currently being blocked by a federal judge, does go into effect, it would affect the Commerce Department employees focused on the CHIPS Act, according to Bloomberg reporting.\nZinsner had a rosier outlook, though. When asked by an analyst, he said that Intel has already been in communication with the Trump administration and \u201cfeels really good\u201d about the administration\u2019s outlook on bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.\n\u201cWe look forward to continued engagement with the Trump administration as we advance this work and support their efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,\u201d Zinsner said earlier on the call.\n\ntitle4:\nChina's DeepSeek has some big AI claims; not all experts are convinced\ndescription4:\nDado Ruvic | Reuters\nChinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek rocked markets this week with claims its new AI model outperforms OpenAI's and cost a fraction of the price to build. The assertions \u2014 specifically that DeepSeek's large language model cost just $5.6 million to train \u2014 have sparked concerns over the eyewatering sums that tech giants are currently spending on computing infrastructure required to train and run advanced AI workloads. Investor fears over DeepSeek's disruptive impact erased close to $600 billion from Nvidia's market capitalization Monday \u2014 the biggest single-day drop for any company in U.S. history. But not everyone is convinced by DeepSeek's claims. CNBC asked industry experts for their views on DeepSeek, and how it actually compares to OpenAI, creator of viral chatbot ChatGPT which sparked the AI revolution.\nWhat is DeepSeek?\nLast week, DeepSeek released R1, its new reasoning model that rivals OpenAI's o1. A reasoning model is a large language model that breaks prompts down into smaller pieces and considers multiple approaches before generating a response. It is designed to process complex problems in a similar way to humans. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of AI-focused quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, to focus on large language models and reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI. AGI as a concept loosely refers to the idea of an AI that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks.\nMuch of the technology behind R1 isn't new. What is notable, however, is that DeepSeek is the first to deploy it in a high-performing AI model with \u2014 according to the company \u2014 considerable reductions in power requirements. \"The takeaway is that there are many possibilities to develop this industry. The high-end chip/capital intensive way is one technological approach,\" said Xiaomeng Lu, director of Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice. \"But DeepSeek proves we are still in the nascent stage of AI development and the path established by OpenAI may not be the only route to highly capable AI.\"\nHow is it different from OpenAI?\nDeepSeek has two main systems that have garnered buzz from the AI community: V3, the large language model that unpins its products, and R1, its reasoning model. Both models are open-source, meaning their underlying code is free and publicly available for other developers to customize and redistribute. DeepSeek's models are much smaller than many other large language models. V3 has a total of 671 billion parameters, or variables that the model learns during training. And while OpenAI doesn't disclose parameters, experts estimate its latest model to have at least a trillion. In terms of performance, DeepSeek says its R1 model achieves performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 on reasoning tasks, citing benchmarks including AIME 2024, Codeforces, GPQA Diamond, MATH-500, MMLU and SWE-bench Verified.\nIn a technical report, the company said its V3 model had a training cost of only $5.6 million \u2014 a fraction of the billions of dollars that notable Western AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic have spent to train and run their foundational AI models. It isn't yet clear how much DeepSeek costs to run, however. If the training costs are accurate, though, it means the model was developed at a fraction of the cost of rival models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others. Daniel Newman, CEO of tech insight firm The Futurum Group, said these developments suggest \"a massive breakthrough,\" although he shed some doubt on the exact figures. \"I believe the breakthroughs of DeepSeek indicate a meaningful inflection for scaling laws and are a real necessity,\" he said. \"Having said that, there are still a lot of questions and uncertainties around the full picture of costs as it pertains to the development of DeepSeek.\" Meanwhile, Paul Triolio, senior VP for China and technology policy lead at advisory firm DGA Group, noted it was difficult to draw a direct comparison between DeepSeek's model cost and that of major U.S. developers. \"The 5.6 million figure for DeepSeek V3 was just for one training run, and the company stressed that this did not represent the overall cost of R&D to develop the model,\" he said. \"The overall cost then was likely significantly higher, but still lower than the amount spent by major US AI companies.\" DeepSeek wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nComparing DeepSeek, OpenAI on price\nDeepSeek and OpenAI both disclose pricing for their models' computations on their websites. DeepSeek says R1 costs 55 cents per 1 million tokens of inputs \u2014 \"tokens\" referring to each individual unit of text processed by the model \u2014 and $2.19 per 1 million tokens of output. In comparison, OpenAI's pricing page for o1 shows the firm charges $15 per 1 million input tokens and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For GPT-4o mini, OpenAI's smaller, low-cost language model, the firm charges 15 cents per 1 million input tokens.\nSkepticism over chips\nDeepSeek's reveal of R1 has already led to heated public debate over the veracity of its claim \u2014 not least because its models were built despite export controls from the U.S. restricting the use of advanced AI chips to China. DeepSeek claims it had its breakthrough using mature Nvidia clips, including H800 and A100 chips, which are less advanced than the chipmaker's cutting-edge H100s, which can't be exported to China. However, in comments to CNBC last week, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, said he believed DeepSeek used the banned chips \u2014 a claim that DeepSeek denies.\nwatch now\nNvidia has since come out and said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export-compliant.\nThe real deal or not?\nIndustry experts seem to broadly agree that what DeepSeek has achieved is impressive, although some have urged skepticism over some of the Chinese company's claims. \"DeepSeek is legitimately impressive, but the level of hysteria is an indictment of so many,\" U.S. entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who founded Oculus and Anduril wrote on X. \"The $5M number is bogus. It is pushed by a Chinese hedge fund to slow investment in American AI startups, service their own shorts against American titans like Nvidia, and hide sanction evasion.\" Seena Rejal, chief commercial officer of NetMind, a London-headquartered startup that offers access to DeepSeek's AI models via a distributed GPU network, said he saw no reason not to believe DeepSeek. \"Even if it's off by a certain factor, it still is coming in as greatly efficient,\" Rejal told CNBC in a phone interview earlier this week. \"The logic of what they've explained is very sensible.\" However, some have claimed DeepSeek's technology might not have been built from scratch. \"DeepSeek makes the same mistakes O1 makes, a strong indication the technology was ripped off,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla said on X, without giving more details. It's a claim that OpenAI itself has alluded to, telling CNBC in a statement Wednesday that it is reviewing reports DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used output data from its models to develop their AI model, a method referred to as \"distillation.\" \"We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC.\nCommoditization of AI\nHowever the scrutiny surrounding DeepSeek shakes out, AI scientists broadly agree it marks a positive step for the industry. Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta , said that DeepSeek's success represented a victory for open-source AI models, not necessarily a win for China over the U.S. Meta is behind a popular open-source AI model called Llama. \"To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think: 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong. The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones',\" he said in a post on LinkedIn. \"DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta). They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people's work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.\" WATCH: Why DeepSeek is putting America's AI lead in jeopardy\nwatch now\"\n\nResponse:",
