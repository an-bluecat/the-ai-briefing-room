Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Together, these cases are shaping up to be a win for the tech industry, which has spent years in legal battles with media companies arguing that training AI models on copyrighted works is fair use.\nHowever, these decisions aren\u2019t the sweeping wins some companies hoped for \u2014 both judges noted that their cases were limited in scope.\nJudge Chhabria made clear that this decision does not mean that all AI model training on copyrighted works is legal, but rather that the plaintiffs in this case \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and failed to develop sufficient evidence in support of the right ones.\n\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Judge Chhabria said in his decision. Later, he said, \u201cIn cases involving uses like Meta\u2019s, it seems like the plaintiffs will often win, at least where those cases have better-developed records on the market effects of the defendant\u2019s use.\u201d\nJudge Chhabria ruled that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted works in this case was transformative \u2014 meaning the company\u2019s AI models did not merely reproduce the authors\u2019 books.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nFurthermore, the plaintiffs failed to convince the judge that Meta\u2019s copying of the books harmed the market for those authors, which is a key factor in determining whether copyright law has been violated.\n\u201cThe plaintiffs presented no meaningful evidence on market dilution at all,\u201d said Judge Chhabria.\nBoth Anthropic\u2019s and Meta\u2019s wins involve training AI models on books, but there are several other active lawsuits against technology companies for training AI models on other copyrighted works. For instance, The New York Times is suing OpenAI and Microsoft for training AI models on news articles, while Disney and Universal are suing Midjourney for training AI models on films and TV shows.\nJudge Chhabria noted in his decision that fair use defenses depend heavily on the details of a case, and some industries may have stronger fair use arguments than others.\n\u201cIt seems that markets for certain types of works (like news articles) might be even more vulnerable to indirect competition from AI outputs,\u201d said Chhabria.\n\ntitle1:\nKalshi closes $185M round as rival Polymarket reportedly seeks $200M\ndescription1:\nKalshi just raised a $185 million round, led by crypto-focused VC firm Paradigm, bringing the company\u2019s valuation to $2 billion post-money, representatives from Paradigm and Kalshi confirmed to TechCrunch.\n\u201cPrediction markets remind me of crypto 15 years ago: a new asset class on a path to trillions,\u201d Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner at Paradigm, told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. \u201cThere\u2019s no better team than Kalshi to scale prediction markets and reshape how people think about everything from elections and economic markets to weather and sports.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal was first to report on the round.\nThis news comes one day after Bloomberg reported that Kalshi\u2019s biggest but regulatory-troubled rival Polymarket is raising $200 million at around a $1 billion pre-money valuation, led by Founders Fund. That deal is not yet final, sources said. Founders Fund declined to comment.\nPrediction markets use blockchain tech to allow users to place bets on the outcome of everything from pop culture events to political ones.\nDoing the math, the investors backing Kalshi are paying more of a premium than the ones backing Polymarket, should the latter deal close as reported.\nThere\u2019s a good reason for that. Polymarket has been banned from the U.S. since 2022 as part of an agreement with U.S. regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nAccording to Polymarket\u2019s terms of use, a number of other countries and provinces have banned or restricted Polymarket, too. These include the United Kingdom, France, Ontario, Singapore, Poland, Thailand, Belgium, and Taiwan. Regulators argue that these are either betting markets and should be licensed like gambling facilities or they are securities markets and should be regulated as such.\nKalshi, on the other hand, worked through a similar battle with the CFTC and came to an agreement to be regulated by the CFTC. U.S. residents may freely use the site.\nWhile a defiant, unregulated market may appeal to those who rail against such things, limited partner investors in venture funds also tend to prefer less risk.\nStill, if Founders Fund does write a big check, that could mean Polymarket is making headway in its hope to end the formal ban under a more crypto-friendly Trump administration. Elon Musk\u2019s X apparently isn\u2019t waiting for that. The two companies announced a partnership deal earlier this month to make Polymarket X\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d prediction market, though details of what exactly that entails were scant.\u200b\u200b\n\ntitle2:\nMeta is adding AI-powered summaries to WhatsApp\ndescription2:\nMeta announced on Wednesday that it\u2019s adding an AI-powered summaries feature to WhatsApp. The optional new feature uses Meta AI to summarize unread messages in a chat.\nThis summary would only be visible to you, not others in your chat, the company notes.\nThe feature builds on the AI technology that Meta released in April, which allowed the company to implement AI features that don\u2019t impact encryption or user privacy.\n\u201cMessage Summaries uses Private Processing technology, which allows Meta AI to generate a response without Meta or WhatsApp ever seeing your messages or the private summaries. No one else in the chat can see that you summarized unread messages either,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\nWhile the feature is turned off by default, WhatsApp shows a little icon to indicate that the feature is available for you.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta is initially rolling out the feature in the U.S. with English language support. It will reach more countries and languages later this year.\nUntil now, users could access Meta AI within the chat to ask general questions or tag a message to give the chatbot context. However, Meta AI couldn\u2019t read your messages.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster. Connect deeper.

This allows it to summarize messages or provide writing suggestions.\nThe new AI-powered features are available under a new setting that can be accessed via Settings > Chats > Private Processing, which lets you turn on or off individual functions.\n\ntitle3:\nRubrik acquires Predibase to accelerate adoption of AI agents\ndescription3:\nData cybersecurity company Rubrik announced Wednesday its intent to acquire Predibase. Predibase is a venture-backed startup that helps companies train and fine-tune open source AI models to customize them to their needs. Rubrik is the latest company to make an acquisition with the goal of boosting enterprise AI agent adoption.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, though CNBC reported that the deal was between $100 million and $500 million, a sizable range. Rubrik declined to comment on the deal size.\nPredibase was founded in 2021 by Devvret Rishi, current CEO; Piero Molino, current chief science officer; and Travis Addair, current CTO. The company has raised more than $28 million in VC money from investors, including Felicis, Greylock, and Sancus Ventures, among others.\nThe integration of Predibase will allow Rubrik users to accelerate building AI agents through Amazon Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, and Google Agentspace, according to a press release.\n\u201cWhen [Predibase\u2019s] capabilities are paired with secure data platforms like Rubrik\u2019s, they can be transformative, helping ensure trusted data powers responsible and impactful AI,\u201d Bipul Sinha, co-founder and CEO of Rubrik, wrote in a blog post about the deal. \u201cJust as Rubrik has simplified access to secured, governed data for AI, Predibase is solving the performance and cost issues around deploying large language models for agentic and other AI applications.\u201d\nRubrik is just one in a growing list of companies making acquisitions to bolster their technology stack for the creation of AI agents.\nSalesforce acquired data management firm Informatica for $8 billion in May. Snowflake acquired Crunchy Data to bolster its AI agent offerings in early June, and Collibra acquired Raito for similar reasons a few days later.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Hundreds of people filled steep theater-style seating on Tuesday night to watch Kevin Roose, a columnist with The New York Times, and Platformer\u2019s Casey Newton record a live episode of their popular technology podcast, Hard Fork.\nAltman and Lightcap were the main event, but they\u2019d walked out too early. Roose explained that he and Newton were planning to \u2014 ideally, before OpenAI\u2019s executives were supposed to come out \u2014 list off several headlines that had been written about OpenAI in the weeks leading up to the event.\n\u201cThis is more fun that we\u2019re out here for this,\u201d said Altman. Seconds later, the OpenAI CEO asked, \u201cAre you going to talk about where you sue us because you don\u2019t like user privacy?\u201d\nWithin minutes of the program starting, Altman hijacked the conversation to talk about The New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI and its largest investor, Microsoft, in which the publisher alleges that Altman\u2019s company improperly used its articles to train large language models. Altman was particularly peeved about a recent development in the lawsuit, in which lawyers representing The New York Times asked OpenAI to retain consumer ChatGPT and API customer data.\n\u201cThe New York Times, one of the great institutions, truly, for a long time, is taking a position that we should have to preserve our users\u2019 logs even if they\u2019re chatting in private mode, even if they\u2019ve asked us to delete them,\u201d said Altman. \u201cStill love The New York Times, but that one we feel strongly about.\u201d\nFor a few minutes, OpenAI\u2019s CEO pressed the podcasters to share their personal opinions about the New York Times lawsuit \u2014 they demurred, noting that as journalists whose work appears in The New York Times, they are not involved in the lawsuit.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nAltman and Lightcap\u2019s brash entrance lasted only a few minutes, and the rest of the interview proceeded, seemingly, as planned. However, the flare-up felt indicative of the inflection point Silicon Valley seems to be approaching in its relationship with the media industry.\nIn the last several years, multiple publishers have brought lawsuits against OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta for training their AI models on copyrighted works. At a high level, these lawsuits argue that AI models have the potential to devalue, and even replace, the copyrighted works produced by media institutions.\nBut the tides may be turning in favor of the tech companies. Earlier this week, OpenAI competitor Anthropic received a major win in its legal battle against publishers. A federal judge ruled that Anthropic\u2019s use of books to train its AI models was legal in some circumstances, which could have broad implications for other publishers\u2019 lawsuits against OpenAI, Google, and Meta.\nPerhaps Altman and Lightcap felt emboldened by the industry win heading into their live interview with The New York Times journalists. But these days, OpenAI is fending off threats from every direction, and that became clear throughout the night.\nMark Zuckerberg has recently been trying to recruit OpenAI\u2019s top talent by offering them $100 million compensation packages to join Meta\u2019s AI superintelligence lab, Altman revealed weeks ago on his brother\u2019s podcast.\nWhen asked whether the Meta CEO really believes in superintelligent AI systems, or if it\u2019s just a recruiting strategy, Lightcap quipped: \u201cI think [Zuckerberg] believes he is superintelligent.\u201d\nLater, Roose asked Altman about OpenAI\u2019s relationship with Microsoft, which has reportedly been pushed to a boiling point in recent months as the partners negotiate a new contract. While Microsoft was once a major accelerant to OpenAI, the two are now competing in enterprise software and other domains.\n\u201cIn any deep partnership, there are points of tension and we certainly have those,\u201d said Altman. \u201cWe\u2019re both ambitious companies, so we do find some flashpoints, but I would expect that it is something that we find deep value in for both sides for a very long time to come.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s leadership today seems to spend a lot of time swatting down competitors and lawsuits. That may get in the way of OpenAI\u2019s ability to solve broader issues around AI, such as how to safely deploy highly intelligent AI systems at scale.\nAt one point, Newton asked OpenAI\u2019s leaders how they were thinking about recent stories of mentally unstable people using ChatGPT to traverse dangerous rabbit holes, including to discuss conspiracy theories or suicide with the chatbot.\nAltman said OpenAI takes many steps to prevent these conversations, such as by cutting them off early, or directing users to professional services where they can get help.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to slide into the mistakes that I think the previous generation of tech companies made by not reacting quickly enough,\u201d said Altman. To a follow-up question, the OpenAI CEO added, \u201cHowever, to users that are in a fragile enough mental place, that are on the edge of a psychotic break, we haven\u2019t yet figured out how a warning gets through.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
