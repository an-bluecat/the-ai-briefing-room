    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday January 27), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAI companies upped their federal lobbying spend in 2024 amid regulatory uncertainty\ndescription0:\nCompanies spent significantly more lobbying AI issues at the U.S. federal level last year compared to 2023 amid regulatory uncertainty.\nAccording to data compiled by OpenSecrets, 648 companies spent on AI lobbying in 2024 versus 458 in 2023, representing a 141% year-over-year increase.\nCompanies like Microsoft supported legislation such as the CREATE AI Act, which would support the benchmarking of AI systems developed in the U.S. Others, including OpenAI, put their weight behind the Advancement and Reliability Act, which would set up a dedicated government center for AI research.\nMost AI labs \u2014 that is, companies dedicated almost exclusively to commercializing various kinds of AI tech \u2014 spent more backing legislative agenda items in 2024 than in 2023, the data shows.\nOpenAI upped its lobbying expenditures to $1.76 million last year from $260,000 in 2023. Anthropic, OpenAI\u2019s close rival, more than doubled its spend from $280,000 in 2023 to $720,000 last year, and enterprise-focused startup Cohere boosted its spending to $230,000 in 2024 from just $70,000 two years ago.\nBoth OpenAI and Anthropic made hires over the last year to coordinate their policymaker outreach. Anthropic brought on its first in-house lobbyist, Department of Justice alum Rachel Appleton, and OpenAI hired political veteran Chris Lehane as its new VP of policy.\nAll told, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere set aside $2.71 million combined for their 2024 federal lobbying initiatives. That\u2019s a tiny figure compared to what the larger tech industry put toward lobbying in the same timeframe ($61.5 million), but more than four times the total that the three AI labs spent in 2023 ($610,000).\nTechCrunch reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere for comment but did not hear back as of press time.\nLast year was a tumultuous one in domestic AI policymaking. In the first half alone, Congressional lawmakers considered more than 90 AI-related pieces of legislation, according to the Brennan Center. At the state level, over 700 laws were proposed.\nCongress made little headway, prompting state lawmakers to forge ahead. Tennessee became the first state to protect voice artists from unauthorized AI cloning. Colorado adopted a tiered, risk-based approach to AI policy. And California governor Gavin Newsom signed dozens of AI-related safety bills, a few of which require AI companies to disclose details about their training.\nHowever, no state officials were successful in enacting AI regulation as comprehensive as international frameworks like the EU\u2019s AI Act.\nAfter a protracted battle with special interests, Governor Newsom vetoed bill SB 1047, which would have imposed wide-ranging safety and transparency requirements on AI developers. Texas\u2019 TRAIGA (Texas Responsible AI Governance Act) bill, which is even broader in scope, may suffer the same fate once it makes its way through the statehouse.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the federal government can make more progress on AI legislation this year versus last, or even whether there\u2019s a strong appetite for codification. President Donald Trump has signaled his intention to largely deregulate the industry, clearing what he perceives to be roadblocks to U.S. dominance in AI.\nDuring his first day in office, Trump revoked an executive order by former president Joe Biden that sought to reduce risks AI might pose to consumers, workers, and national security. On Thursday, Trump signed an EO instructing federal agencies to suspend certain Biden-era AI policies and programs, potentially including export rules on AI models.\nIn November, Anthropic called for \u201ctargeted\u201d federal AI regulation within the next 18 months, warning that the window for \u201cproactive risk prevention is closing fast.\u201d For its part, OpenAI in a recent policy doc called on the U.S. government to take more substantive action on AI and infrastructure to support the technology\u2019s development.\n\ntitle1:\nRetro Biosciences, backed by Sam Altman, is raising $1 billion to extend human lifespan\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman is doubling down on Retro Biosciences, a biotech startup based in San Francisco that wants humans to live 10 years longer than what it calls a healthy human lifespan.\nAltman previously provided Retro Biosciences\u2019 entire seed round of $180 million. Now, the startup is raising a $1 billion Series A that Altman is joining, the Financial Times reports.\nRetro Biosciences, which says it plans to launch trials for drugs targeting diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, recently trained a model with OpenAI to turn regular cells into stem cells.\nCEO Joe Betts-LaCroix told the FT he wants to move fast by discovering and developing a drug \u201cin the 2020s.\u201d\nThe startup joins other major billionaire-backed longevity efforts, including Altos Labs, which launched with $3 billion in 2022 backed by Jeff Bezos, and Unity Biotechnology, supported by both Bezos and Peter Thiel.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta to begin testing ads on Threads, its microblogging app\ndescription2:\nMeta will begin testing ads on its Threads microblogging service with a few companies in the U.S. and Japan, the company said in a blog post Friday.\nThe experiment marks Meta's first run at generating revenue from Threads. Meta launched the app in July 2023 to rival X, formerly known as Twitter, which Elon Musk purchased for $44 billion in late 2022.\n\"We'll closely monitoring this test before scaling it more broadly, with the goal of getting ads on Threads to a place where they are as interesting as organic content,\" Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram and the Meta executive who oversees Threads, said in a post on the service.\nDuring the test, a small number of Threads users will see ads with large images within their feeds. The test ads will resemble sponsored content that users of Facebook and Instagram typically see on those services, the blog post said.\nBusinesses participating in the test will also be able to access a brand-safety tool used in Meta's Facebook, Instagram and Reels products that is designed so that brands' sponsored content does not run alongside offensive content.\nMeta's existing \"monetization policies\" will apply to Threads, ensuring \"content that violates our Community Standards isn't eligible for ad adjacency,\" the company said.\nThreads has more than 300 million monthly users and three out of four people on Threads follow at least one business on their personal feeds, the company said in the blog post.\n\ntitle3:\nZuckerberg sets Meta's AI targets for the year, expects to spend $60 billion on growth\ndescription3:\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg looks on before the luncheon on the inauguration day of U.S. President Donald Trump's second Presidential term in Washington, U.S., Jan. 20, 2025.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Friday announced the company plans to invest around $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it continues to build out its artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nZuckerberg said 2025 will be \"a defining year for AI\" and that Meta is building a large datacenter that \"would cover a significant part of Manhattan\" to power its AI offerings. Additionally, Meta will bring on around 1 gigawatt in compute and end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, he said.\n\"This is a massive effort, and over the coming years it will drive our core products and business, unlock historic innovation, and extend American technology leadership,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a post on Facebook.\nMeta shares closed at $647.49 on Friday, a new all-time high after the announcement.\nThe company has been pouring billions of dollars into AI and ramping up related research and development in recent years, but it's a fiercely competitive market and will take time before investors begin to reap those benefits. In an April call with investors, Zuckerberg said he expects to see a \"multiyear investment cycle\" before Meta's AI products will scale into profitable services, but he also noted that the company has a \"strong track record\" in that department.\nShares of Meta plunged 16% at the time. The company still generates the vast majority of its revenue from digital advertising.\nZuckerberg said Friday that he expects the company's Meta AI digital assistant to become the \"leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people.\" Meta is also building an AI engineer that will contribute \"increasing amounts of code to our R&D efforts,\" Zuckerberg added.\n\"We have the capital to continue investing in the years ahead,\" he wrote in his Facebook post.\n\ntitle4:\nHow China\u2019s new AI model DeepSeek is threatening U.S. dominance\ndescription4:\nA little-known AI lab out of China has ignited panic throughout Silicon Valley after releasing AI models that can outperform America's best despite being built more cheaply and with less-powerful chips.\nDeepSeek, as the lab is called, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\nThe new developments have raised alarms on whether America's global lead in artificial intelligence is shrinking and called into question big tech's massive spend on building AI models and data centers.\nIn a set of third-party benchmark tests, DeepSeek's model outperformed Meta 's Llama 3.1, OpenAI's GPT-4o and Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding.\nDeepSeek on Monday released r1, a reasoning model that also outperformed OpenAI's latest o1 in many of those third-party tests.\n\"To see the DeepSeek new model, it's super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday. \"We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.\"\nDeepSeek also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China, cutting the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia's H100s. The latest advancements suggest DeepSeek either found a way to work around the rules, or that the export controls were not the chokehold Washington intended.\n\"They can take a really good, big model and use a process called distillation,\" said Benchmark General Partner Chetan Puttagunta. \"Basically you use a very large model to help your small model get smart at the thing you want it to get smart at. That's actually very cost-efficient.\"\nLittle is known about the lab and its founder, Liang WenFeng. DeepSeek was was born of a Chinese hedge fund called High-Flyer Quant that manages about $8 billion in assets, according to media reports.\nBut DeepSeek isn't the only Chinese company making inroads.\nLeading AI researcher Kai-Fu Lee has said his startup 01.ai was trained using only $3 million. TikTok parent company ByteDance on Wednesday released an update to its model that claims to outperform OpenAI's o1 in a key benchmark test.\n\"Necessity is the mother of invention,\" said Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas. \"Because they had to figure out work-arounds, they actually ended up building something a lot more efficient.\"\nWatch this video to learn more.\"\n\nResponse:",
