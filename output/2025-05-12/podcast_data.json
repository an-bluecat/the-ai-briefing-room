Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday May 13), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft Build 2025: What to expect, from Azure to Copilot upgrades\ndescription0:\nMicrosoft is hosting its annual Build developer conference next week from May 19 to 22. The event is guaranteed to include announcements regarding new AI integrations, services, and apps, including for Windows.\nAt last year\u2019s Build, Microsoft announced an integration of Copilot into Microsoft Teams, Copilot+ AI-powered PCs, Windows Volumetric Apps for Meta Quest headsets, and more.\nThe keynotes will be streamed online for free. As for what to expect, there is good reason to believe Microsoft will announce deeper integrations for its Copilot generative AI with many of its software offerings, both on the consumer and enterprise sides.\nThe company last November raised prices for many of its software products, including Windows 365, Office 365, and Microsoft 365, among many others, by 5%. To justify these increases, the company could introduce new AI-powered features and capabilities.\nCopilot is likely to be a headliner at Build, and big changes to it could be on the way. Microsoft is reportedly testing alternative AI models from xAI, Meta, Anthropic, and DeepSeek as possible replacements for OpenAI technology in Copilot as the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI becomes strained.\nOn Windows, Copilot could gain \u201cagentic\u201d functionality that allows the tech to perform basic PC tasks autonomously. Well-known leaker TestingCatalog found references to an Action button in the Copilot client for Windows that, when selected, can kick off certain \u201ceveryday tasks.\u201d\nMicrosoft is also said to have developed a family of models called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI\u2019s own, which the tech giant is considering offering through an API. Build may well end up being the venue where Microsoft decides to unveil these.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Rumors of a \u201cMaia 2\u201d bubbled up on social media last week; chipmaker Marvell is contracted to manufacture it, according to semiconductor analyst Ray Wang.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle I/O 2025: How to watch all the AI and Android reveals\ndescription1:\nGoogle is gearing up to hold its largest developer conference of the year, Google I/O 2025, on May 20 and May 21. CEO Sundar Pichai, DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis, and executives in charge of Search, Cloud, and Android will announce major updates to Google\u2019s product offerings.\nWe\u2019re expecting Google I/O 2025 to focus on AI a lot (seriously, a lot).\nGoogle\u2019s family of AI models, Gemini, will likely take center stage during Google I/O 2025 as Pichai and Hassabis continue their push for dominance over OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other well-funded competitors. We\u2019re also expecting updates around DeepMind\u2019s projects, such as its multimodal AI system Project Astra. At last year\u2019s Google I/O, the company teased a pair of smart glasses powered by Project Astra.\nA key theme at Google I/O 2025 will be how AI is infiltrating all of Google\u2019s products. For example, Google\u2019s head of Search, Elizabeth Reid, is giving a talk on the AI stage about how generative AI is \u201crevolutionizing search.\u201d Other Google executives are scheduled to speak at the event about how scientists are using AI, how AI agents will use apps for users, and how Waymo\u2019s autonomous vehicles use AI to navigate the physical world.\nThe Google I/O 2025 keynote kicks off at 10 a.m. PT on May 20 from the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. You can watch a livestream of Google\u2019s keynote here, or watch via the embed below. At 1:30 p.m. PT, the developer keynote begins. As the name suggests, the developer keynote will focus less on the consumer side of things.\nLater in the day, at 3:30 p.m. PT, Hassabis will speak with Alex Kantrowitz, host of the Big Technology Podcast, about the future of DeepMind\u2019s AI and its impact on the world. At the same time, there will be livestreamed talks about the latest updates to Android, Chrome, and Google Cloud.\nSome of the talks at Google I/O won\u2019t be livestreamed, but lucky for you, TechCrunch will be on the ground covering the biggest announcements from the event.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Big U.S. tech firms that rely on China for sourcing and manufacturing, including Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia, AMD, and Meta, were all up 5% to 6% pre-market. Nasdaq Futures rose around 3.8%.\nNotably, the deal does not address the U.S.\u2019 recent removal of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, which waived duties on imports valued below $800.\n\ntitle3:\nTesla's robotaxi plans have the attention of federal investigators\ndescription3:\nFederal safety investigators have sent Tesla a detailed list of questions on its upcoming robotaxi service as part of an investigation into how the company\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d software operates in low-visibility conditions.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation wants the additional information about Full Self-Driving (Supervised) \u2014 or \u201cFSD\u201d \u2014 in order to \u201cunderstand how Tesla plans to evaluate its vehicles and driving automation technologies for use on public roads,\u201d according to the letter published Monday and first reported by Reuters.\nTesla hasn\u2019t been quiet about plans to launch a paid ride-hailing robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, using its own fleet vehicles this coming June. But it appears that Tesla\u2019s April 23 post on X captured the attention of federal regulators.\nThat post, which is cited in the letter, read: \u201cFSD Supervised ride-hailing service is live for an early set of employees in Austin & San Francisco Bay Area. We\u2019ve completed over 1.5k trips & 15k miles of driving. This service helps us develop & validate FSD networks, the mobile app, vehicle allocation, mission control & remote assistance operations.\u201d\nNHTSA opened its investigation into Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d software in October after four reported crashes in low-visibility situations. Tesla\u2019s FSD software is an advanced driver-assistance system that requires the driver to keep their hands on the wheel even as it handles some of the driving operations like braking and steering in certain environments and conditions.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has said the robotaxis will use the yet-to-be-released \u201cunsupervised\u201d version of its Full Self-Driving software.\nIn its May letter, the agency sent Tesla a series of questions squarely aimed at determining whether the automated driving system in its planned robotaxis is the same \u2014 or similar \u2014 to FSD Supervised. The agency asked for specifics on the fleet size and which vehicle models will be used in the robotaxi service, how Tesla plans to determine whether its robotaxi system is safe and if the automated driving system has any relationship to its FSD Supervised product.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Omar Sanseviero, a developer relations engineer at Google DeepMind, announced the figure on X over the weekend, also revealing that developers have created more than 70,000 variants of Gemma on the AI dev platform Hugging Face.\nGemma just passed 150 million downloads and over 70k variants on Hugging Face\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\nWhat would you like to see in the next Gemma versions? \u2014 Omar Sanseviero (@osanseviero) May 11, 2025\nGoogle launched Gemma in February 2024, aiming to compete with other \u201copen\u201d model families like Meta\u2019s Llama. The latest Gemma releases are multimodal, meaning that they can work with images as well as text, and support over 100 languages. Google has also created versions of Gemma fine-tuned for particular applications, like drug discovery.\nWhile 140 million downloads in roughly a year is a head-turning metric, Gemma trails far behind Llama, perhaps its chief rival, which surpassed 1.2 billion downloads in late April.\nWorth noting is that Gemma, as well as Llama, has been criticized for custom, non-standard licensing terms, which some devs say have made using the models commercially a risky proposition.\"\n\nResponse:",
