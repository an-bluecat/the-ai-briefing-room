This implies that Apple sold 2 billion between 2016 and now \u2014 also a nine-year period \u2014 marking the product\u2019s growing popularity.\nWhile Apple celebrates 3 billion iPhones sold, the company has struggled a bit in the stock market this year, as the tech giant fell behind Nvidia and Microsoft as the market\u2019s most highly valued businesses. So perhaps a bigger cause for celebration at Apple is that its iPhone sales were stronger this quarter than expected.\nSales of the iPhone, Apple\u2019s most popular product, are up 13% year-over-year, generating $44.6 billion in revenue, according to information shared on the earnings call. That\u2019s nearly half of the entire company\u2019s total revenue this quarter, which reached $94 billion.\nThis uptick in iPhone sales might be temporary, though. Apple expert and Bloomberg managing editor Mark Gurman mused that the company may have sold more iPhones last quarter over fears that President Trump\u2019s tariff plans would exponentially increase prices in the United States.\n\ntitle1:\nApple plans to 'significantly' grow AI investments, Cook says\ndescription1:\nApple on Thursday signaled that it\u2019s getting more serious about its plans to catch up in the AI race.\n\u201cWe see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. We are embedding it across our devices and platforms and across the company. We are also significantly growing our investments,\u201d CEO Tim Cook said on the Q3 2025 earnings call with investors. \u201cApple has always been about taking the most advanced technologies and making them easy to use and accessible for everyone, and that\u2019s at the heart of our AI strategy,\u201d he added.\nCook expanded on those comments on the call, noting that Apple was \u201creallocating a fair number of people\u201d to focus on AI.\n\u201cWe have a great, great team and we\u2019re putting all of our energy behind it,\u201d he added.\nAI investments are also driving increased CapEx spending, which was up year-to-date, the company said. However, Apple pointed out that it still employed a hybrid model where it relies on third parties to make capital investments, which is why the figure won\u2019t grow exponentially.\nAhead of its call, the company shared in an interview with CNBC that it\u2019s open to M&A to accelerate its roadmap. The company told the outlet that it has already acquired seven companies this year. None was \u201chuge\u201d in terms of dollar amount, Cook said.\nOn the call, he added that Apple was making acquisitions at the rate of one every several weeks.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nApple has been criticized for having been caught off guard by the AI era; it has announced a number of AI features that it has, so far, failed to ship. The company was even accused of showing off an improved AI-powered version of Siri that wasn\u2019t close to being ready to launch.\nBut Apple has defended itself by saying that it doesn\u2019t need to rush \u2014 that launching the wrong features or the wrong products just to be first would be a mistake. That\u2019s especially true if those products don\u2019t work as promised.\nSo far, Apple says it has launched more than 20 Apple Intelligence features, including visual intelligence, cleanup, and writing tools.\nLater this year, Apple plans to launch AI features like live translation and an AI-powered workout buddy, but the more personalized Siri\u2019s improvements have been delayed to 2026. On the call with investors, Cook said the company was \u201cmaking good progress\u201d on the Siri update.\nHe also shared his thoughts on how AI may impact the iPhone business if new hardware were to emerge. For instance, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg earlier this week suggested that AI glasses would be the form factor for interacting with the new technology, and those without them would be left behind.\nCook, naturally, disagreed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to see a world where iPhone\u2019s not living in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we are not thinking about other things, as well, but I think that the [AI] devices are likely to be complementary devices, not substitutions.\u201d\nThe exec declined to answer a question about which AI technologies it believed would ultimately be commoditized, saying that would give away part of its strategy.\nApple delivered better-than-expected iPhone sales and record revenue in Q3, which saw its stock pop in after-hours trading.\nThis article was updated after initial publication with more details from the earnings call.\n\ntitle2:\nReddit revenue soars as it bets on AI and advertising\ndescription2:\nReddit reported its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, and it\u2019s clear that the company\u2019s focus on AI has ramped up considerably.\nOne significant area of investment is growing its advertising business, supported by its AI-powered marketing tools. The results revealed that the majority of Reddit\u2019s revenue continues to come from ads, which brought in $465 million, representing 93% of the company\u2019s total revenue.\nLast month, Reddit launched two new features for advertisers: Reddit Insights, a tool that leverages the billions of posts and comments on the platform to spot trends and offer real-time insights for campaign strategies, and Conversation Summary Add-ons, which let advertisers include Reddit user discussions directly in ads, showing public opinions about products or brands.\nThe company also saw growth in its \u201cother revenue\u201d category, which includes its data licensing business \u2014 meaning its deals with AI providers for access to its data. Reddit said the category jumped 24% year-over-year to $35 million, up from $28.1 million in the same period a year prior.\nReddit has already established content licensing agreements with major players in AI, including Google and OpenAI. Although these deals are still new, the results from the second quarter point out a steady income stream that has significant potential for the long haul.\nAnother key AI-powered feature is the Reddit Answers tool, which launched in December. This tool, which offers answers in a conversational interface, has attracted 6 million weekly users, a considerable jump from 1 million users in the previous quarter.\nIn a letter to shareholders, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the platform is working to integrate the tool \u201cmore deeply into the core search experience\u201d to make \u201csearch a central feature across Reddit.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon CEO wants to put ads in your Alexa+ conversations\ndescription3:\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy sees an opportunity to deliver ads to users during their conversations with the company\u2019s AI-powered digital assistant, Alexa+, he said during Amazon\u2019s second-quarter earnings call Thursday.\n\u201cPeople are excited about the devices that they can buy from us that has Alexa+ enabled in it. People do a lot of shopping [with Alexa+]; it\u2019s a delightful shopping experience that will keep getting better,\u201d said Jassy on the call with investors and Wall Street analysts. \u201cI think over time, there will be opportunities, as people are engaging in more multi-turn conversations, to have advertising play a role to help people find discovery, and also as a lever to drive revenue.\u201d\nAmazon says it has rolled out Alexa+ to millions of customers, part of an effort to make its legacy digital assistant capable of agentic behaviors and more natural to talk to. Alexa+ is Amazon\u2019s answer to generative AI voice assistants from OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity that have made legacy systems feel outdated. However, the business models behind generative AI products remain unclear.\nAmazon has made Alexa+ free for Prime customers (who pay $14.99 a month) and added a $20-a-month subscription tier for Alexa+ on its own. Jassy suggested on Thursday that Alexa+ could eventually include subscription tiers beyond what\u2019s available today \u2014 perhaps an ad-free tier.\nUp until now, ads have only appeared in Alexa in limited ways. Users may occasionally see a visual ad on Amazon\u2019s smart display device, the Echo Show, or hear a pre-recorded ad in between songs on one of Alexa\u2019s smart speakers.\nBut Jassy\u2019s description of an AI-generated ad that Alexa+ delivers in a multistep conversation, which could help users find new products, is uncharted territory for Amazon and the broader tech industry. Marketers have expressed interest in advertising in AI chatbots, and specifically Alexa+, but exactly how remains unclear.\nAmazon\u2019s competitors in the AI space seem to think advertising is a promising business model for generative AI, too. Google is exploring how to infuse ads into its AI-powered search experience, AI mode. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he\u2019s open to a \u201ctasteful\u201d form of advertising in ChatGPT.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAmazon is spending a fortune to catch up in the AI race. In the second quarter of 2025, Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures rose to $31.4 billion, up 90% from the same period last year. A large part of that increased spending is to develop Amazon\u2019s in-house AI chips and build out data centers to support AI models. While the revenue of Amazon\u2019s cloud business, AWS, grew 18% in the second quarter, the company likely needs to generate new business to pay for these investments.\nJassy is betting that users will talk to Alexa+ more than Alexa, which could drive more advertising and more shopping on Amazon.com. However, early reviews of Alexa+ have been mixed. Amazon has reportedly struggled to ship some of Alexa+\u2019s more complicated features, and the rollout has been slower than many expected.\nThere\u2019s a lot to figure out before Amazon puts ads in Alexa+. Like most AI models, Alexa+ is not immune to hallucinations. Before advertisers agree to make Alexa+ a spokesperson for their products, Amazon may have to come up with some ways to ensure that its AI will not offer false advertising for a product.\nJassy seems enthusiastic about making advertising a larger part of Amazon business. Amazon\u2019s advertising revenue went up 22% in the second quarter, compared to the same period last year.\nDelivering ads in AI chatbot conversations may also raise privacy concerns. People tend to talk more with AI chatbots compared to deterministic assistants, like the traditional Alexa and Siri products. As a result, generative AI chatbots tend to collect more information on users. Some users might be unsettled by having that information sold to advertisers and having ads appear in their natural language conversations with AI.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle loses appeal over app store overhaul in Epic Games case\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nGoogle lost its appeal of a judge\u2019s court order requiring the tech giant to revamp its app store in an antitrust case filed by Fortnite maker Epic Games, Reuters reported on Thursday.\nThe 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Google\u2019s argument that the trial judge made legal errors in the antitrust case that unfairly favored Epic Games.\nEpic Games first filed its lawsuit in 2020 and was able to convince a jury in 2023 that Google illegally stifled competition. The trial judge ordered Google last October to open its app store to rivals and give Android users more choice when it comes to downloading apps. The order was on hold pending the outcome of Google\u2019s appeal.\nGoogle argued to the appeals court that its Play Store competes with Apple\u2019s App Store, and claimed that the trial judge unfairly prevented it from presenting that argument in defense against Epic\u2019s antitrust claims.\"\n\nResponse:",
