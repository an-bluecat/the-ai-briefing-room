Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday March 26), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft adds AI-powered deep research tools to Copilot\ndescription0:\nMicrosoft is introducing a \u201cdeep research\u201d AI-powered tool in Microsoft 365 Copilot, its AI chatbot app.\nThere\u2019s been a raft of deep research agents launched recently across chatbots, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google\u2019s Gemini, and xAI\u2019s Grok. Powering them are so-called reasoning AI models, which posses the ability to think through problems and fact-check themselves \u2014 skills arguably important for conducting in-depth research on a subject.\nMicrosoft\u2019s flavors are called Researcher and Analyst.\nResearcher combines OpenAI\u2019s deep research model \u2014 which powers the company\u2019s own ChatGPT deep research tool \u2014 with \u201cadvanced orchestration\u201d and \u201cdeep search capabilities.\u201d Microsoft claims that Researcher can perform analyses including developing a go-to-market strategy and creating a quarterly report for a client.\nAs for Analyst, it\u2019s built on OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini reasoning model and is \u201coptimized to do advanced data analysis,\u201d Microsoft said. Analyst progresses through problems iteratively, taking steps to refine its \u201cthinking\u201d and provide a detailed answer to queries. Analyst can also run the programming language Python to tackle complex data queries, Microsoft added, and expose its \u201cwork\u201d for inspection.\nWhat makes Microsoft\u2019s deep research tools slightly more unique than the competition is their access to work data as well as the worldwide web. For example, Researcher can tap third-party data connectors to draw on data from AI \u201cagents,\u201d tools, and apps like Confluence, ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\nGranted, the real challenge is ensuring tools such as Researcher and Analyst don\u2019t hallucinate or otherwise make stuff up. Models including o3-mini and deep research are by no means perfect; from time to time, they mis-cite work, draw incorrect conclusions, and pull from dubious public websites to inform their reasoning.\nMicrosoft is launching a new Frontier program through which Microsoft 365 Copilot customers can gain access to Researcher and Analyst. Those enrolled in Frontier, which going forward will gain experimental Copilot features first, will get Researcher and Analyst starting in April.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle unveils a next-gen family of AI reasoning models\ndescription1:\nOn Tuesday, Google unveiled Gemini 2.5, a new family of AI reasoning models that pauses to \u201cthink\u201d before answering a question.\nTo kick off the new family of models, Google is launching Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, a multimodal, reasoning AI model that the company claims is its most intelligent model yet. This model will be available on Tuesday in the company\u2019s developer platform, Google AI Studio, as well as in the Gemini app for subscribers to the company\u2019s $20-a-month AI plan, Gemini Advanced.\nMoving forward, Google says all of its new AI models will have reasoning capabilities baked in.\nSince OpenAI launched the first AI reasoning model in September 2024, o1, the tech industry has raced to match or exceed that model\u2019s capabilities with their own. Today, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, and xAI all have AI reasoning models, which use extra computing power and time to fact-check and reason through problems before delivering an answer.\nReasoning techniques have helped AI models achieve new heights in math and coding tasks. Many in the tech world believe reasoning models will be a key component of AI agents, autonomous systems that can perform tasks largely sans human intervention. However, these models are also more expensive.\nGoogle has experimented with AI reasoning models before, previously releasing a \u201cthinking\u201d version of Gemini in December. But Gemini 2.5 represents the company\u2019s most serious attempt yet at besting OpenAI\u2019s \u201co\u201d series of models.\nGoogle claims that Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforms its previous frontier AI models, and some of the leading competing AI models, on several benchmarks. Specifically, Google says it designed Gemini 2.5 to excel at creating visually compelling web apps and agentic coding applications.\nOn an evaluation measuring code editing, called Aider Polyglot, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 68.6%, outperforming top AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Chinese AI lab DeepSeek.\nHowever, on another test measuring software dev abilities, SWE-bench Verified, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 63.8%, outperforming OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini and DeepSeek\u2019s R1, but underperforming Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which scored 70.3%.\nOn Humanity\u2019s Last Exam, a multimodal test consisting of thousands of crowdsourced questions relating to mathematics, humanities, and the natural sciences, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro scores 18.8%, performing better than most rival flagship models.\nTo start, Google says Gemini 2.5 Pro is shipping with a 1 million token context window, which means the AI model can take in roughly 750,000 words in a single go. That\u2019s longer than the entire \u201cLord of The Rings\u201d book series. And soon, Gemini 2.5 Pro will support double the input length (2 million tokens).\nGoogle didn\u2019t publish API pricing for Gemini 2.5 Pro. The company says it\u2019ll share more in the coming weeks.\n\ntitle2:\nChatGPT's image-generation feature gets an upgrade\ndescription2:\nDuring a livestream on Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced the first major upgrade to ChatGPT\u2019s image-generation capabilities in over a year.\nChatGPT can now leverage the company\u2019s GPT-4o model to natively create and modify images and photos. GPT-4o has long underpinned the AI-powered chatbot platform, but until now, the model has been able to generate and edit only text \u2014 not images.\nAltman said GPT-4o native image generation is live today in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI\u2019s AI video-generation product, for subscribers to the company\u2019s $200-a-month Pro plan. OpenAI says the feature is rolling out soon to Plus and free users of ChatGPT, as well as developers using the company\u2019s API service.\nGPT-4o with image output \u201cthinks\u201d a bit longer than the image-generation model it effectively replaces, DALL-E 3, to make what OpenAI describes as more accurate and detailed images. GPT-4o can edit existing images, including images with people in them \u2014 transforming them or \u201cinpainting\u201d details like foreground and background objects.\nTo power the new image feature, OpenAI told the Wall Street Journal it trained GPT-4o on \u201cpublicly available data,\u201d as well as proprietary data from its partnerships with companies like Shutterstock.\nMany generative AI vendors see training data as a competitive advantage, so they keep it and any information related to it close to the chest. But training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive for companies to reveal much.\n\u201cWe\u2019re respecting of the artists\u2019 rights in terms of how we do the output, and we have policies in place that prevent us from generating images that directly mimic any living artists\u2019 work,\u201d said Brad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s chief operating officer, in a statement to the Journal.\nOpenAI offers an opt-out form that allows creators to request that their works be removed from its training datasets. The company also says that it respects requests to disallow its web-scraping bots from collecting training data, including images, from websites.\nChatGPT\u2019s upgraded image-generation feature follows on the heels of Google\u2019s experimental native image output for Gemini 2.0 Flash, one of the company\u2019s flagship models. The powerful feature went viral on social media \u2014 but not necessarily for the best reasons. Gemini 2.0 Flash\u2019s image component turned out to have few guardrails, allowing people to remove watermarks and create images depicting copyrighted characters.\nThis article was update at 12pm PT to include OpenAI\u2019s statement to the Wall Street Journal around GPT-4o\u2019s training data.\n\ntitle3:\nBill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems hits key reactor construction milestone\ndescription3:\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) marked a major milestone Tuesday morning, announcing the installation of a key component of its SPARC demonstration reactor.\nThe new part is a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle that forms the foundation of the tokamak, the doughnut-shaped heart of a fusion reactor that CFS hopes will be the first of its kind to generate more power than it consumes. Called the cryostat base, it was made in Italy and shipped halfway around the world to CFS\u2019s site in Devens, Massachusetts.\n\u201cIt is the first piece of the actual fusion machine,\u201d Alex Creely, director of tokamak operations at CFS, told TechCrunch. Work at the site has been underway now for more than three years as the company constructs the buildings and machinery that will support the reactor\u2019s core.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for us, because it means we\u2019re transitioning into a new stage of the project where we\u2019re not building an industrial facility \u2014 we\u2019re still doing that a bit \u2014 but we\u2019re also now building the actual tokamak itself,\u201d he said.\nCFS is one of many startups that have emerged in recent years to pursue fusion power, which promises to deliver gigawatts of pollution-free electricity from a hydrogen fuel derived from seawater. Investors have been counting on the technology to meet future power needs, which are skyrocketing as heavy users like electric vehicles and data centers proliferate.\nThe company, which is backed by Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, among other investors, is widely considered to be one of the best prospects to prove whether fusion power is commercially feasible. The company announced in December that its first commercial-scale reactor will be located outside Richmond, Virginia.\nSparc is expected to come online in 2027, and if it works as CFS anticipates, it could be the first tokamak to produce more power than it takes to run. So far, only the Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facility has been able to hit so-called scientific break-even in a string of successful experiments, the first of which occurred in December 2022.\nBut the NIF\u2019s reactor differs significantly from CFS\u2019s, using lasers to compress a fuel pellet to fusion conditions. CFS\u2019s tokamak uses magnets to herd 100 million degree C plasma into a tight doughnut shape, confining and compressing it until fusion occurs.\nTokamaks use superconducting magnets to generate the powerful magnetic fields required to coral the plasma. Those magnets need to be cooled to \u2013253 degrees C using liquid helium. The cryostat helps maintain those frigid conditions, acting like a thermos by insulating it from ambient temperatures. \u201cThe cryostat base is basically like the bottom of the thermos,\u201d Creely said.\nJust like someone receiving an Amazon package, CFS had to unbox and inspect the cryostat base before installing it. But unlike an e-commerce package that takes a few seconds to open, it took the CFS team a few days to remove the shipping material and another week \u201cjust to make sure that nothing got damaged in shipping,\u201d Creely said.\nThe CFS team then moved the cryostat base to the tokamak hall, where precisely placed bolts protruded from the concrete foundation awaiting the stainless steel disk. \u201cThen you grout it in,\u201d he said.\nAlongside the cryostat base, work continues on the other three major pieces of the tokamak, which will be assembled simultaneously into their final configuration either late this year or early next year. After that, CFS will ensure all the pieces are working together as planned, a process known as commissioning, which will take months.\n\u201cThis is the first of a kind,\u201d Creely said. \u201cThere\u2019s not just like an on button and it turns on.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nCerebras Systems' IPO is further delayed\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAI chipmaking company Cerebras Systems\u2019 IPO is delayed again as the public listing\u2019s national security review drags on.\nCerebras, which originally filed its intent to IPO in September 2024, thought the incoming Trump administration would help it breeze through its national security review, according to Reuters. That hasn\u2019t been the case.\nThe White House has yet to fill multiple vacancies, including the assistant Treasury secretary for investment security \u2014 the position that oversees the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2014 which means the department that oversees these types of reviews is incomplete, Reuters reports.\nThe chipmaker\u2019s IPO originally triggered a national security review due to a $335 million investment the company received from Abu Dhabi-based G42, an AI holding company, with previous ties to Chinese tech giant Huawei.\nCerebras declined to comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
