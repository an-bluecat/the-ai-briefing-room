Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Redmond first crossed the mark in July, but its valuation then dropped slightly to $3.9 trillion, before returning to $4 trillion on Tuesday on the back of news that it had signed a new agreement with OpenAI.\nApple\u2019s growth has been impressive: It reached $1 trillion in 2018, $2 trillion in 2020, and $3 trillion in 2022. Apple\u2019s stock has soared following the launch of the iPhone 17 range, which seem to be outselling previous versions. The company is set to report its Q4 2025 results on Thursday, October 30.\nMicrosoft has also been thriving, thanks to demand for its Azure cloud service, which offers OpenAI\u2019s large language models as well as the computing power needed to train AI models. The company said on Tuesday that its roughly 27% stake in OpenAI was valued at about $135 billion. The tech giant reports its quarterly results on Wednesday.\nAlphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is getting close to the $4 trillion milestone, too: It\u2019s currently trading at a market capitalization of $3.25 trillion.\n\ntitle1:\nWaabi unveils autonomous truck made in partnership with Volvo\ndescription1:\nSelf-driving truck startup Waabi shared Tuesday at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 the launch of a new autonomous truck made in partnership with Volvo, the Volvo VNL Autonomous truck.\nThe unveiling comes eight months since the Uber- and Nvidia-backed startup announced it was partnering with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to build a custom truck based on Volvo\u2019s autonomy platform using Waabi\u2019s software stack.\nWaabi CEO Raquel Urtasun said on TechCrunch Disrupt\u2019s AI stage the company has the potential to be the first to commercialize self-driving trucks without a human safety driver or observer. The comment was a slight dig at Aurora, a competitor that launched a commercial driverless service earlier this year. The company later added a human observer in the truck cab several weeks later.\n\u201cWe can drive in generalized surface streets across right now in Texas, and you will be able to see us across the entire U.S. over the next few years as well,\u201d said Urtasun, who previously served as chief scientist at Uber ATG before launching Waabi in 2021.\nWaabi rival Aurora has a similar deal with Volvo, and the two companies unveiled a self-driving truck in May 2024. Aurora launched a commercial service, which has a human observer on board, earlier this year on a route between Dallas and Houston. On Tuesday, it announced it was expanding to El Paso. Waabi is using the same truck, but it features Waabi\u2019s tech, including its sensor suite, compute, and the Waabi Driver software.\nWaabi\u2019s self-driving system called the Waabi Driver is an end-to-end AI model that enables the truck to scale autonomous driving across different geographies, including highways and general surface streets. Waabi says this enables commercial operations that are scalable, meet the needs of customers, and work within existing logistics operations.\n\u201cVolvo VNL has been built from the ground up for the redundancies so that you can remove the human driver and you can build a global, safe, robust product,\u201d Urtasun said. \u201cOur sensor pods are super lightweight; it\u2019s very easy to integrate at the factory line.\u201d\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWaabi\u2019s partnership with Volvo builds on the automaker\u2019s investment into the startup in 2023 via its venture arm, Volvo Group Venture Capital. Volvo participated in Waabi\u2019s $200 million Series B in 2024.\nClarification: Aurora did not initially launch its commercial service with a human observer in the cab.\n\ntitle2:\nTata Motors confirms it fixed security flaws, which exposed company and customer data\ndescription2:\nIndian automotive giant Tata Motors has fixed a series of security flaws that exposed sensitive internal data, including personal information of customers, company reports, and data related to its dealers.\nSecurity researcher Eaton Zveare told TechCrunch that he discovered the flaws in Tata Motors\u2019 E-Dukaan unit, an e-commerce portal for buying spare parts for Tata-made commercial vehicles. Headquartered in Mumbai, Tata Motors produces passenger cars, as well as commercial and defense vehicles. The company has a presence in 125 countries worldwide and seven assembly facilities, per its website.\nZveare said he found that the portal\u2019s web source code included the private keys to access and modify data within Tata Motors\u2019 account on Amazon Web Services, the researcher said in a blog post.\nThe exposed data, Zveare told TechCrunch, included hundreds of thousands of invoices containing customer information, such as their names, mailing addresses, and permanent account number, or PAN, a ten-character unique identifier issued by the Indian government.\n\u201cOut of respect for not causing some type of alarm bell or massive egress bill at Tata Motors, there were no attempts to exfiltrate large amounts of data or download excessively large files,\u201d the researcher told TechCrunch.\nThere were also MySQL database backups and Apache Parquet files that included various bits of private customer information and communication, the researcher noted.\nThe AWS keys also enabled access to over 70 terabytes of data related to Tata Motors\u2019 FleetEdge fleet-tracking software. Zveare also found backdoor admin access to a Tableau account, which included data of over 8,000 users.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

This primarily includes things like internal financial reports, performance reports, dealer scorecards, and various dashboards,\u201d the researcher said.\nThe exposed data also included API access to Tata Motors\u2019 fleet management platform, Azuga, which powers the company\u2019s test drive website.\nShortly after discovering the issues, Zveare reported them to Tata Motors through the Indian computer emergency response team, known as CERT-In, in August 2023. Later in October 2023, Tata Motors told Zveare that it was working on fixing the AWS issues after securing the initial loopholes. However, the company did not say when the issues were fixed.\nTata Motors confirmed to TechCrunch that all the reported flaws were fixed in 2023, but would not say if it notified affected customers that their information was exposed.\n\u201cWe can confirm that the reported flaws and vulnerabilities were thoroughly reviewed following their identification in 2023 and were promptly and fully addressed,\u201d said Tata Motors communications head Sudeep Bhalla, when contacted by TechCrunch.\n\u201cOur infrastructure is regularly audited by leading cybersecurity firms, and we maintain comprehensive access logs to monitor for unauthorized activity. We also actively collaborate with industry experts and security researchers to strengthen our security posture and ensure timely mitigation of potential risks,\u201d said Bhalla.\n\ntitle3:\nLG Uplus is latest South Korean telco to confirm cybersecurity incident\ndescription3:\nLG Uplus, one of the largest telecom operators in South Korea, has confirmed to TechCrunch that it has reported a suspected data breach to Korea\u2019s national cybersecurity watchdog KISA, but did not say when the results of its investigation would be available.\nAll three major South Korean telecom providers, SK Telecom, KT Telecom, and now LG Uplus, have reported cybersecurity incidents over the past six months, pending confirmation from the Korean government.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Ministry of Science and ICT told TechCrunch that its investigation into KT and LG Uplus, launched last month, is still ongoing, amid a report that the companies may have faced cyberattacks similar to the recent breach at SK Telecom.\nBack in July, KISA also reportedly spotted signs of a possible hack and asked LG Uplus to file a formal report. In August, LG\u2019s telecom division initially denied any signs of a breach, even as KT reported that data from users had been exposed following the connection of unauthorized micro base stations to its network. KISA declined to comment.\nThe move comes about two months after the hacking magazine Phrack claimed that hackers from China or North Korea had stolen data from close to 9,000 LG Uplus servers.\nLG Uplus\u2019s report comes amid a wave of high-profile hacks in South Korea affecting telecoms, credit card companies, tech startups, and government agencies, highlighting vulnerabilities previously reported by TechCrunch.\nSouth Korea\u2019s fragmented cybersecurity system and a shortage of experts have hindered the country\u2019s response to the cyber threats.\n\ntitle4:\nHere are the 5 Startup Battlefield finalists at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025\ndescription4:\nAfter two days full of live demos and pitches, it\u2019s time to announce the five finalists at this year\u2019s Startup Battlefield.\nThese finalists were selected from an initial pool of thousands of applicants, with TechCrunch\u2019s editorial team narrowing the field down to the 200 companies that all joined us here at Disrupt, with the Top 20 competing on the Disrupt Stage.\nWith feedback from our expert judges, we\u2019ve now selected our finalists, who will take the stage one more time at 11:30 a.m. PT on Wednesday to compete for our grand prize of $100,000 in equity-free funding, as well as temporary custody of the Startup Battlefield Cup. You can watch the finals on the livestream on the TechCrunch website \u2014 or, if you\u2019re attending the conference, on the Disrupt Stage.\nWithout further ado, here are the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield finalists for 2025:\nCharter Space\nCharter Space has built a dev tool for aerospace engineers, but its real mission is to serve as a fintech company for space. The software captures manufacturing and test data directly from the source, and this dataset then feeds an underwriting interface that ties directly in with the largest insurance carriers in the market. The goal is faster, cheaper, and more reliable risk evaluation for spacecraft insurance, and eventually to power new forms of credit and nondilutive funding for space companies looking outside venture capital and the public markets.\nGl\u012bd\nGl\u012bd (pronounced \u201cGlide\u201d) aims to streamline the complex, multistep process involved in moving a container from a ship to a freight train. The company has developed several hardware and software products to speed up and reduce the cost of getting shipping containers to the railhead and eventually their destination. Its first product is GliderM, a hybrid-electric vehicle with a hook on the back that can pick up and move 20-foot containers directly to the rail without the need for forklifts of hostler trucks.\nMacroCycle\nMacroCycle has developed a shortcut, of sorts, that promises to make recycled plastic as inexpensive as virgin material. The startup has devised a way to pluck desirable synthetic fibers from waste textiles, leaving everything else behind. Unlike most chemical recycling, MacroCycle\u2019s process differs because it doesn\u2019t break down polymers. Instead, it loops the polymer chains back on themselves, forcing them into rings called macrocycles, which remain behind after contaminants are washed away.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nNephrogen\nNephrogen is a biotech startup that uses AI and advanced screening to develop a specialized delivery system for safely getting gene-editing medicines into the exact cells in the kidney. Founder Demetri Maxim says that after three years of development, Nephrogen has succeeded in creating a delivery mechanism that is 100 times more efficient at transporting medicine to the kidney than the \u201cvehicles\u201d currently approved by the FDA. And he plans to participate in the clinical study himself, given the challenges he faces living with polycystic kidney disease.\nUnlisted Homes\nUnlisted Homes is like Zillow but for houses that are not yet on the market. Using public records of 21 million homes, Unlisted created \u201cprofiles\u201d for each property, providing the same kind of information that you would find on any other real estate listings site. The company doesn\u2019t plan to facilitate real estate transactions through the platform, since the resources for those transactions already exist. Instead, Unlisted will sell sponsorships on individual ZIP codes to real estate agents, who will be listed as local experts on every home in that ZIP code.\"\n\nResponse:",
