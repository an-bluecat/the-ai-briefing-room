Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

The ChatGPT Go plan will also enable better memory retention for more personalized responses, Turely said.\nWe just launched ChatGPT Go in India, a new subscription tier that gives users in India more access to our most popular features: 10x higher message limits, 10x more image generations, 10x more file uploads, and 2x longer memory compared with our free tier. All for Rs. 399. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 \u2014 Nick Turley (@nickaturley) August 19, 2025\n\u201cMaking ChatGPT more affordable has been a key ask from users! We\u2019re rolling out Go in India first and will learn from feedback before expanding to other countries,\u201d Turley said.\nFrom a currency conversion standpoint, the Plus plan was higher than $20 for Indian users when offered in local currency. The new Go plan offers a more affordable alternative to people who are looking to use ChatGPT primarily for chat, image generation, and file processing.\nTibor Blaho, a software engineer with a reputation for accurately leaking upcoming AI products, had previously teased this plan and its details.\nWhile the company is geo restricting this plan to India, the company said on its support page that it is working to expand this plan to more regions.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nLast month, Turley noted that ChatGPT now has more than 700 million weekly users worldwide \u2014 up from 500 million in March. OpenAI launched its updated image generator feature for ChatGPT in March, and since then it has seen an uptick in usage in India.\nAccording to app analytics firm AppFigures, India has been the leading country in terms of ChatGPT app downloads across platforms, with over 29 million downloads coming from the country in the last 90 days. However, the app only made $3.6 million in this period from users in the country.\nThis move will likely nudge more consumers to subscribe to using ChatGPT more, given its pricing. Other AI companies have also made moves to attract users from the country\u2019s internet user base of over 850 million. Last month, Perplexity partnered with network provider Airtel to offer free Perplexity Pro subscriptions. Google also dished up a free AI Pro plan for India-based students for one year.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s move is not giving out any freebies, local and affordable pricing will likely result in a better subscription conversion rate for ChatGPT in India.\n\ntitle1:\nSoftBank makes $2B investment in Intel\ndescription1:\nJapanese conglomerate SoftBank has agreed to make a $2 billion investment in Intel in a deal described as a commitment to advanced technology and semiconductors in the United States.\nThe agreement, in which SoftBank will buy Intel common stock, was announced Monday after markets closed. SoftBank will pay $23 per share of Intel common stock. Shares of Intel, which closed at $23.66, popped more than 5% in after-hours trading.\nSoftBank Group Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement that the \u201cstrategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.\u201d\nThe investment provides validation for Intel, which has been overshadowed in recent years by competitors like Nvidia. It also reflects SoftBank\u2019s renewed interest in the U.S., particularly around AI chips. SoftBank recently purchased a factory in Lordstown, Ohio, owned by Foxconn, as part of a plan to build AI data centers.\nIntel, steered by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, is in the midst of a restructuring that aims to streamline the semiconductor business and focus on its core client and data center portfolio. Earlier this summer, Intel shuttered its automotive architecture business and laid off most of its staff. It also announced plans to reduce its Intel Foundry division workforce between 15% and 20%.\nTan has also had to navigate political landmines in recent weeks as President Donald Trump called for his resignation due to conflicts of interest \u2014 an accusation that was made without evidence \u2014 and his administration reportedly had discussions to take a stake in Intel.\nThe SoftBank-Intel deal comes just days after the Trump administration threatened new tariffs on imported semiconductor chips as part of his strategy to boost domestic production.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

In July 2025, X downloads on Google Play saw a significant decline, as new installs dropped by 44% year-over-year worldwide, even as iOS downloads grew by 15%.\nThis steep drop in installs is pulling down X\u2019s overall average, leading to a 26% decrease in total mobile downloads year-over-year as of July. That\u2019s still slightly better than the month prior, when total downloads had fallen by 35%, thanks to another sharp drop in Android downloads, which were then down by nearly half (49%) year-over-year.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nThe firm didn\u2019t speculate on what\u2019s causing the decline on Android devices beyond suggesting that the X app on Android is known to be a sore spot for the company. Recently hired X head of product Nikita Bier, known for growth hacking teen social apps like Gas and TBH (then selling them), has hinted that X is looking to address issues on Android, where its app is notoriously buggy and often crashes.\nIn a post on the platform, Bier announced that X was hiring for its \u201cAndroid Dream Team\u201d to work on rebuilding the X Android app. He also recently posted that X\u2019s iOS app had just seen a record week in terms of installs, perhaps hoping to draw attention away from the large Android slump.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nIt\u2019s not clear where would-be X Android users are going. Rival Bluesky has seen slowing growth in recent months, and its Google Play app pulled in just 119,000 downloads in July. That\u2019s nowhere near the millions that install X on iOS or Android every month. However, Meta\u2019s Threads daily active users have been catching up to X on mobile devices, so, possibly, some Android users could be accounted for there.\nIn addition to the drop in Google Play installs, X is struggling to grow its subscription revenue, Appfigures found.\nIn July, X earned $16.9 million in net revenue, down from the $18.8 million it earned in March 2025. However, that was a slight tick up from the $16.8 million it generated in June. (Of course, X still earns the majority of its overall revenue from ads, not in-app premium subscriptions.)\nWhile the declining demand for X on Android is partially to blame for revenue declines, X is also likely losing paying customers to Grok. The latter now has its own stand-alone app that attracts those who were buying X subscriptions primarily for the AI perks.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Apple\u2019s hardware event is expected to take place in September.\nThe tech giant has made its intentions clear to grow the Pixel line, likely incorporating more generative AI capabilities with Gemini. Made by Google starts at 10 a.m. PT on Wednesday.\nGet ready for a Gemini boost\nImage Credits:Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\nGoogle already dropped several AI-related updates at its developer conference in May, but the company will likely demonstrate more Gemini features during the Pixel 10 event. In a recent YouTube video promoting the new devices, Google even seemed to poke fun at Apple\u2019s failed promises with Apple Intelligence advancements on the iPhone.\nRumors are buzzing about a feature called \u201cCamera Coach,\u201d which would let Gemini give you real-time tips for taking better photos. The AI is supposedly able to see what\u2019s going on and suggest the best angles and lighting for your shot.\nThere\u2019s also talk of a conversational photo editing tool, where you tell Gemini what you want to tweak in a photo, such as increasing the brightness, removing objects, or changing the background.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL\nThe standard Pixel 10 phone is expected to undergo significant changes, particularly with the addition of a dedicated telephoto lens, a feature that was previously exclusive to the Pro models. Following the leak of renders showcasing the third rear lens, Google released a teaser for the Pixel 10, confirming the substantial camera upgrade.\nAdditionally, all phones in the lineup are expected to be powered by a new Tensor G5 processor, ushering in the Gemini era and enhancing performance and power efficiency compared to the Tensor G4 chip.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nImage Credits:Google\nAside from these updates, not many obvious changes appear to be on the table. The basic design of the phones will likely remain similar to that of the Pixel 9 series. The displays are also expected to stay the same, with the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro featuring a 6.3-inch display, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL with a larger 6.8-inch display.\nSome areas where the Pro models may see improvement are camera and video quality, along with battery size, which could allow for faster charging and could address the longevity gap between Pixel and flagship phones from Apple and Samsung.\nPlus, there is talk that the Pixel 10 series could support Qi2 wireless charging. If true, this means it would be one of the few Android phones to work with magnetic accessories, such as chargers, wallets, and mounts. Google is also reportedly launching a \u201cPixelsnap\u201d phone case with a magnetic ring in the center.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold\nAs for Google\u2019s upcoming foldable, there are rumors suggesting it\u2019ll have a larger cover display, measuring at around 6.4 inches, alongside an 8-inch main screen. Additionally, Google is reportedly enhancing the strength of the hinge, and the bezels are expected to be thinner for a sleek appearance.\nAnother exciting rumor is the possibility of an IP68 rating, a first for the device. (And according to leaked specs, this may in fact be coming.) This means it can stand up to both dust and water, whereas the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has zero dust protection.\nLike the other Pixel 10 phones, the Pro Fold will likely be powered by the new G5 chip and include the latest Gemini AI features. The camera system might also receive improvements, potentially featuring a 48-megapixel ultra-wide lens and a telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. The phone should also likely get a bump in battery life.\nThe Pixel 10 may come in Moonstone and Jade colors.\nThe Pixel Watch and Pixel Buds\nImage Credits:Google\nWearables will also get their time to shine at Google\u2019s event, with the Pixel Watch 4 rumored to get a thicker design, a longer battery life, and smaller bezels.\nThere\u2019s also a strong likelihood that the smartwatch will introduce new health and fitness-tracking capabilities, possibly including an upgraded blood oxygen (SpO2) monitoring function.\nLeaks of the Pixel Buds 2a indicate that the earbuds will come in new colors (Fog Light, Hazel, Iris, and Strawberry) along with features like active noise cancellation. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will also reportedly come in a new Sterling color.\nThis story has been updated to include additional rumors.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Bleeping Computer reports that the hack was discovered on August 6.\nWorkday did not identify the breached third-party customer database platform, but follows in a recent spate of cyberattacks targeting Salesforce-hosted databases used by large companies to store customer data. In recent weeks, Google, Cisco, airline giant Qantas, and retailer Pandora have all had reams of data stolen from their Salesforce databases.\nGoogle attributed the breaches to ShinyHunters, a group of hackers known for using voice phishing to steal corporate data by tricking company employees into granting them access to their cloud-based databases. Google said ShinyHunters was likely in the process of preparing a data leak site to extort its victims into paying the hackers to delete the data, akin to how ransomware gangs operate.\nConnor Spielmaker, a spokesperson for Workday, did not comment beyond Workday\u2019s blog post or answer TechCrunch\u2019s questions, including whether Workday knows how many individuals had data stolen or who the stolen data relates to, such as Workday employees or Workday\u2019s corporate customers. Workday would not say if it has the technical means, such as logs, to determine what customer data was exfiltrated.\nAs of the time of publication, Workday\u2019s blog post disclosing the breach contained a hidden \u201cnoindex\u201d tag in its source code, which instructs search engines to ignore the page, making it difficult for anyone searching the web to find the page.\nIt\u2019s not clear for what reason Workday is hiding its data breach notification from search engines.\nDo you know more about the Workday data breach or attacks targeting Salesforce databases?
