Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The filing also revealed that xAI is now valued at $45 billion, close to double its previous valuation.\nThe new cash brings xAI\u2019s total raised to $12 billion, adding to the $6 billion tranche xAI raised in May.\nAccording to the Financial Times, only investors who\u2019d backed xAI in its previous fundraising round were permitted to participate in this one. Reportedly, investors who helped finance Musk\u2019s Twitter acquisition were given access to up to 25% of xAI\u2019s shares.\n\u201cxAI\u2019s most powerful model yet \u2026 is currently training and we are now focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products,\u201d xAI said in a statement. \u201cThe funds from this financing round will be used to further accelerate our advanced infrastructure, ship groundbreaking products \u2026 and accelerate \u2026 research and development.\u201d\nRamping up AI\nMusk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, a flagship generative AI model that now powers a number of features on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium subscribers and free users in some regions.\nGrok has what Musk has described as \u201ca rebellious streak\u201d \u2014 a willingness to answer \u201cspicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.\u201d Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won\u2019t hear from ChatGPT.\nMusk has derided ChatGPT and other AI systems for being too \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201cpolitically correct,\u201d despite Grok\u2019s own unwillingness to cross certain boundaries and hedge on political subjects. He\u2019s also referred to Grok as \u201cmaximally truth-seeking\u201d and less biased than competing models, although there\u2019s evidence to suggest that Grok leans to the left.\nOver the past year, Grok has become increasingly ingrained in X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. At launch, Grok was only available to X users \u2014 and developers skilled enough to get the \u201copen source\u201d edition up and running.\nThanks to an integration with xAI\u2019s in-house image generation model, Aurora, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). The model can analyze images as well, and summarize news and trending events \u2014 imperfectly, mind.\nReports indicate that Grok may handle even more X functions in the future, from enhancing X\u2019s search capabilities and account bios to helping with post analytics and reply settings. X recently got a \u201cGrok button\u201d designed to help users discover \u201crelevant context\u201d and dive deeper into trending discussions and real-time events.\nxAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. The company launched an API in October, allowing customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services. And it just rolled out a standalone Grok iOS app to a test audience.\nMusk asserts that it hasn\u2019t been a fair fight.\nIn a lawsuit filed against OpenAI and Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s close collaborator, attorneys for Musk accuse OpenAI of \u201cactively trying to eliminate competitors\u201d like xAI by \u201cextracting promises from investors not to fund them.\u201d OpenAI, Musk\u2019s counsel says, also unfairly benefits from Microsoft\u2019s infrastructure and expertise in what the attorneys describe as a \u201cde facto merger.\u201d\nYet Musk often says that X\u2019s data gives xAI a leg up compared to rivals. Last month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts.\nMusk, it\u2019s worth noting, was one of the original founders of OpenAI, and left the company in 2018 after disagreements over its direction. He\u2019s argued in previous suits that OpenAI profited from his early involvement yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all.\nOpenAI, unsurprisingly, disagrees with Musk\u2019s interpretation of events. In a mid-December press release, the company characterized Musk\u2019s lawsuit as misleading, baseless, and a case of sour grapes.\nAn xAI ecosystem\nxAI has outlined a vision according to which its models would be trained on data from Musk\u2019s various companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and the models could then improve technology across those companies. xAI is already powering customer support for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink internet service, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the startup is said to be in talks with Tesla to provide R&D in exchange for some of the carmaker\u2019s revenue.\nTesla shareholders, for one, object to these plans. Several have sued Musk over his decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what\u2019s essentially a competing venture.\nNevertheless, the deals \u2014 and xAI\u2019s developer and consumer-facing products \u2014 have driven xAI\u2019s revenue to around $100 million a year. For comparison, Anthropic is reportedly on pace to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, and OpenAI is targeting $4 billion by the end of 2024.\nMusk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which was apparently built in just 122 days and is currently powered partly by portable diesel generators. The company hopes to upgrade the server farm, which contains 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, next year; in a press release, xAI said it plans to fully double that number. (Because of their ability to perform many calculations in parallel, GPUs are the favored chips for training and running models.)\nIn November, xAI won approval from the regional power authority in Memphis for 150MW of additional power \u2014 enough to power roughly 100,000 homes. To win the agency over, xAI pledged to improve the quality of the city\u2019s drinking water and provide the Memphis grid with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries. But some residents criticized the move, arguing it would strain the grid and worsen the area\u2019s air quality.\nTesla is also expected to use the upgraded data center to improve its autonomous driving technologies.\nxAI has expanded quite rapidly from an operations standpoint in the year since its founding, growing from just a dozen employees in March 2023 to over 100 today. In October, the startup moved into OpenAI\u2019s old corporate offices in San Francisco\u2019s Mission neighborhood.\nxAI has reportedly told investors it plans to raise more money next year.\nIt won\u2019t be the only AI lab raising immense cash. Anthropic recently secured $4 billion from Amazon, bringing its total raised to $13.7 billion, while OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October to grow its war chest to $17.9 billion.\nMegadeals like OpenAI\u2019s and Anthropic\u2019s drove AI venture capital activity to $31.1 billion across over 2,000 deals in Q3 2024, per PitchBook data.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Akio Kon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nArtificial intelligence is still an abstract concept for many everyday consumers unsure about how it will change their lives. But there's no question about whether businesses are finding value in it. Some of the biggest winners in this year's stock market rally that's seen the Nasdaq jump 33% and other U.S. indexes notch double-digit gains have direct ties to the rapid advancements in AI. Chipmaker Nvidia is among them, but it's not alone. The other standout theme that's driven this year's outperformers is crypto. Starting with the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, cryptocurrencies had a big 2024, punctuated by Donald Trump's election victory, which was funded heavily by the crypto industry. A number of stocks tied to crypto got a big boost. With four trading days left in the year, here are the five best-performing U.S. tech stocks of 2024 among companies valued at $5 billion or more.\nAppLovin\nAdam Foroughi, CEO of AppLovin. CNBC\nAppLovin entered the year with a market cap of about $13 billion and was best known for investing in a collection of mobile gaming studios that had produced titles like \"Woody Block Puzzle,\" \"Clockmaker\" and \"Bingo Story.\" As it exits the year, AppLovin's valuation has soared past $110 billion, making it worth more than Starbucks , Intel and Airbnb . At Tuesday's close, AppLovin shares are up 758% this year, far surpassing all other tech companies. While AppLovin went public in 2021, riding a Covid-era wave of excitement in online games, the business is now centered around online ads and booming profits from advancements in AI. Last year, AppLovin released the updated 2.0 version of its ad search engine called AXON, which helps put more targeted ads on the gaming apps the company owns and is also used by studios that license the technology. Software platform revenue in the third quarter increased 66% to $835 million, outpacing total growth of 39%. Net income in the quarter soared 300%, lifting the company's profit margin to 36.3% from 12.6% in the course of a year. AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi, whose net worth has swelled past $10 billion, is even more excited about what's coming. On the company's earnings call in November, Foroughi raved about a test e-commerce project that allows businesses to offer targeted ads in games. \"In all my years, It's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot,\" he said.\nMicroStrategy\nCostFoto | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nAfter climbing 346% in 2023, it was hard to imagine MicroStrategy's stock finding another gear. But it did. The company's share price has jumped 467% this year on the back of a bitcoin-buying strategy that's made founder Michael Saylor a crypto cult hero. In mid-2020, the company announced a plan to start buying bitcoin. Up to that point, MicroStrategy had been a middling business intelligence software vendor, but since then, its purchased over 444,000 bitcoins, using its ever-increasing share price as a way to sell stock, raise debt and buy more coin. It's now the world's fourth-largest holder of bitcoin, behind only creator Satoshi Nakamoto, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and crypto exchange Binance, with a stockpile valued at close to $44 billion. MicroStrategy's market cap has swelled from about $1.1 billion when it was just a software company to $80 billion today. While the rally was long underway prior to November, Trump's election victory last month added fuel. The stock is up 57% since then while bitcoin has gained about 44%. Trump once called bitcoin a \"scam,\" but he was the industry's preferred choice in this election and was backed heavily by some of the leading players, including Coinbase . \"With the red sweep, Bitcoin is surging up with tailwinds, and the rest of the digital assets will also begin to surge,\" Saylor told CNBC soon after the election. He said bitcoin remains the \"safe trade\" in the crypto space, but as a \"digital assets framework\" is put into place for the broader crypto market, \"there'll be a surge in the entire digital assets industry.\"\nPalantir\nAlex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, walks to the morning session at the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 10, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nPalantir had a lot of big runs in 2024 on its way to a 380% gain in its stock price. One of its best stretches came last month, when the software company boosted its revenue outlook a day ahead of the presidential election. The company, which sells data analytics tools to defense agencies, bumped up its target for 2024, with fourth-quarter guidance that blew away analysts' estimates. Palantir also topped results for the third quarter, leading CEO Alex Karp to declare in the earnings release, \"We absolutely eviscerated this quarter, driven by unrelenting AI demand that won't slow down.\" The stock jumped 23% on the earnings report and then another 8.6% the next day after Trump's win. Palantir co-founder and board member Peter Thiel was a big Trump booster in the 2016 campaign and helped organize a meeting with tech execs at Trump Tower soon after that election. Karp was one of the attendees. Karp, however, openly backed Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, in the 2024 campaign. He told The New York Times in a story published in August that Thiel's earlier support of Trump and the backlash that followed made it \"actually harder to get things done.\" Still, Wall Street has rallied behind Palantir following the election on optimism that more military spending will flow to the company. Karp's comments in the earnings report ahead of the election suggest the company would be fine either way. \"The growth of our business is accelerating, and our financial performance is exceeding expectations as we meet an unwavering demand for the most advanced artificial intelligence technologies from our U.S. government and commercial customers,\" Karp said in a letter to shareholders. Analysts expect revenue growth in 2025 of about 24% to $3.5 billion, according to LSEG.\nRobinhood\nDado Ruvic | Reuters\nRobinhood shares more than tripled in value this year, despite a 17% drop on Oct. 31, following disappointing earnings. Investors looked past those numbers a few days later, driving the stock up 20% after Trump's election win, as all things tied to crypto rallied. One of Robinhood's biggest growth engines is crypto, which retail investors can easily purchase on the app, alongside their stocks. Revenue from crypto transactions jumped 165% in the third quarter from a year earlier to $61 million, accounting for 10% of total net revenue. In addition to bitcoin, Robinhood users can easily buy about 20 other cryptocurrencies, ranging from popular digital assets like ethereum to alt-coins such as dogecoin, Shiba Inu and Bonk. At the company's investor day in November, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said that crypto is more than just an investment but also a \"disruptive technology that will change the underlying infrastructure beneath payments, loans and a wide variety of tradable assets.\" For the fourth quarter, analysts are expecting Robinhood to report revenue growth of over 70% to $805.7 million, according to LSEG, which would be the fastest rate of growth for any quarter since 2021, the year the company went public. Robinhood's rally this year has exceeded that of Coinbase, which has jumped 61%. But with a market cap of $70 billion, Coinbase is still twice as valuable.\nNvidia\nwatch now\nNvidia's astounding run has continued. Following last year's 239% gain, powered by excitement around generative AI, Nvidia soared another 183% this year, adding a whopping $2.2 trillion in market cap. Twice this year Nvidia grabbed the title of world's most valuable publicly traded company. Apple has jumped back ahead and is approaching $4 trillion, with Nvidia at $3.4 trillion and Microsoft at $3.3 trillion. Nvidia remains the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as the largest cloud vendors and internet companies snap up all the graphics processing units they can find. Annual revenue has increased by at least 94% in each of the past six quarters, with growth exceeding 200% three times in that stretch. CEO Jensen Huang said in the company's latest earnings report that the next-generation AI chip called Blackwell is in \"full production.\" Finance chief Colette Kress said the company is on track for \"several billion dollars\" of Blackwell revenue in its fourth quarter. \"Every customer is racing to be the first to market,\" Kress said. \"Blackwell is now in the hands of all of our major partners, and they are working to bring up their data centers.\" While growth is expected to remain robust for a company of Nvidia's size, the inevitable slowdown is coming. Analysts are projecting year-over-year deceleration over the next several quarters with growth dipping into the mid-40s by the second half of next year. Nvidia counts on an outsized amount of revenue from a handful of tech giants, so any economic swings present significant risk to investors. That helps explain why Nvidia likes to tell Wall Street about the extensive roster of companies that are building new AI services and \"are racing to accelerate development of these applications with the potential for billions of agents to be deployed in the coming years,\" Kress said on the earnings call. WATCH: Next year is a 'stock-picker's market'\n\ntitle2:\n$132K - $149K, here's what seed-stage founders pay early employees, based on data\ndescription2:\nOnce a startup has raised its seed round, the perennial question becomes how much should the founders pay themselves and their first few employees?\nKruze Consulting, a CPA firm that specializes in venture-backed startups, recently analyzed average salary ranges for over 450 seed-stage startups and shared that data with TechCrunch.\nThe following averages are based on actual payroll records, not survey responses, Kruze says.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, technical engineering/product positions tend to be paid more than the CEO. One surprise is that a person with a title of COO/operations also tends to be paid even higher, on average. That\u2019s eyebrow-raising because an operations/COO title could signal to your seed VCs a third co-founder without a well-defined role \u2014 there are not a lot of operations to run in a tiny company. Even having that role can be a red flag on spending/budget to early-stage VCs.\nNevertheless, here are the average salaries of founder executives, according to Kruze:\nCEO: $132,000\n$132,000 CTO: $134,000\n$134,000 COO/Operations : $135,000\n: $135,000 Product/CPO: $149,000\nThose are not particularly high salaries, especially in the land of startups, the Bay Area. For instance, Kruze also found that very senior engineers enter seed startups with salaries ranging from $180,000 to $235,000 in the Bay Area and $160,000 to $210,000 in other areas. An entry-level engineer, on the other hand, even in San Francisco, can\u2019t command as much: $75,000 to $105,000 on average.\nIt should be noted that founders tend to give themselves healthy raises with each round they raise. The average pay in the founder executive category after the Series A is $183,000, and by Series B, it reaches $218,000.\nIn titles less likely to be a founder, here are employee starting salaries for initial hires, according to Kruze:\nEngineering, midlevel: $100,000 to $145,000 Bay Area; $90,000 to $130,000 other tech hubs\n$100,000 to $145,000 Bay Area; $90,000 to $130,000 other tech hubs Sales, midlevel: $80,000 to $110,000 Bay Area; $70,000 to $100,000 other\n$80,000 to $110,000 Bay Area; $70,000 to $100,000 other Product titles: $130,000 to $185,000 Bay Area; $110,000 to $175,000 other\n$130,000 to $185,000 Bay Area; $110,000 to $175,000 other Marketing, midlevel: $100,000 to $175,000 Bay Area; $80,000 to $145,000 other\nEmployees also tend to get equity \u2014 that\u2019s one of the allures of joining a startup. Data from Carta covering over 8,000 initial grants shows how much the first five hires can expect, which tends to be vested over four years.\nFirst hire: 0.5% to 4% equity (median 1.49%)\n0.5% to 4% equity (median 1.49%) Second: 0.3% to 2% equity (median 0.85%)\n0.3% to 2% equity (median 0.85%) Third: 0.21% to 1.2% equity (median 0.50%)\n0.21% to 1.2% equity (median 0.50%) Fourth: 0.18% to 1% equity (median 0.44%)\n0.18% to 1% equity (median 0.44%) Fifth: 0.13% to 0.8% equity (median 0.34%)\nThis story originally published December 2, 2024.\n\ntitle3:\nGV, the VC team backed by Google, has a broad remit, but it can't do one thing\ndescription3:\nDavid Krane is in an enviable position. As the CEO of GV, the venture firm that is funded entirely by Google to the tune of $1 billion a year, his team of roughly 100 gets to make a lot of bets \u2014 with just a couple of notable restrictions.\nDuring a TechCrunch StrictlyVC event in San Francisco earlier this month, Krane said GV has invested in a stunning 800 companies across the last five years and invested more than $10 billion across its 15-year history.\nNone has received as much in one shot as Uber, whose $258 million Series C round was funded solely by GV way back in 2013. Still, GV still goes big at times, for example, plugging $140 million into the data infrastructure startup Cribl back in August as part of a $319 million Series E round.\nIn fact, because GV invests purely for financial returns, Krane says, there are few limitations on how it can operate. To date, that has meant that GV has mostly invested in the U.S., with roughly half a billion invested in its second-biggest market, Europe. That has meant splitting half its time focused on life sciences, health care, and biotech, and the other half on an all-encompassing \u201cdigital\u201d category.\nThat degree of autonomy has also meant not having to navigate around a red line that separates what GV can fund from what Alphabet\u2019s growth stage outfit, CapitalG, can fund.\nAsked if the two groups ever throw elbows to get into a deal or a bigger share of a company \u2014 both teams are investors in Stripe, Cribl, and some other outfits \u2014 Krane poured cold water on the suggestion, saying that because \u201cwe\u2019re funded by the same source,\u201d the \u201csecret there is to communicate well.\u201d\nIndeed, one of the only apparent no-nos \u2014 beyond partnering with an outfit like OpenAI that competes directly with Google \u2014 is actively enticing talent inside of Google to start a company so that GV can be the first to fund it.\nWe asked while talking about members of Google\u2019s AI-driven note-taking tool NotebookLM, who recently left to start their own company \u2014 a story that TechCrunch broke on the day of our sit-down with Krane. When we wondered aloud whether GV might fund them, Krane said: \u201cWe know some of the people on the NotebookLM team, for sure, and we did know about this team that was spinning out.\u201d\n\u201cOccasionally, there are teams that will leave Google, that will pursue a startup, and GV will see it, and GV will get involved,\u201d he added. \u201c\u2026 We haven\u2019t set up a giant sucking vacuum to encourage people to leave Alphabet and pursue startups, but it does happen. There\u2019s a massively impressive diaspora of people that have spent time in parts of Alphabet that are now doing startups, and many of them are in our networks and we funded some of them.\u201d\nAsked how Google feels about GV writing a big check to people on their way out the door \u2014 it keeps them close to the mothership, after all, but can also encourage them to try their luck \u2014 Krane continued: \u201cYeah, I think that\u2019s exactly right. The goal is to stay at Google if you\u2019re at Google and build transformational products.\u201d But \u201csome people don\u2019t stay forever,\u201c he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact of life. Some people leave. Some people pursue startups, and then we may show up in that conversation.\u201d\nTo learn more, you can listen to that full conversation or watch it below.\n\ntitle4:\nHome for the holidays?

Nobody wants to experience the \u201coh s\u2014t\u201d moment of realizing you\u2019ve been hacked, or had your bank accounts or online wallets drained, yet many default to the mindset that \u201cit could never happen to me\u201d without realizing that their account passwords from yesteryear may not be a sufficient defense against today\u2019s hacking efforts.\nOftentimes, taking a few minutes with friends and family can be the impetus that they need to get started with cybersecurity, and stay protected.\nAs for what to suggest to your folks, I asked Rachel Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security, a company that provides security awareness training to help people defend against cyber threats before they strike; and Caitlin Condon, the vulnerability intelligence director at cybersecurity firm Rapid7, for their top security advice to share with friends and family. Their recommendations are to focus on the security basics that do the most work to keep your online accounts secure.\nAn important part of passing along effective security advice is helping your friends and family get started with the apps and security features they need to stay secure. This way, they can learn alongside you and build up those new habits and practices over time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often not enough to merely recommend or install security technologies; we need to help loved ones learn how to use these technologies to build confidence and trust,\u201d said Condon.\nSet up a password manager that stores complex and unique passwords\n\u201cWhen we go home for the holidays, a lot of times our family asks us for things that actually aren\u2019t the top thing that they need to focus on,\u201d said Tobac. It\u2019s no good giving a family member advice on cryptocurrency \u2014 for example \u2014 if they reuse the same password for every online account they have, Tobac said.\nThe best password is one that you never have to remember, and that\u2019s where a password manager can help. Password managers save your login details, and can also generate and store complex and unique passwords, so you never have to remember the same password across your various online services. (Using the same password across the internet makes all of those accounts more vulnerable to being hacked if someone guesses or steals your password.)\nThere are plenty of password managers out there to choose. Your browser may have one already, and iPhones and iPads have their own Passwords app. Bitwarden is also a popular free-to-use password manager that also lets you access your passwords from your phone.\n\u201cIt can help to sit down with loved ones, particularly if they aren\u2019t terribly tech-savvy, and walk them through setting up a master password, installing browser plugins, generating and storing new passwords \u2014 starting with financial or healthcare sites \u2014 and logging in and out of the password manager,\u201d said Condon.\nA common fear is forgetting or losing the master password that locks your password manager from outsiders, Condon said. Some people opt to have a copy of their master password written down and kept somewhere in their house for safekeeping.\n\u201cIn my experience, it\u2019s a lot less risky to write a master password down on paper and store that somewhere in your home than it is to reuse easily guessable passwords,\u201d said Condon.\nMulti-factor authentication can save the day\nPasswords alone are not enough to protect your accounts from intruders. Some of the biggest hacks of 2024 were possible because corporate giants forgot to implement basic security features, like multi-factor authentication (or MFA), allowing hackers to walk right in with just a stolen password.\nHaving a second layer of security like MFA (also known as two-factor) to your online accounts makes it far more difficult for anyone with just your password to access your account. MFA works by sending an additional second code by text message to a device that you own or prompting you to generate a code in an authenticator app.\n\u201cHelp them turn on multi-factor authentication, whether that\u2019s a code, or text message, especially for the essential accounts \u2014 like your email address account \u2014 which is the key to the castle for all of your other accounts,\u201d said Tobac.\nTobac also recommended locking down your phone provider\u2019s account with MFA, because \u2014 just like your email account \u2014 anyone with access to your phone number could gain access to any linked online account in case you ever forget your password. That\u2019s also why some prefer to use an authenticator app generated on a device instead of having a text message (which can be intercepted) sent to their phone.\nThere are plenty of authenticator apps; a popular choice is Duo Mobile, a simple app that generates second-factor codes on the fly while having an optional cloud backup in case you lose access to your phone.\nRemember that any MFA is better than none.\nBe \u2018politely paranoid\u2019 on the phone\n\u201cAnother thing I see folks struggle with regularly is the wave of spam texts, calls, emails, and notifications designed to social engineer users into visiting malicious websites or giving away logins and personal data,\u201d said Condon.\nOftentimes, letting a call go to voicemail can be an effective way of avoiding scams and fraud. Even with caller ID, phone calls inherently make it difficult to know for sure who the person you are speaking with is legitimate.\nTobac suggests being \u201cpolitely paranoid,\u201d a way of verifying that people and companies are who they say they are by contacting them back using a different method of communication before ever handing over information that could do harm, like a credit card number or a password. Tobac explained that if you get a call purportedly from your bank to say there are strange charges on your account, you can politely hang up the phone and call back using the official number on your bank card.\nThe same goes for anyone who calls you that might ask for information but you can\u2019t be sure who it is. You can check out the organization\u2019s website, app, or secure message inbox to check for yourself first before taking any action.\nHaving those common websites bookmarked in the browser for easy access can help your relatives verify any suspect call in a matter of seconds.\n\u201cHelp your loved ones bookmark official login pages they can visit safely to check secure messages or account transactions when they\u2019re concerned there might be something amiss,\u201d Condon. \u201cShow them how to navigate to those sites via pinned bookmarks or browser shortcuts.\u201d\nA password manager, multi-factor authentication and being \u201cpolitely paranoid\u201d on the phone are by far the simplest, yet most effective roadblocks for malicious hackers. Ensuring the cybersecurity foundations in place (and your loved ones understanding their importance) is a great place to start with friends and family, Tobac said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best gift you could give them,\u201d said Tobac. \u201cThe gift of not getting hacked.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
