But maybe the markets shouldn\u2019t have been taken by surprise. The deal is a reminder that, despite Oracle\u2019s legacy status, the company still plays a major role in AI infrastructure.\nOn the OpenAI side, the agreement was more revealing than the lack of details suggest. For one, the startup\u2019s willingness to pay so much for compute provides a measurement of the startup\u2019s appetite \u2014 even if it\u2019s unclear where the electricity to power said compute is coming from or how it will pay for it.\nChirag Dekate, a vice president at research firm Gartner, told TechCrunch it\u2019s clear why both sides were interested in this deal. It makes sense for OpenAI to work with several infrastructure providers, he noted. It also diversifies the company\u2019s infrastructure \u2014 spreading out risk among several cloud providers \u2014 and gives OpenAI a scaling advantage compared to competitors.\n\u201cOpenAI seems to be putting together one of the most comprehensive global AI supercomputing foundations for extreme scale, inference scaling where appropriate,\u201d Dekate said. \u201cThis is quite unique. This is probably exemplary of what a model ecosystem should look like.\u201d\nSome industry watchers expressed surprise that Oracle was involved, citing the company\u2019s diminished role in the AI boom compared to cloud rivals like Google, Microsoft Azure, and AWS. But Dekate argues that observers shouldn\u2019t be so surprised: Oracle has worked with hyperscalers before and provides the infrastructure for TikTok\u2019s sizable U.S. business.\n\u201cOver the decades, they actually built core infrastructure capabilities that enabled them to deliver extreme scale and performance as a core part of their cloud infrastructure,\u201d Dekate said.\nPayment and power\nBut even as the stock market celebrates the deal, key details are missing and questions around power and payment remain.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOpenAI has made a string of infrastructure investment announcements over the past year, each one with an eye-popping price tag. OpenAI has committed to spend around $60 billion a year for compute from Oracle and $10 billion to develop custom AI chips with Broadcom.\nMeanwhile, OpenAI said in June it hit $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, up from around $5.5 billion last year. That figure includes revenue from the company\u2019s consumer products, ChatGPT business products, and its API. And while its CEO Sam Altman has painted a rosy picture of its future prospects in terms of subscribers, products, and revenue, the company is burning through billions of dollars in cash each year.\nPower is another question, or more specifically where the companies plan to source the energy needed to run this level of compute.\nIndustry observers have been predicting a near-term boost for natural gas, though solar and batteries are arguably better positioned to deliver power sooner and at lower cost in many markets. Tech companies are also betting big on nuclear.\nDespite market moving headlines, the energy impact of OpenAI\u2019s anticipated growth isn\u2019t entirely unexpected. Data centers are anticipated to consume 14% of all electricity in the U.S. by 2040, according to a report the Rhodium Group published yesterday.\nCompute has always been a constraint for AI companies, so much so that investors have bought thousands of Nvidia chips to ensure their startups have access to the power they need. Andreessen Horowitz has reportedly purchased over 20,000 GPUs, while Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross rented access to a 4,000 GPU cluster (though maybe Meta owns that now).\nBut compute is worthless without power. To ensure their data centers remain juiced, large tech companies have been snapping up solar farms, buying nuclear power plants, and inking deals with geothermal startups.\nSo far, OpenAI has been relatively quiet on that front. CEO Sam Altman has placed several prominent bets in the energy sector, including Oklo, Helion, and Exowatt, but the company itself hasn\u2019t thrown money into the space like Google, Meta, or Amazon.\nWith a 4.5 gigawatt compute deal, that may soon change.\nThe company may play an indirect role, paying Oracle to handle the physical infrastructure \u2014 something it has extensive experience with \u2014 just as Altman invested in startups aligned with OpenAI\u2019s future power needs. That will leave the company \u201casset light,\u201d something that will undoubtedly please its investors and help keep its valuation in line with other software-centric AI startups and not with legacy tech firms, which are burdened with pricey infrastructure.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle is a 'bad actor' says People CEO, accusing the company of stealing content\ndescription1:\nThe CEO of the largest digital and print publisher in the U.S. has accused Google of being a bad actor for crawling its websites to support the search giant\u2019s AI products.\nNeil Vogel, CEO of People, Inc. (formerly Dotdash Meredith), a publisher that operates over 40 brands, including People, Food & Wine, Travel + Leisure, Better Homes & Gardens, Real Simple, Southern Living, Allrecipes, and others, said that Google is not playing fair because it uses the same bot to crawl websites to index them for the Google search engine as it does to support its AI features.\n\u201cGoogle has one crawler, which means they use the same crawler for their search, where they still send us traffic, as they do for their AI products, where they steal our content,\u201d said Vogel, speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference this week.\nHe noted that three years ago, Google Search accounted for about 65% of the company\u2019s traffic and that has since dropped to the \u201chigh 20s.\u201d (Vogel shared an even more startling statistic with AdExchanger last month, saying that as of several years ago, Google\u2019s traffic accounted for as much as 90% of People Inc.\u2019s traffic from the open web.)\n\u201cI\u2019m not complaining. We\u2019ve grown our audience. We\u2019ve grown our revenue,\u201d Vogel told conference attendees. \u201cWe\u2019re doing great. What is not right about this is: You cannot take our content to compete with us.\u201d\nVogel believes publishers need more leverage in the AI era, which is why he feels it\u2019s necessary to block AI crawlers \u2014 automated programs that scan websites to train AI systems \u2014 as that can force them into content deals. His company, for example, has a deal with OpenAI, which Vogel described as a \u201cgood actor.\u201d\nPeople Inc. has been leveraging web infrastructure company Cloudflare\u2019s latest solution to block AI crawlers that don\u2019t pay, prompting AI players to approach the publisher with potential content deals. While Vogel wouldn\u2019t directly name the companies involved, he said they were \u201clarge LLM providers.\u201d No deals have been signed yet, but Vogel said the company is \u201cmuch further along\u201d than before it adopted the crawler-blocking solution.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nHowever, Vogel pointed out, Google\u2019s crawler can\u2019t be blocked because doing so would also prevent the publisher\u2019s websites from being indexed in Google Search, cutting off that \u201c20%-ish\u201d of traffic that Google still delivers.\n\u201cThey know this, and they\u2019re not splitting their crawler. So they are an intentional bad actor here,\u201d Vogel declared.\nJanice Min, the editor-in-chief and CEO at newsletter provider Ankler Media, agreed, calling Big Tech companies like Google and Meta longtime \u201ccontent kleptomaniacs.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the benefit to us in partnering with any AI company right now,\u201d she said, adding that her company blocks AI crawlers.\nMeanwhile, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, whose company makes the AI-blocking solution (and who was also on the panel), said he believed that things would still change in the future when it comes to how the AI companies behave. He suspected those changes could be prompted by new regulations.\nThe Cloudflare exec also questioned whether fighting the AI companies using legal solutions around things like copyright law, created for the pre-AI era, was the right answer.\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to go down that path, because, in copyright law, typically, the more derivative something is, the more it\u2019s protected under fair use \u2026 What these AI companies are doing is they\u2019re actually creating derivatives,\u201d Prince said. \u201cAnd so if you look at the best case law that\u2019s come out so far, it\u2019s actually said that the use by Anthropic and others \u2014 the reason Anthropic settled recently with all the book publishers for $1.5 billion \u2014 was for them to be able to preserve the positive copyright ruling that they got.\u201d\nPrince also proclaimed that \u201ceverything that\u2019s wrong with the world today is, at some level, Google\u2019s fault,\u201d because the search giant had taught publishers to value traffic over original content creation, triggering publishers like BuzzFeed to write for clicks. Still, he admitted that Google was in a tough spot right now from a competitive standpoint.\n\u201cInternally, they\u2019re having massive fights about what they do, and my prediction is that, by this time next year, Google will be paying content creators for crawling their content and taking it and putting it in AI models,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle2:\nNew FAA program will let eVTOL startups test some operations before full certification\ndescription2:\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced a new pilot program that will let electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) startups test some operations before they receive full regulatory certification.\nIt\u2019s a potentially big change for these companies, as they\u2019ve spent the last few years performing limited test flights of their aircraft while working toward FAA approval. But the program has its limits.\nCompanies will have to partner with state, local, tribal, or territorial governments to apply to the program. The FAA says it will approve at least five projects that can run for up to three years, covering short-range air taxis, longer-range fixed wing flights, cargo hauling, logistics and supply for emergency or medical purposes, and \u201cincreasing automation safety.\u201d\nThe FAA is seeking applicants \u201cwho can deliver successful outcomes by working cooperatively with a range of entities, which will accelerate these projects consistent with the high safety standards that the public expects from the aviation industry,\u201d according to the official solicitation paperwork.\n\u201cThese projects, once successful, are expected to deliver substantial data and lessons learned to inform the broader regulatory framework that will support and oversee the AAM [advanced air mobility] sector,\u201d the agency writes.\nSo far on Friday, Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have announced that they plan to apply to the pilot program. Neither company has said which government entity they plan to apply with, though Archer noted it will work with existing partner (and investor) United Airlines. Applications are due on December 11, 2025, and the pilots might begin as soon as 2026.\n\ntitle3:\nMicro1, a competitor to Scale AI, raises funds at $500M valuation\ndescription3:\nMicro1, a three-year-old startup that helps AI companies find and manage human contractors for data labeling and training, has raised a $35 million Series A funding round that values the company at $500 million. The round was led by 01 Advisors, a venture capital firm co-founded by Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, the former CEO and COO of Twitter.\nThe startup is one of many companies looking to fill the gap in the data market created by recent changes involving Scale AI. After Meta invested $14 billion in Scale AI and hired its CEO, AI labs, including OpenAI and Google, said they planned to cut ties with the startup, presumably over concerns that their research could end up in Meta\u2019s hands. (Scale AI denies that it shares confidential information with Meta as part of its partnership.)\nHowever, AI labs still need these data services, and startups like Micro1 aim to pick up the slack.\nMicro1 CEO Ali Ansari \u2014 who is just 24 years old \u2014 tells TechCrunch that his company has been working with leading AI labs, including Microsoft, as well as several Fortune 100 companies. Ansari said Micro1 is now generating $50 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), up from $7 million at the start of 2025.\nThat\u2019s still a far cry from larger competitors like Mercor, which is generating more than $450 million in ARR, and Surge, which reportedly brought in $1.2 billion in 2024. However, Micro1\u2019s growth and adoption among AI labs seems to be growing at a healthy rate.\nAs part of the new funding, Micro1 is also adding Bain to its board of directors, alongside Joshua Browder, founder and CEO of the AI legal assistant DoNotPay.\n\u201cReally the only way models are now learning is through net new human data. Micro1 is at the core of providing that data to all frontier labs, while moving at speeds I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Bain said in a statement to TechCrunch.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nReuters previously reported details of Micro1\u2019s fundraising efforts.\nAll these companies \u2014 Micro1, Surge, Mercor, and Scale AI \u2014 supply AI labs with access to a large base of human contractors who can label and generate data for AI training. It\u2019s become a crucial service that companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google need to build cutting-edge AI models.\nScale AI was first to dominate this space, with the initial insight that it could pay relatively little for low-skilled contractors around the world to help label data for AI model training. However, Ansari says that the demands of AI labs have shifted in recent years and that companies now need high-quality data labeling from domain experts \u2014 such as senior software engineers, doctors, and professional writers \u2014 to improve their AI models. The hard part became recruiting these types of folks.\nThis led Micro1 to build its AI recruiter, Zara, which interviews and vets candidates who apply to work as one of the company\u2019s contractors, or as Ansari calls them, experts. Micro1 says Zara has recruited thousands of experts \u2014 including professors from Stanford and Harvard \u2014 and that the company plans to add hundreds more every week.\nThe market for AI training data appears to be changing yet again. Now, many AI labs are interested in working with startups to develop \u201cenvironments\u201d \u2014 virtual workspaces that can be used to train AI agents on simulated tasks. Ansari says Micro1 is building new offerings in the environments space to meet this demand.\nLuckily for startups like Micro1, AI labs seem to be working with multiple training data providers. The nature of the business is such that it\u2019s difficult for any one company to handle all of one AI lab\u2019s data needs. That means there\u2019s plenty of business to go around, at least for now.\n\ntitle4:\nVia shrugs off tepid open to end first day of trading slightly above IPO price\ndescription4:\nInvestors took a cautious approach to transit software startup Via\u2019s IPO on Friday, with shares opening below the company\u2019s IPO price before recovering at the end of the day slightly higher.\nThe company, which initially filed confidentially for IPO in July, priced its IPO at $46 per share, raising $492.9 million. Those shares slipped to $44 when the stock began trading Friday afternoon, and then inched back into the green to finish at just over $49. The modest gain values Via at roughly $3.9 billion at the close of its first trading day.\nVia raised about $328 million in its IPO, while existing shareholders sold another $164 million worth of stock, bringing the total deal size to nearly $493 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019re extremely pleased with the result of today\u2019s IPO, and we think it is a testament to the value and durability of the company,\u201d Via CEO Daniel Ramot said. \u201cWe are grateful for the feedback and support from our team, partners, and investors who made this milestone possible.\u201d\nVia initially launched in 2012 by deploying Via-branded shuttles that users could hail. Over time, Via improved its on-demand routing algorithm, which uses real-time data to route microtransit shuttles to where they\u2019re needed most. Now that tech is its core business, which it sells to 689 cities and transit agencies to power their microtransit.\nRamot told TechCrunch the company would use the proceeds to invest in growth, sales, and marketing. And maybe even an acquisition, in the future.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily looking to raise funds to drive operations,\u201d Ramot said. \u201cThere may be an opportunity for us to use the proceeds and the currency of a public stock to make some interesting acquisitions like we did with Remix and Citymapper.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
