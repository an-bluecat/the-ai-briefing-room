Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Chris Anderson, previously the CTO of Page-backed electric airplane startup Kittyhawk, is running the stealth effort, The Information reports.\nPage isn\u2019t the only entrepreneur exploring ways AI could be used to improve manufacturing processes (although he might be one of the richest).\nOrbital Materials is creating an AI platform that can be used to discover materials ranging from batteries to carbon dioxide-capturing cells. PhysicsX provides tools to run simulations for engineers working on project areas like automotive, aerospace, and materials science. Elsewhere, Instrumental is leveraging vision-powered AI to detect factory anomalies.\n\ntitle1:\nChatGPT doubled its weekly active users in under 6 months, thanks to new releases\ndescription1:\nOpenAI\u2019s flagship AI chatbot, ChatGPT, returned to solid growth in the latter half of 2024, according to a new report published on Thursday by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). While it took ChatGPT nine months to grow from 100 million weekly active users in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, it\u2019s now taken less than six months for the app to double those numbers yet again, the report found.\nShortly after its November 2022 release as a research preview, ChatGPT became the fastest app ever to reach 100 million monthly active users \u2014 a milestone it hit in only two months\u2019 time.\nBy November 2023, ChatGPT had reached another milestone of 100 million weekly active users, which grew to 300 million by December 2024, then 400 million in February 2025.\nAccording to a16z, initial consumer demand for ChatGPT was driven more by novelty. That is, consumers were interested in trying the app but weren\u2019t necessarily sure how it would fit into their everyday lives.\nHowever, ChatGPT\u2019s more recent growth comes on the heels of the release of new models and functionality, including the launch of GPT-4o, which added multimodal capabilities. Shortly after that model\u2019s launch, ChatGPT usage spiked from April through May 2024.\nLater, after the arrival of Advanced Voice Mode, usage grew again from July to August 2024. The o1 model series led to increased usage during September to October 2024.\nOn mobile, ChatGPT\u2019s growth has been more consistent, the firm points out.\nUsers of the ChatGPT mobile app have increased by 5% to 15% every month over the past year, with 175 million of ChatGPT\u2019s total 400 million weekly active users now accessing the app on mobile devices.\nThe report also examines the impact rivals like DeepSeek have had on the market. The app surged to No. 2 globally in just 10 days and reached No. 2 on mobile in February, capturing 15% of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile user base.\nOn mobile, DeepSeek users are even slightly more engaged than Perplexity and Claude users, according to data from mobile intelligence provider Sensor Tower. However, it still lags behind ChatGPT on this front.\nOther findings in the new market analysis include recommendations of tools for AI developers and coders, rankings of the top AI apps by category and revenue, and rankings of the top GenAI apps across mobile and web.\nOn the latter front, ChatGPT comes in at No. 1 by unique monthly visits on the web and monthly active users on mobile, the report noted, citing data from market intelligence provider Similarweb.\n\ntitle2:\nShield AI raises $240M at a $5.3B valuation to commercialize its AI drone tech\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nShield AI, the San Diego defense tech startup that builds drones and other AI-powered military systems, has raised a $240 million round at a $5.3 billion valuation, it announced today.\nShield AI says its Hivemind software already enables fighter jets and drones to fly autonomously. Now, Shield AI wants to sell Hivemind to a broader range of customers like robotics companies.\nThe round\u2019s investors include L3Harris, one of the U.S.\u2019s biggest defense contractors, and Hanwha Aerospace. Existing investors like Andreessen Horowitz also joined.\nThis makes Shield AI the second-largest defense tech startup in the U.S. by valuation, after Anduril, which is raising at a $28 billion valuation.\nAutonomy is a hot field in defense, with autonomous warship startup Saronic quadrupling its valuation to $4 billion in a $600 million round last month.\nShield AI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle3:\nAnthropic submits AI policy recommendations to the White House\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nA day after quietly removing Biden-era AI policy commitments from its website, Anthropic submitted recommendations to the White House for a national AI policy that the company says \u201cbetter prepare[s] America to capture the economic benefits\u201d of AI.\nThe company\u2019s suggestions include preserving the AI Safety Institute established under the Biden administration, directing NIST to develop national security evaluations for powerful AI models, and building a team within the government to analyze potential security vulnerabilities in AI.\nAnthropic also calls for hardened AI chip export controls, particularly restrictions on the sale of Nvidia H20 chips to China, in the interest of national security. To fuel AI data centers, Anthropic recommends the U.S. establish a national target of building 50 additional gigawatts of power dedicated to the AI industry by 2027.\nSeveral of the policy suggestions closely align with former President Biden\u2019s AI executive order, which Trump repealed in January. Critics allied with Trump argued that the order\u2019s reporting requirements were onerous.\n\ntitle4:\nScale AI is being investigated by the US Department of Labor\ndescription4:\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is investigating the data-labeling startup Scale AI for compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act, TechCrunch has learned.\nThat\u2019s a federal law that regulates unpaid wages, misclassification of employees as contractors, and illegal retaliation against workers.\nThe investigation has been active since at least August 2024, a document seen by TechCrunch shows. And it\u2019s ongoing, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.\nThe mere existence of an investigation doesn\u2019t mean Scale AI has done anything wrong, of course, and the investigation could find in favor of the company or be dismissed.\nScale AI is based in San Francisco and was valued last year at $13.8 billion. It relies on an army of workers it categorizes as contractors to do essential AI work, like labeling images for Big Tech and other organizations.\nScale AI spokesperson Joe Osborne told TechCrunch that the investigation was initiated during the previous presidential administration and that Scale AI felt that its work building, testing, and evaluating AI was misunderstood by regulators then.\nOsborne said that Scale AI has worked extensively with the DOL to explain its business model and that conversations have been productive. More generally, Osborne said that Scale AI brings more \u201cflexible work opportunities in AI\u201d to Americans than any other company and that feedback from its contributors is \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of thousands of people use our platform to showcase their skills and earn extra money,\u201d Osborne said.\nScale AI is indeed a popular gig work platform. But it has recently faced legal challenges from some ex-workers over its labor practices. Two lawsuits were filed against the startup \u2014 one in December 2024 and the other in January 2025 \u2014 from former workers alleging they were underpaid and misclassified as contractors instead of employees, denying them access to protections like overtime pay and sick days.\nScale AI has strongly disputed the lawsuits, saying that it fully complies with the law and works to ensure its pay rates meet or surpass local living wage standards.\nScale AI\u2019s international labor practices were also the subject of an investigation by the Washington Post in 2023. Workers overseas described to the Post demanding work at low pay as contractors. The company said at the time that pay rates were continually improving.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s website says it is able to resolve most cases administratively but that employers who violate the law may be subject to fines and potentially imprisonment. The DOL also has the power to force employers to reclassify their workers as employees.\nFor example, in February 2024, hotel staffing startup Qwick settled a DOL case by paying $2.1 million and announcing that all California workers performing work using the Qwick app would be classified as employees, Bloomberg Law reported.\nScale AI also appears to be among the Silicon Valley firms seeking and seeing favor with the new presidential administration. Its CEO and founder Alexandr Wang, for instance, attended Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in January like many other tech CEOs.\nMore telling, Scale AI\u2019s former managing director, Michael Kratsios, is President Trump\u2019s nominee as new director of the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy. Kratsios previously served as the U.S.\u2019s chief technology officer during the first Trump administration.\nIn this position, Kratsios will advise Trump on science and technology matters. This position has no oversight over the Department of Labor. Kratsios was part of a Senate hearing on February 25 but has not been confirmed yet. Kratsios didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nU.S. Department of Labor spokesperson Michael Petersen told TechCrunch that it cannot confirm or deny the existence of any investigation, per long-standing policy.\"\n\nResponse:",
