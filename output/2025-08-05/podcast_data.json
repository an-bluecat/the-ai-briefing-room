Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

This is the first time that OpenAI models will be offered by AWS, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. They will be available as a model choice with Amazon AI services Bedrock and SageMaker AI.\nWhile anyone can download the models via Hugging Face, Amazon is offering these models with OpenAI\u2019s full knowledge and approval, as Dmitry Pimenov, the model maker\u2019s product lead, indicated in the announcement. A spokesperson described the offering as similar to how Amazon offered open model DeepSeek-R1 earlier this year.\nThis is a juicy competitive move for both companies. For AWS, it finally puts the cloud giant in the same sentence as the biggest model maker, OpenAI.\nUntil now, AWS has best been known as a major host and a financial backer of Anthropic\u2019s Claude, one of OpenAI\u2019s biggest competitors. AWS offers Claude, along with other models from makers such as Cohere, DeepSeek, Meta, and Mistral, as well as its own home-grown ones in its AI services. Specifically, Bedrock allows AWS customers to build and host generative AI apps using models of their choice. SageMaker, on the other hand, allows AWS customers to train, or even build, their own AI models largely for analytics uses.\nWhile AWS\u2019s ultimate rival, Microsoft, hasn\u2019t had a lock on OpenAI models since January, Azure is still OpenAI\u2019s most significant cloud partner to date. OpenAI even announced that Microsoft is offering versions of these two new models, too, optimized for Windows devices.\nWatching Microsoft win an increasing amount of cloud business with OpenAI has been a public pain in Amazon CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s neck. Just last week during Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings call, Jassy was pounded with questions from Wall Street analysts about how the company was losing ground in AI to competitors, particularly Microsoft.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nFor instance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth asked Jassy to explain \u201csignificantly faster cloud growth among the number two and number three players in the space,\u201d referring to Microsoft and Google. Later, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak told Jassy that Wall Street thinks \u201cAWS is falling behind in GenAI with concerns about share loss, peers, etc.\u201d\nJassy responded with a minutes-long diatribe that included this barb at Redmond: \u201cI think the second player is about 65% of the size of the AWS.\u201d\nMeanwhile, another AWS competitor, Oracle, reported that it signed a $30 billion a year deal with OpenAI to offer data center services. This means that OpenAI plans to pay Oracle more each year than all of its other cloud services customers combined. Until now, AWS had been left out of any OpenAI-related glory.\nAs for how such a move with AWS benefits OpenAI: The AI provider\u2019s relationship with Microsoft is notoriously strained, as the two are reportedly renegotiating their long-term partnership deal. What better way for OpenAI to strengthen its position than to cozy up the biggest cloud provider, even if, initially, on a small scale?\nIn addition, this partnership allows swaths of AWS enterprise customers to easily experiment with using OpenAI models with their hosted AI apps.\nMeanwhile Altman gets to undercut Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg with this move as well. As OpenAI releases these two high-performing models under an Apache 2.0 open source license, Meta recently admitted that it probably won\u2019t continue to open source all of its upcoming \u201csuperintelligence\u201d models.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI launches two 'open' AI reasoning models\ndescription1:\nOpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of two open-weight AI reasoning models with similar capabilities to its o-series. Both are freely available to download from the online developer platform Hugging Face, the company said, describing the models as \u201cstate of the art\u201d when measured across several benchmarks for comparing open models.\nThe models come in two sizes: a larger and more capable gpt-oss-120b model that can run on a single Nvidia GPU, and a lighter-weight gpt-oss-20b model that can run on a consumer laptop with 16GB of memory.\nThe launch marks OpenAI\u2019s first \u2018open\u2019 language model since GPT-2, which was released more than five years ago.\nIn a briefing, OpenAI said its open models will be capable of sending complex queries to AI models in the cloud, as TechCrunch previously reported. That means if OpenAI\u2019s open model is not capable of a certain task, such as processing an image, developers can connect the open model to one of the company\u2019s more capable closed models.\nWhile OpenAI open sourced AI models in its early days, the company has generally favored a proprietary, closed source development approach. The latter strategy has helped OpenAI build a large business selling access to its AI models via an API to enterprises and developers.\nHowever, CEO Sam Altman said in January he believes OpenAI has been \u201con the wrong side of history\u201d when it comes to open sourcing its technologies. The company today faces growing pressure from Chinese AI labs \u2014 including DeepSeek, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen, and Moonshot AI \u2014 which have developed several of the world\u2019s most capable and popular open models. (While Meta previously dominated the open AI space, the company\u2019s Llama AI models have fallen behind in the last year.)\nIn July, the Trump administration also urged U.S. AI developers to open source more technology to promote global adoption of AI aligned with American values.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWith the release of gpt-oss, OpenAI hopes to curry favor with developers and the Trump administration alike, both of which have watched the Chinese AI labs rise to prominence in the open source space.\n\u201cGoing back to when we started in 2015, OpenAI\u2019s mission is to ensure AGI that benefits all of humanity,\u201d said Altman in a statement shared with TechCrunch. \u201cTo that end, we are excited for the world to be building on an open AI stack created in the United States, based on democratic values, available for free to all and for wide benefit.\u201d\nImage Credits:Tomohiro Ohsumi / Getty Images\nHow the models performed\nOpenAI aimed to make its open model a leader among other open-weight AI models, and the company claims to have done just that.\nOn Codeforces (with tools), a competitive coding test, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b score 2622 and 2516, respectively, outperforming DeepSeek\u2019s R1 while underperforming o3 and o4-mini.\nOpenAI\u2019s open model performance on codeforces. Image Credits:OpenAI\nOn Humanity\u2019s Last Exam (HLE), a challenging test of crowdsourced questions across a variety of subjects (with tools), gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b score 19% and 17.3%, respectively. Similarly, this underperforms o3 but outperforms leading open models from DeepSeek and Qwen.\nOpenAI\u2019s open model performance on HLE. Image Credits:OpenAI\nNotably, OpenAI\u2019s open models hallucinate significantly more than its latest AI reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini.\nHallucinations have been getting more severe in OpenAI\u2019s latest AI reasoning models, and the company previously said it doesn\u2019t quite understand why. In a white paper, OpenAI says this is \u201cexpected, as smaller models have less world knowledge than larger frontier models and tend to hallucinate more.\u201d\nOpenAI found that gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b hallucinated in response to 49% and 53%, respectively, of questions on PersonQA, the company\u2019s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model\u2019s knowledge about people. That\u2019s more than triple the hallucination rate of OpenAI\u2019s o1 model, which scored 16%, and higher than its o4-mini model, which scored 36%.\nTraining the new models\nOpenAI says its open models were trained with similar processes to its proprietary models. The company says each open model leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) to tap fewer parameters for any given question, making it run more efficiently. For gpt-oss-120b, which has 117 billion total parameters, OpenAI says the model only activates 5.1 billion parameters per token.\nThe company also says its open model was trained using high-compute reinforcement learning (RL) \u2014 a post-training process to teach AI models right from wrong in simulated environments using large clusters of Nvidia GPUs. This was also used to train OpenAI\u2019s o-series of models, and the open models have a similar chain-of-thought process in which they take additional time and computational resources to work through their answers.\nAs a result of the post-training process, OpenAI says its open AI models excel at powering AI agents and are capable of calling tools such as web search or Python code execution as part of its chain-of-thought process. However, OpenAI says its open models are text-only, meaning they will not be able to process or generate images and audio like the company\u2019s other models.\nOpenAI is releasing gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b under the Apache 2.0 license, which is generally considered one of the most permissive. This license will allow enterprises to monetize OpenAI\u2019s open models without having to pay or obtain permission from the company.\nHowever, unlike fully open source offerings from AI labs like AI2, OpenAI says it will not be releasing the training data used to create its open models. This decision is not surprising given that several active lawsuits against AI model providers, including OpenAI, have alleged that these companies inappropriately trained their AI models on copyrighted works.\nOpenAI delayed the release of its open models several times in recent months, partially to address safety concerns. Beyond the company\u2019s typical safety policies, OpenAI says in a white paper that it also investigated whether bad actors could fine-tune its gpt-oss models to be more helpful in cyberattacks or the creation of biological or chemical weapons.\nAfter testing from OpenAI and third-party evaluators, the company says gpt-oss may marginally increase biological capabilities. However, it did not find evidence that these open models could reach its \u201chigh capability\u201d threshold for danger in these domains, even after fine-tuning.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s model appears to be state-of-the-art among open models, developers are eagerly awaiting the release of DeepSeek R2, its next AI reasoning model, as well as a new open model from Meta\u2019s Superintelligence Lab.\n\ntitle2:\nUS adds OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to list of approved AI vendors for federal agencies\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nThe U.S. government has added Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic to a list of approved vendors that can offer artificial intelligence services to civilian federal agencies, Bloomberg reports.\nThe companies will see their AI tools offered via a new federal contracting platform, the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS), which would let government agencies access AI tool vendors with pre-negotiated contracts, rather than negotiating with vendors individually.\nBloomberg reports that the General Services Administration (GSA), which is in charge of the MAS, said the tech companies were assessed on the grounds of security and performance.\nThe news comes in the wake of executive orders by President Donald Trump focused on AI development, including the adjustment of environmental standards to boost the supply of energy for data centers, as well as a directive for federal agencies to only use AI that\u2019s \u201cfree from ideological bias.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nThe EU AI Act aims to create a level playing field for AI innovation: Here's what it is\ndescription3:\nThe European Union\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act, known as the EU AI Act, has been described by the European Commission as \u201cthe world\u2019s first comprehensive AI law.\u201d After years in the making, it is progressively becoming a part of reality for the 450 million people living in the 27 countries that comprise the EU.\nThe EU AI Act, however, is more than a European affair. It applies to companies both local and foreign, and it can affect both providers and deployers of AI systems; the European Commission cites examples of how it would apply to a developer of a CV screening tool and to a bank that buys that tool. Now all of these parties have a legal framework that sets the stage for their use of AI.\nWhy does the EU AI Act exist?\nAs usual with EU legislation, the EU AI Act exists to make sure there is a uniform legal framework applying to a certain topic across EU countries \u2014 the topic this time being AI. Now that the regulation is in place, it should \u201censure the free movement, cross-border, of AI-based goods and services\u201d without diverging local restrictions.\nWith timely regulation, the EU seeks to create a level playing field across the region and foster trust, which could also create opportunities for emerging companies. However, the common framework that it has adopted is not exactly permissive: Despite the relatively early stage of widespread AI adoption in most sectors, the EU AI Act sets a high bar for what AI should and shouldn\u2019t do for society more broadly.\nWhat is the purpose of the EU AI Act?\nAccording to European lawmakers, the framework\u2019s main goal is to \u201cpromote the uptake of human centric and trustworthy AI while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, to protect against the harmful effects of AI systems in the Union, and to support innovation.\u201d\nYes, that\u2019s quite a mouthful, but it\u2019s worth parsing carefully. First, because a lot will depend on how you define \u201chuman centric\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy\u201d AI. And second, because it gives a good sense of the precarious balance to maintain between diverging goals: innovation vs. harm prevention, as well as uptake of AI vs. environmental protection. As usual with EU legislation, again, the devil will be in the details.\nHow does the EU AI Act balance its different goals?\nTo balance harm prevention against the potential benefits of AI, the EU AI Act adopted a risk-based approach: banning a handful of \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d use cases; flagging a set of \u201chigh-risk\u201d uses calling for tight regulation; and applying lighter obligations to \u201climited risk\u201d scenarios.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nHas the EU AI Act come into effect?\nYes and no. The EU AI Act rollout started on August 1, 2024, but it will only come into force through a series of staggered compliance deadlines. In most cases, it will also apply sooner to new entrants than to companies that already offer AI products and services in the EU.\nThe first deadline came into effect on February 2, 2025, and focused on enforcing bans on a small number of prohibited uses of AI, such as untargeted scraping of internet or CCTV for facial images to build up or expand databases. Many others will follow, but unless the schedule changes, most provisions will apply by mid-2026.\nWhat changed on August 2, 2025?\nSince August 2, 2025, the EU AI Act applies to \u201cgeneral-purpose AI models with systemic risk.\u201d\nGPAI (general-purpose AI) models are AI models trained with a large amount of data, and that can be used for a wide range of tasks. That\u2019s where the risk element comes in. According to the EU AI Act, GPAI models can come with systemic risks \u2014 \u201cfor example, through the lowering of barriers for chemical or biological weapons development, or unintended issues of control over autonomous [GPAI] models.\u201d\nAhead of the deadline, the EU published guidelines for providers of GPAI models, which include both European companies and non-European players such as Anthropic, Google, Meta, and OpenAI. But since these companies already have models on the market, they will also have until August 2, 2027, to comply, unlike new entrants.\nDoes the EU AI Act have teeth?\nThe EU AI Act comes with penalties that lawmakers wanted to be simultaneously \u201ceffective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d \u2014 even for large global players.\nDetails will be laid down by EU countries, but the regulation sets out the overall spirit \u2014 that penalties will vary depending on the deemed risk level \u2014 as well as thresholds for each level. Infringement on prohibited AI applications leads to the highest penalty of \u201cup to \u20ac35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher).\u201d\nThe European Commission can also inflict fines of up to \u20ac15 million or 3% of annual turnover on providers of GPAI models.\nHow fast do existing players intend to comply?\nThe voluntary GPAI code of practice, including commitments such as not training models on pirated content, is a good indicator of how companies may engage with the framework law until forced to do so.\nIn July 2025, Meta announced it wouldn\u2019t sign the voluntary GPAI code of practice meant to help such providers comply with the EU AI Act. However, Google soon after confirmed it would sign, despite reservations.\nSignatories so far include Aleph Alpha, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Mistral AI, and OpenAI, among others. But as we have seen with Google\u2019s example, signing does not equal a full-on endorsement.\nWhy have (some) tech companies been fighting these rules?\nWhile stating in a blog post that Google would sign the voluntary GPAI code of practice, its president of global affairs, Kent Walker, still had reservations. \u201cWe remain concerned that the AI Act and Code risk slowing Europe\u2019s development and deployment of AI,\u201d he wrote.\nMeta was more radical, with its chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan stating in a post on LinkedIn that \u201cEurope is heading down the wrong path on AI.\u201d Calling the EU\u2019s implementation of the AI Act \u201coverreach,\u201d he stated that the code of practice \u201cintroduces a number of legal uncertainties for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.\u201d\nEuropean companies have expressed concerns as well. Arthur Mensch, the CEO of French AI champion Mistral AI, was part of a group of European CEOs who signed an open letter in July 2025 urging Brussels to \u201cstop the clock\u201d for two years before key obligations of the EU AI Act came into force.\nWill the schedule change?\nIn early July 2025, the European Union responded negatively to lobbying efforts calling for a pause, saying it would still stick to its timeline for implementing the EU AI Act. It went ahead with the August 2, 2025, deadline as planned, and we will update this story if anything changes.\n\ntitle4:\nLinda Yaccarino joins health tech platform eMed as CEO after leaving X\ndescription4:\nLinda Yaccarino\u2019s next role after departing X as CEO will be another chief executive role at eMed Population Health, an AI startup building a tech platform for patients using GLP-1s.\nYaccarino was a longtime advertising executive at NBCUniversal but left to join X as CEO for two years, where she managed to have a positive impact on the social network\u2019s troubled ad revenue model, despite her and Elon Musk\u2019s shared approach to minimizing content moderation.\nThough Yaccarino does not have experience in health tech, eMed said in a press release that they sought her out for her \u201cundeniable ability to negotiate new partnerships\u201d \u2014 it certainly also helps that her tenure at X made her well-known in the tech world, drawing more eyes toward the startup.\neMed previously produced a tech platform that was designed to be used with at-home COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, guiding users through the process of administering these tests properly.
