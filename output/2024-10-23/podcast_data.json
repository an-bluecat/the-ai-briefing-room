Bloomberg | Getty\nApple on Wednesday released a beta version of a slew of Apple Intelligence features, including its long-awaited ChatGPT integration. The company announced its answer to the artificial intelligence boom this summer, but is slowly rolling out its features to users. Investors hope AI features will spur a wave of iPhone upgrades because the tools are only available on newer devices. Apple Intelligence has been available in previews for developers and early adopters, but the official public release will come next week as part of the official iOS 18.1 release, Apple said. This latest batch of features is included in a beta version of iOS 18.2 for software developers that was released Wednesday. Apple developer betas typically go through a cycle of weeks before they are released to the public. The preview included with iOS 18.2 contains: New abilities to describe how the user wants Apple Intelligence to rewrite a chunk of text.\nGenmoji, Apple's image generator for new emojis.\nImage Playground, Apple's AI image generator.\nImage Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or distractions from photos.\nIntegration with OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, the long-awaited ability for Siri to take actions inside of apps isn't included in this update, but is expected soon.\nAnswers from ChatGPT\nIn June, Apple announced its integration with ChatGPT. Although Apple Intelligence and Siri mostly rely on Apple's chips inside its devices, the company said at the time that for more sophisticated problems or questions, users can get responses from OpenAI's chatbot instead.\nApple Intelligence unveiled during Apple's WWDC2024 in Cupertino, Calif. on June 10th. 2024. Source: Apple Inc.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla is testing a robotaxi service that Elon Musk claims will launch next year\ndescription1:\nElon Musk said he hopes to launch a service that will let people hail self-driving Tesla vehicles in California and Texas sometime in 2025 \u2014 and claims his company has already been testing the service in the Bay Area with employees.\nThe comments, made Wednesday on Tesla\u2019s third-quarter earnings call, go farther than what Musk promised two weeks ago at its Cybercab unveiling event. On that stage, Musk promised that Model 3 and Model Y owners would be able to use an \u201cunsupervised\u201d version of Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving software in California and Texas. But he made no mention of the ride-hailing network, despite Tesla having teased the idea for years.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Tesla would be required to get permission from California\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles to conduct the tests Musk said his company is already performing. The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nDavid Lau, Tesla\u2019s VP of software engineering, said on the call that the cars employees have been hailing have had safety drivers at the wheel. And to be clear, no Tesla vehicles can currently drive themselves without human intervention.\nToday, Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving software, or FSD, is considered an advanced driver assistance system \u2014 not a self-driving system like the one Waymo uses in its robotaxis. FSD offers some automated features that are available on highways and city streets, however the system still requires the driver to pay attention and take control.\nMusk said on the call that Tesla would go through the proper regulatory approval process in California before opening such a service to everyday consumers, though he lamented the red tape and said he expects smoother process in his home state of Texas. The regulatory process in California to launch a commercial robotaxi service has multiple tiers that require approval from the DMV and the California Public Utilities Commission. Waymo is the only company currently allowed to operate a commercial drvierless robotaxi service in San Francisco.\nMusk also opined that Tesla might launch the service in other states by the end of next year, too.\nThese claims come after years of Musk overpromising on Tesla\u2019s ability to develop software that can autonomously drive cars. He originally promised in 2016 in a since-deleted post on Tesla\u2019s website that \u201cAll Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware,\u201d and in the following years made it seem that it would only take the flip of a switch to fill the streets with self-driving cars.\nEven the hardware part of that promise has not borne out.\nTesla has had to upgrade cars with those early version of the so-called \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d hardware. And Musk admitted on Wednesday\u2019s call that cars equipped with what Tesla calls \u201cHardware 3\u201d \u2014 which it started building into its EVs in 2019 \u2014 may not ultimately be able to drive themselves. If Tesla does someday get to the point where its software can drive vehicles without supervision, and it doesn\u2019t work on Hardware 3, Musk promised to swap out that hardware at no cost to owners.\n\ntitle2:\nCharacter.AI and Google sued after chatbot-obsessed teen\u2019s death\ndescription2:\nA lawsuit has been filed against Character.AI, its founders Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas, and Google in the wake of a teenager\u2019s death, alleging wrongful death, negligence, deceptive trade practices, and product liability. Filed by the teen\u2019s mother, Megan Garcia, it claims the platform for custom AI chatbots was \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d and lacked safety guardrails while being marketed to children.\nAs outlined in the lawsuit, 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III began using Character.AI last year, interacting with chatbots modeled after characters from The Game of Thrones, including Daenerys Targaryen. Setzer, who chatted with the bots continuously in the months before his death, died by suicide on February 28th, 2024, \u201cseconds\u201d after his last interaction with the bot.\nAccusations include the site \u201canthropomorphizing\u201d AI characters and that the platform\u2019s chatbots offer \u201cpsychotherapy without a license.\u201d Character.AI houses mental health-focused chatbots like \u201cTherapist\u201d and \u201cAre You Feeling Lonely,\u201d which Setzer interacted with.\nRelated The teens making friends with AI chatbots\nGarcia\u2019s lawyers quote Shazeer saying in an interview that he and De Freitas left Google to start his own company because \u201cthere\u2019s just too much brand risk in large companies to ever launch anything fun\u201d and that he wanted to \u201cmaximally accelerate\u201d the tech. It says they left after the company decided against launching the Meena LLM they\u2019d built. Google acquired the Character.AI leadership team in August.\nCharacter.AI\u2019s website and mobile app has hundreds of custom AI chatbots, many modeled after popular characters from TV shows, movies, and video games. A few months ago, The Verge wrote about the millions of young people, including teens, who make up the bulk of its user base, interacting with bots that might pretend to be Harry Styles or a therapist. Another recent report from Wired highlighted issues with Character.AI\u2019s custom chatbots impersonating real people without their consent, including one posing as a teen who was murdered in 2006.\nBecause of the way chatbots like Character.ai generate output that depends on what the user inputs, they fall into an uncanny valley of thorny questions about user-generated content and liability that, so far, lacks clear answers.\nCharacter.AI has now announced several changes to the platform, with communications head Chelsea Harrison saying in an email to The Verge, \u201cWe are heartbroken by the tragic loss of one of our users and want to express our deepest condolences to the family.\u201d\nSome of the changes include:\nChanges to our models for minors (under the age of 18) that are designed to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content.\nImproved detection, response, and intervention related to user inputs that violate our Terms or Community Guidelines.\nA revised disclaimer on every chat to remind users that the AI is not a real person.\nNotification when a user has spent an hour-long session on the platform with additional user flexibility in progress.\n\ntitle3:\nX's India revenue falls 90%, filing shows\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nX revenue in India plummeted 89.8% to $2.51 million in the financial year ending March, according to regulatory filings from the Elon Musk-owned social network.\nThe company, which had posted revenue of $24.7 million in the previous fiscal year, also significantly reduced its expenses in India to $2.2 million from $20 million year-over-year, the filing revealed.\nDespite the dramatic revenue drop, the India unit managed to report a profit of $380,000 for the fiscal year ending March, down from $3.62 million in the prior year.\nMusk previously identified India as a key market for Twitter. In an earlier lawsuit Musk had filed against Twitter, he said he believed India was the company\u2019s third-largest market.\nIt remains unclear why X\u2019s revenue declined so dramatically in the country, but it coincides with widespread local and global layoffs. The downturn also mirrors the platform\u2019s global struggles to retain advertisers.\nX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nArm reportedly cancels Qualcomm design license\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nIn a move that could profoundly affect an already beleaguered global supply chain, Arm has reportedly issued Qualcomm a 60-day notice of cancelation for chip design licensing. The move, reported by Bloomberg, would have an impact on a majority of smartphone manufacturers that rely on Qualcomm chips.\nU.K.-based Arm, which licenses chip architecture, issued the notice as part of a protracted battle with the Snapdragon producer. Much of the issue can be traced back to a dispute over contracts and trademarks that found Arm suing Qualcomm. Qualcomm returned with its own suit.\nA spokesperson for the San Diego chipmaker told Bloomberg that the notice \u201cappears to be an attempt to disrupt the legal process, and its claim for termination is completely baseless.\u201d\nUpdate: A spokesperson for Qualcomm tells TechCrunch, \u201cThis is more of the same from Aem \u2013 more unfounded threats designed to strongarm a longtime partner, interfere with our performance-leading CPUs, and increase royalty rates regardless of the broad rights under our architecture license. With a trial fast approaching in December, Arm\u2019s desperate ploy appears to be an attempt to disrupt the legal process, and its claim for termination is completely baseless. We are confident that Qualcomm\u2019s rights under its agreement with Arm will be affirmed. Arm\u2019s anticompetitive conduct will not be tolerated.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
