Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday May 6), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nWaymo ramps up robotaxi production at new Arizona factory\ndescription0:\nWaymo has played coy for years about exactly how many Jaguar I-Pace EVs are in its autonomous fleet \u2014 a figure that covers vehicles used in testing and commercial robotaxi operations. On Monday, the Alphabet company finally provided a peek at the commercial side of the fleet.\nWaymo said Monday, as part of a larger announcement, that it has more than 1,500 commercial robotaxis in operation. And work is underway to expand it through a multi-million-dollar investment with Magna to build more than 2,000 autonomous I-Pace vehicles at a new factory in Arizona.\nWaymo has worked with Magna for years, namely at a now closed facility in Detroit. The new 239,000-square-foot factory in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa is strategically located in the one of Waymo\u2019s robotaxi markets and close to its other service areas across San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.\nA Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch the company looked at other locations, but ultimately it chose Mesa for its proximity to other markets and because the consistent weather made it ideal for the validation process required before the robotaxis can be used by the public.\nWaymo said in a blog post announcing the factory that it received final delivery from Jaguar earlier this year. From here, contract builder Magna and Waymo take over to integrate the self-driving system into the vehicles. Waymo emphasized a new process designed to speed up the production-to-validation-to-public use process, noting that the AVs can drive themselves out of the facility and directly into service.\n\u201cIn fact, these vehicles can pick up their first public passengers less than 30 minutes after leaving the factory,\u201d Waymo said in its blog post. The company said that vehicles intended for other cities can be deployed into public service in a matter of hours after being shipped to their local depot.\nThe Mesa factory is designed to handle other vehicle platforms, notably to integrate the sixth-generation of Waymo\u2019s self-driving system into the Zeekr RT later this year.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nThe plant will introduce an automated assembly line and other efficiencies over time, according to the company, which noted that the plant will be capable of building tens of thousands of fully autonomous Waymo vehicles per year when operating at full capacity.\n\ntitle1:\nUber and WeRide set their robotaxi sights on 15 more cities\ndescription1:\nUber and Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide plan to expand a commercial robotaxi partnership and bring the service to another 15 cities over the next five years. The expansion comes five months after the two companies launched a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi.\nThe companies said the expansion will include cities in Europe. Under the partnership, WeRide\u2019s robotaxi services are available through the Uber app. The relationship is similar to Uber\u2019s deal with Waymo, in which the ride-hailing company handles the network routing and fleet operations, while the autonomous vehicle company remains responsible for the AV tech.\nUber and WeRide, which went public on the Nasdaq in late October, operate together in Abu Dhabi and announced plans to add Dubai. In Abu Dhabi, they work with local Tawasul Transport to handle fleet operations.\nThe additional 15 cities will focus on cities outside of China and United States.\nUber has locked up more than 15 partnerships with a wide-range of autonomous vehicle technology companies over the past two years across ride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. In the past two months, Uber has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility Volkswagen, and Chinese self-driving firm Momenta.\nIt\u2019s most high-profile partnership in the U.S. \u2014 and one that is commercially operating today \u2014 is with Waymo. The companies offer a Waymo on Uber service in Austin and are about to do the same in Atlanta.\n\ntitle2:\nA stealth AI model beat DALL-E and Midjourney on a popular benchmark - its creator just landed $30M\ndescription2:\nRecraft, the startup behind a mysterious image model that beat OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E and Midjourney on a respected industry benchmark last year, has raised a $30 million Series B round led by Accel, it exclusively told TechCrunch.\nOther investors in the round include Khosla Ventures and Madrona. Based in San Francisco, Recraft previously raised a $12 million Series A led by Khosla in 2024. The San Francisco-based startup says it recently passed $5 million in ARR and 4 million users.\nThe startup caught industry attention when its model, codenamed \u201cred_panda,\u201d topped the Artificial Analysis benchmark last year. This was actually Recraft\u2019s V3, which earned its name because early users kept generating images of the cute mammal, Recraft\u2019s founder and CEO Anna Veronika Dorogush told TechCrunch.\nRecraft says it builds its own models from scratch and competes with other image generators like Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, Stable Diffusion, and Black Forest Labs, Dorogush said. But Recraft\u2019s AI particularly excels at generating images for brands. That means allowing them to place logos exactly where needed without extra editing, or easily generating new marketing materials like brochures and posters that comply with existing branding guidelines.\nIt\u2019s an area where existing image models often fall short, according to Dorogush. That puts Recraft closer to competing with design tools like Canva, which also has an AI generator for branding purposes.\nRecraft is also notable for having a solo female founder and CEO. Dorogush founded Recraft after years of working on machine learning at Yandex \u2014 the Russian Google competitor \u2014 along with prior stints at Google and Microsoft.\nBefore building AI models, Dorogush worked as a professional model while she earned a math and computer science degree at one of Russia\u2019s top universities. She ended up leaving that line of work but says it taught her that simply working hard \u2014 like showing up to endless casting calls \u2014 wasn\u2019t enough.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\n\u201cThe biggest lesson from that time was that grinding isn\u2019t everything,\u201d Dorogush said. \u201cNow when building a company, I know that to succeed, we have to be excellent at what\u2019s mission-critical. In our case, building models is very important. So we have put all the effort into excelling at this.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nOver 250 CEOs sign open letter supporting K-12 AI and computer science education\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nMore than 250 CEOs signed an open letter published in The New York Times on Monday calling for AI and computer science to be \u201ccore components\u201d of K-12 curricula.\nThe signatories, which include Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Etsy CEO Josh Silverman, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, argue that computer science and AI education are essential to \u201ckeeping America competitive.\u201d\n\u201cCountries like Brazil, China, [South] Korea, and Singapore have already made computer science or AI mandatory for every student,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThe United States is falling behind. In the age of AI, we must prepare our children for the future \u2014 to be AI creators, not just consumers.\u201d\nThe letter arrives as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration works to shape a new U.S. AI policy \u2014 and as deep cuts to federal programs risk harming fundamental AI research. Last week, Trump issued an executive order to promote the integration of AI in K-12, higher education, and workplaces through partnerships between industry and academia.\n\ntitle4:\nMusk clashes with neighbors in exclusive Austin suburb\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nElon Musk may have a sizable fan base, but residents of the upscale Austin suburb of West Lake Hills, Texas, are unimpressed by their celebrity neighbor, reports the New York Times. Instead, a $6 million home Musk purchased in 2022 has become the center of a battle after his team erected an unauthorized 16-foot chain-link fence, installed a metal gate, and mounted outward-facing cameras.\n\u201cI call that place Fort Knox,\u201d says Paul Hemmer, a Tesla owner and retired real estate agent who lives across the street and serves as president of the neighborhood homeowners association.\nMusk\u2019s security personnel, many visibly armed, and their vehicles have disrupted the tranquil street, and the prospect of his return from Washington has some worried over more than Musk\u2019s failure to obtain construction permits. \u201cIf you follow him at all in the news, he\u2019s always guilty of building stuff and then asking for permission later,\u201d Hemmer complained in a planning meeting.\nFor Hemmer, the billionaire\u2019s proximity may come at the steepest price. Per the Times, Musk\u2019s security team once reported him to police, claiming he was naked in the street. Hemmer, who has flown drones over Musk\u2019s house looking for ordinance violations, countered he was on his own property in his underwear.\"\n\nResponse:",
