Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

(The milestone was confirmed by SpaceX on Thursday.)\nThe milestone would mean that SpaceX has gained a million new customers since the end of May alone. This outpaces the company\u2019s already impressive rate of growth: Starlink started providing beta service of its product in October 2020; it hit 1 million subscribers in December 2022, 2 million subscribers in September 2023, and 3 million in May. The constellation now comprises nearly 6,000 satellites, with service available in nearly 100 countries to individual users as well as large enterprise customers like major airlines and cruise lines.\nThe service is on track to generate $6.6 billion in revenue this year \u2014 an increase from roughly $1.4 billion just two years prior, according to industry research and consulting firm Quilty Space.\nStarlink is central to SpaceX\u2019s overall plan to commercialize and eventually explore space. While the company has continued to raise money from investors, CEO Elon Musk has said for years that revenue from the broadband internet service would help fund further development of the massive reusable rocket, Starship. In turn, bringing Starship online will help the company launch even more Starlink satellites at a greater cadence.\nStarlink has become the undisputed giant of satellite internet. Since starting service, it has taken increased market share from legacy incumbents like Viasat and SES, which operate large satellites in a higher geostationary orbit. There are a handful of other constellations currently in the works, notably Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper, but they have yet to commence commercial service.\n\ntitle1:\nFormer Brex COO who now heads unicorn fintech Figure says GPT is already upending the mortgage industry\ndescription1:\nLending startup Figure announced today a rollout of AI tooling to make the home lending process more efficient. The company will be launching an AI tool powered by GPT-4 to help catch errors in lending documents.\nFigure, founded in 2018, specializes in helping consumers secure home equity lines of credit. The company touts that its all-online process condenses a normally 45-day process to five. More than half of Figure\u2019s business is B2B, where it\u2019s embedded in companies like solar panel loan company GoodLeap.\nThe company, which has raised over $1.5 billion and was last valued at around $3 billion, according to PitchBook, is now making a push into AI \u2014 a strategy heralded by new CEO Michael Tannenbaum, who left his station as COO at Brex to join the firm. \u201cI thought that this was something that could really transform the way that fintech businesses work,\u201d he said of his move.\nThe key AI product he\u2019s pushed for is to help with \u201cstare and compare\u201d instances in the lending process. He gave the example of a property-level description, which is a unique description of the asset that has to be exactly the same on many of the legal documents. Traditionally, a human would have to look through over 60 pages to ensure the description is the same. Tannenbaum said their new feature massively decreases the manual labor and time it takes to verify the documents. It\u2019s an example, he said, of AI \u201ctaking costs out of complex processes.\u201d\nGiven the personal information in loan applications, the company had to go back and forth with OpenAI to make sure their privacy agreement was ironclad and \u201cthat the models were not being trained on our customer data in a certain way,\u201d he said.\nAlthough the feature runs on GPT-4, Ruben Padron, chief data officer, emphasized that the company made it a priority to build model-agnostic systems. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly testing and evaluating different models as they come out, and almost weekly, or sometimes daily,\u201d he said. Their systems \u201coffer us a lot of flexibility to allow us to quickly and dynamically pivot to whatever vendor is offering the highest performance.\u201d\nPadron sees many more AI offerings in Figure\u2019s future, emphasizing that the more they can automate the lending application process, the less chance for error or bias. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to lower the cost, eliminate the manual work, reduce the bias,\u201d Padron said. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a journey. It\u2019s not a destination.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nRunway earmarks $5M to fund up to 100 films using AI-generated video\ndescription2:\nAI video generators need to believe that filmmakers will use their models in the production process. Otherwise why exist?\nTo jump-start the new AI film ecosystem, Runway has set aside $5 million in cash and more in service credits to fund up to 100 original films. If you\u2019re an AI-curious director, now\u2019s your chance to get a little backing.\nRunway\u2019s Hundred Film Fund is intended to help kick-start any video-based project that uses the company\u2019s generative video model in some way. \u201cTraditional funding mechanisms often overlook new and emerging visions within the larger industry ecosystem,\u201d the company wrote in the blog post.\nSpecifically, Runway is dedicating $5 million of its own money to award as grants to filmmakers creating \u201cfeatures, shorts, documentaries, experimental projects, music videos,\u201d or some as-yet-unknown format. The awards would also come with up to $2 million in Runway credits.\nThe announcement post does say that the cash side has \u201cthe potential to grow to $10M.\u201d I asked what this means, and Runway Head of Creative Jamie Umpherson said they want to be \u201cas flexible as possible in how we\u2019re approaching the scope of this fund. We are starting with one hundred films but we hope to do more over time.\u201d\nAs for how $5 million can be equitably and effectively divided 100 ways, when up to $1 million grants are being dangled as possibilities, Umpherson evaded, simply saying that \u201ceach project will be assessed on its own particular production needs when it comes to grant considerations.\u201d (You can read the fine print and apply here.) If you\u2019ve got some clout, you might want to gun for one of five \u201cdirector residency\u201d positions. It\u2019s unclear what the requirements or benefits are here, but it can\u2019t hurt to try.\nThe good news is that Runway will not itself assert any form of ownership or control over the projects, only requiring that awardees send biweekly production updates and that Runway is allowed to showcase the final result as it sees fit. They will have advisors, like Tribeca film festival co-founder Jane Rosenthal, and will.i.am, who will help select the awardees and maybe even offer some extra support.\nThe film fund does have an air of \u201cplease use our product,\u201d though there\u2019s truth to the assertion that newer, experimental tools are sometimes shunned by more traditional production companies. Sometimes it really does just take a little cash infusion to find that one breakthrough use of a technology, by someone who might not have been able to find funding otherwise.\nThere is also a legitimate worry that the results will be very uneven. As industry veteran Michael Black put it recently in a discussion of AI tools in filmmaking: \u201cYou can give somebody a powerful car, that doesn\u2019t make them a Formula One driver, right? That\u2019s a little bit like what we have now. Maybe some new voice will have an opportunity that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise. But the number of people making really good films is still going to be small.\u201d\nIn light of that, it is perhaps actually the wisest move to cast the net widely and fund as many as possible. \u201cSpray and pray\u201d is an unkind way to put it, but fundamentally accurate: The hope is that among the 100 films, at least one or two will show that AI-generated video is actually useful and perhaps even groundbreaking.\nNo doubt some filmmakers will take the shot just to put a couple bucks in the bank, and find a way to fob off Runway with a dream sequence or the like. But if a few dozen creators take the money and take the tech seriously, that\u2019s probably a win in the startup\u2019s books.\n\ntitle3:\nSuper Micro shares tumble 12% after DOJ reportedly opens probe into company\ndescription3:\nSuper Micro Computer shares closed down 12% on Thursday after the Justice Department reportedly opened a probe into the company, which has been a major beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom.\nThe probe is in its early days, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, and it comes after Hindenburg Research disclosed a short position in the company in late August. Hindenburg said it identified \"fresh evidence of accounting manipulation,\" according to its report. CNBC could not independently verify Hindenburg's claims.\nSuper Micro makes computers that companies use as servers for websites, data storage and other applications, including AI algorithms. The company's customers include major players in AI such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel.\nA prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco has asked for information about a former employee who has previously accused Super Micro of accounting violations, according to the Journal.\nFollowing Hindenburg's report in August, Super Micro said it would not file its annual report for the fiscal year with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on time, sending shares tumbling nearly 20%. It is not clear if the delay was related to the firm's report.\nSuper Micro and the Department of Justice declined to comment. Hindenburg did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta Connect 2024: Orion glasses, Quest 3S headset, Meta AI upgrades, Ray-Ban Meta real-time video, and more\ndescription4:\nMeta Connect 2024 is a developer-centric event featuring a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He showcased new hardware and software to support two of Meta\u2019s big ambitions: AI and the metaverse. This included everything from new Quest headsets, updates to Meta\u2019s Llama AI model, and even a new fully AR glasses prototype.\nMeta Connect 2024 kicked off live at 10 a.m. PT Wednesday, September 25. You can watch the archive via Meta Connect\u2019s site, on Meta\u2019s developer Facebook page, and you can still dive into Horizon Worlds from your Meta Quest headset if you really want to feel the full immersion.\nWe\u2019ll be compiling all of the announcements and reveals out of Meta Connect 2024 below and will keep it updated throughout the event and after as more reactions and analysis arrive.\nMeta reveals Orion, \u201cthe most advanced glasses the world has ever seen\u201d\nImage Credits: Meta\nIn a surprise announcement, Zuckerberg dramatically revealed Orion, which Meta says will eventually become the company\u2019s \u201cfirst consumer full holographic AR glasses,\u201d though they won\u2019t be arriving on any consumers\u2019 faces anytime soon. Touting Orion\u2019s light weight, compatibility for hand-tracking and eye-tracking, and most ambitiously, a neural interface, Zuckerberg also touted some impressed, and famous, early testers (including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). The Orion glasses were presented as the future of Meta\u2019s AR efforts, with our own ongoing coverage of Meta Connect\u2019s final big reveal here.\nWe see that TechCrunch logo, Meta \ud83d\udc40 Image Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s Quest 3S headset launches for $299\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s reveal of the Quest 3S was indicated by several pre-event leaks and confirmed during Connect 2024. The Meta Quest 3S comes as a less expensive alternative to the Quest 3, starting at $299 for a 128GB version and 256GB for $399. The entirely wireless headset is compatible with the existing library of Quest apps and games, though Meta was particularly enthusiastic about its mixed-reality features. With the reveal of the Quest 3S, the Quest 3 will drop from $649 to $499. Get our early impressions of the new Quest 3S here ahead of its October 15 ship date.\nMeta announces the Meta Quest 3S at #MetaConnect2024.\nWith a $300 starting price, the Meta Quest 3S is $200 less expensive than the Quest 3. pic.twitter.com/2FTizJvAj5 \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 25, 2024\nQuest 2, Quest Pro discontinued\n\u201cWith Quest 3S on the shelf, we\u2019re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We\u2019ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they\u2019re gone, whichever comes first,\u201d Meta told TechCrunch about the discontinuation of two of their headsets in the wake of the Quest 3S announcement.\nMeta AI gets vocal\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta AI is finding its voice. Users can ask a question or otherwise chat with Meta AI out loud through Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram and get simulated vocal responses in return. The digital voice assistant will roll out with multiple voice options to choose from, including the AI voices of celebrities like Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Awkwafina, Kristen Bell, and Keegan-Michael Key.\nThe reveal comes a day after OpenAI announced the long-awaited rollout of its Advanced Voice Mode feature, with a new look and five new voices. And speaking of vocal announcements, Zuckerberg touted that Meta AI now has 500 million users.\nAnnounced at #MetaConnect2024, Meta AI's new celebrity voices let you ask questions to AI versions of Dame Judi Dench, Awkwafina, Keegan-Michael Key, John Cenna, and Kristen Bell. pic.twitter.com/LtlCDeFc8c \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 25, 2024\nMeta\u2019s Llama 3.2 AI model released\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s multilingual Llama family of models has reached version 3.2, signifying that several Llama models are now multimodal. Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can interpret charts and graphs, caption images, and pinpoint objects in pictures given a simple description.\nLlama 3.2 11B and 90B might be able to look at a map of a park and tell you how long a certain path is, or when the terrain could become steeper. Or, provided a graph showing a company\u2019s revenue over the course of a year, the models can quickly spotlight the best-performing months of the bunch.\nNotably, Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can\u2019t be accessed in Europe due to the EU\u2019s Act restrictions. As a result, several Meta AI features available elsewhere, like image analysis, are disabled for European users.\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta sunglasses get real-time AI video and reminders\nImage Credits: Meta\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses are getting upgrades as the company continues to try and make the case that the smart glasses can become the next big consumer device. At the forefront of the pitch is the addition of real-time AI video processing, which lets you to ask the Ray-Ban Meta glasses questions about what it can see in front of you.\nThe sunglasses will also be getting a smartphone-like reminder feature; live language translation between English and French, Italian, or Spanish; and full integration with music streaming apps like Amazon Music, Audible, and iHeart Radio.\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses will have real-time AI video processing, allowing you to ask questions about what the glasses can see. pic.twitter.com/KO0LlMvT3y \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 25, 2024\nYes, we know what Zuckerberg\u2019s shirt says\nScreenshot Image Credits: Meta /\nZuckerberg\u2019s evolution into a self-made fashionista was on full display during Meta Connect, with a shirt that spelled out: \u201cAct Zuck aut nihil,\u201d which for those not well versed in Latin, translates to \u201ceither Zuck or nothing.\u201d The phrase is originally associated with Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, further cementing Zuckerberg as a Rome Guy.\nMeta AI explores visual search\nImage Credits: Meta\nIn a feature that will be familiar to anyone following OpenAI, Google, and Apple\u2019s application of image-based searches, Meta showcased its AI\u2019s capacity to respond to prompts based on images, as well as edit photos provided to the AI based on feedback given by the user. It can also share them to Instagram Stories.\nMore AI in your Facebook feeds\nImage Credits: Meta\nIf you\u2019re on Facebook, you\u2019ve probably seen a lot of AI recently, knowingly or unknowingly. There\u2019s an entire nascent industry around using it to generate engagement bait. Earlier this month, the label noting whether content has been edited using Meta\u2019s tools was shrunk down. And now Facebook will actually pitch you on AI content that it generates for you that it thinks you\u2019ll want to share or engage with.\nTests for translated, dubbed content from creators\nImage Credits: Meta\nGoing a step beyond just translating captions, Meta announced a test that would use its AI translation tools to take creator content, create a translated dub, and sync the creator\u2019s lips accordingly. So far, the experiment is limited to creator videos made in the U.S. and Latin America, with translations between English and Spanish.\nMeta demonstrates a test of its AI translation tools for creator content that dubs and syncs the creator\u2019s lips. pic.twitter.com/ziHyX1H65i \u2014 TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) September 25, 2024\nIn what ended up being a surreal moment, Zuckerberg brought on creator Don Allen Stevenson III for a conversation on the stage, which then turned into a demo during which Zuckerberg interviewed an AI version of Stevenson while the real deal was right beside him.\nImage Credits: Meta\nMeta\u2019s new VR pitch for mobile devs\nAmid the big AI reveals and hardware and announcements, Meta did dive into the broader purpose of Connect \u2014 building ties with its community of developers. As it continues to pitch developers on helping build out the Quest app store\u2019s offerings, Meta released new support for Android apps on the Quest, along with support for 3D and spatial apps.\nBatman, Wordle, and the rest of the games announcements\nA number of new experiences were revealed for the Quest ecosystem at Meta Connect 2024, led by Batman: Arkham Shadow, which launches October 22 and will also be bundled with new Quest 3 and 3S purchases until April of next year.
