The cuts come just a month after Meta hired Scale AI\u2019s CEO in a $14.3 billion deal.\nIn a memo obtained by Bloomberg, interim CEO Jason Droege told staff that Scale AI had too quickly scaled its core data-labeling business \u2014 in which the startup supplied AI labs with labeled, structured data to train AI models. Droege said in the memo that Scale AI would staff up around its enterprise and government sales units.\nLike other AI startups that have been reverse acqui-hired, such as Inflection, it seems that Scale AI now has to pivot from the business that put it on the map. In light of Meta\u2019s investment, several of Scale AI\u2019s largest data customers cut ties with the startup.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI and Anthropic researchers decry 'reckless' safety culture at Elon Musk's xAI\ndescription1:\nAI safety researchers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other organizations are speaking out publicly against the \u201creckless\u201d and \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d safety culture at xAI, the billion-dollar AI startup owned by Elon Musk.\nThe criticisms follow weeks of scandals at xAI that have overshadowed the company\u2019s technological advances.\nLast week, the company\u2019s AI chatbot, Grok, spouted antisemitic comments and repeatedly called itself \u201cMechaHitler.\u201d Shortly after xAI took its chatbot offline to address the problem, it launched an increasingly capable frontier AI model, Grok 4, which TechCrunch and others found to consult Elon Musk\u2019s personal politics for help answering hot-button issues. In the latest development, xAI launched AI companions that take the form of a hyper-sexualized anime girl and an overly aggressive panda.\nFriendly joshing among employees of competing AI labs is fairly normal, but these researchers seem to be calling for increased attention to xAI\u2019s safety practices, which they claim to be at odds with industry norms.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to post on Grok safety since I work at a competitor, but it\u2019s not about competition,\u201d said Boaz Barak, a computer science professor currently on leave from Harvard to work on safety research at OpenAI, in a Tuesday post on X. \u201cI appreciate the scientists and engineers @xai but the way safety was handled is completely irresponsible.\u201d\nI didn't want to post on Grok safety since I work at a competitor, but it's not about competition.\nI appreciate the scientists and engineers at @xai but the way safety was handled is completely irresponsible. Thread below. \u2014 Boaz Barak (@boazbaraktcs) July 15, 2025\nBarak particularly takes issue with xAI\u2019s decision to not publish system cards \u2014 industry standard reports that detail training methods and safety evaluations in a good faith effort to share information with the research community. As a result, Barak says it\u2019s unclear what safety training was done on Grok 4.\nOpenAI and Google have a spotty reputation themselves when it comes to promptly sharing system cards when unveiling new AI models. OpenAI decided not to publish a system card for GPT-4.1, claiming it was not a frontier model. Meanwhile, Google waited months after unveiling Gemini 2.5 Pro to publish a safety report. However, these companies historically publish safety reports for all frontier AI models before they enter full production.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBarak also notes that Grok\u2019s AI companions \u201ctake the worst issues we currently have for emotional dependencies and tries to amplify them.\u201d In recent years, we\u2019ve seen countless stories of unstable people developing concerning relationship with chatbots, and how AI\u2019s over-agreeable answers can tip them over the edge of sanity.\nSamuel Marks, an AI safety researcher with Anthropic, also took issue with xAI\u2019s decision not to publish a safety report, calling the move \u201creckless.\u201d\n\u201cAnthropic, OpenAI, and Google\u2019s release practices have issues,\u201d Marks wrote in a post on X. \u201cBut they at least do something, anything to assess safety pre-deployment and document findings. xAI does not.\u201d\nxAI launched Grok 4 without any documentation of their safety testing. This is reckless and breaks with industry best practices followed by other major AI labs.\nIf xAI is going to be a frontier AI developer, they should act like one. \ud83e\uddf5 \u2014 Samuel Marks (@saprmarks) July 13, 2025\nThe reality is that we don\u2019t really know what xAI did to test Grok 4. In a widely shared post in the online forum LessWrong, one anonymous researcher claims that Grok 4 has no meaningful safety guardrails based on their testing.\nWhether that\u2019s true or not, the world seems to be finding out about Grok\u2019s shortcomings in real time. Several of xAI\u2019s safety issues have since gone viral, and the company claims to have addressed them with tweaks to Grok\u2019s system prompt.\nOpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nDan Hendrycks, a safety adviser for xAI and director of the Center for AI Safety, posted on X that the company did \u201cdangerous capability evaluations\u201d on Grok 4. However, the results to those evaluations have not been publicly shared.\n\u201cIt concerns me when standard safety practices aren\u2019t upheld across the AI industry, like publishing the results of dangerous capability evaluations,\u201d said Steven Adler, an independent AI researcher who previously led safety teams at OpenAI, in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cGovernments and the public deserve to know how AI companies are handling the risks of the very powerful systems they say they\u2019re building.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s interesting about xAI\u2019s questionable safety practices is that Musk has long been one of the AI safety industry\u2019s most notable advocates. The billionaire leader of xAI, Tesla, and SpaceX has warned many times about the potential for advanced AI systems to cause catastrophic outcomes for humans, and he\u2019s praised an open approach to developing AI models.\nAnd yet, AI researchers at competing labs claim xAI is veering from industry norms around safely releasing AI models. In doing so, Musk\u2019s startup may be inadvertently making a strong case for state and federal lawmakers to set rules around publishing AI safety reports.\nThere are several attempts at the state level to do so. California state Sen. Scott Wiener is pushing a bill that would require leading AI labs \u2014 likely including xAI \u2014 to publish safety reports, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is currently considering a similar bill. Advocates of these bills note that most AI labs publish this type of information anyway \u2014 but evidently, not all of them do it consistently.\nAI models today have yet to exhibit real-world scenarios in which they create truly catastrophic harms, such as the death of people or billions of dollars in damages. However, many AI researchers say that this could be a problem in the near future given the rapid progress of AI models, and the billions of dollars Silicon Valley is investing to further improve AI.\nBut even for skeptics of such catastrophic scenarios, there\u2019s a strong case to suggest that Grok\u2019s misbehavior makes the products it powers today significantly worse.\nGrok spread antisemitism around the X platform this week, just a few weeks after the chatbot repeatedly brought up \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in conversations with users. Musk has indicated that Grok will be more ingrained in Tesla vehicles, and xAI is trying to sell its AI models to The Pentagon and other enterprises. It\u2019s hard to imagine that people driving Musk\u2019s cars, federal workers protecting the U.S., or enterprise employees automating tasks will be any more receptive to these misbehaviors than users on X.\nSeveral researchers argue that AI safety and alignment testing not only ensures that the worst outcomes don\u2019t happen, but they also protect against near-term behavioral issues.\nAt the very least, Grok\u2019s incidents tend to overshadow xAI\u2019s rapid progress in developing frontier AI models that best OpenAI and Google\u2019s technology, just a couple years after the startup was founded.\n\ntitle2:\nJack Dorsey pumps $10 million into a nonprofit focused on open-source social media\ndescription2:\nTwitter co-founder and Block CEO Jack Dorsey isn\u2019t just vibe-coding new social apps, like Bitchat and Sun Day, he has invested $10 million in an effort to fund experimental open source projects and other tools that could ultimately transform the social media landscape.\nThese efforts are funneled through an online collective called \u201cand Other Stuff,\u201d formed in May, whose team includes Dorsey; Twitter\u2019s first employee, Evan Henshaw-Plath; \u201cCalle,\u201d creator of the e-cash platform Cashu; Alex Gleason, former engineering head at Truth Social; and Jeff Gardner, the fourth employee at Intercom.\nImage Credits:and Other Stuff\nThe group originally met through collaborating on Nostr, an open, \u201capolitical\u201d social networking protocol that has been receiving the bulk of Dorsey\u2019s attention since Twitter\u2019s sale to Elon Musk and his stepping down from social network Bluesky\u2019s board. However, the team will experiment with other tools, too, like ActivityPub, the protocol that powers the decentralized app Mastodon and others, as well as Cashu.\nImage Credits:Cashu\nIn recent years, Dorsey has been more critical of how social media platforms have evolved, saying that Twitter should have never been a company and that Bluesky seemed to be repeating the mistakes he and others made at Twitter.\nAs a result, the team at \u201cand Other Stuff\u201d is determined not to build a company but is instead operating like a \u201ccommunity of hackers,\u201d explains Henshaw-Plath. Together, they\u2019re working to create technologies that could include new consumer social apps as well as various experiments, like developer tools or libraries, that would allow others to build apps for themselves.\nFor instance, the team is behind an app called Shakespeare, which is like the app-building platform Lovable, but specifically for building Nostr-based social apps with AI assistance.\nImage Credits:shakespeare\nThe group is also behind heynow, a voice note app built on Nostr; Cashu wallet; private messenger White Noise; and the Nostr-based social community +chorus, in addition to the apps Dorsey has already released.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nDevelopments in AI-based coding have made this type of experimentation possible, Henshaw-Plath points out, in the same way that technologies like Ruby on Rails, Django, and JSON helped to fuel an earlier version of the web, dubbed Web 2.0.\nRelated to these efforts, Henshaw-Plath sat down with Dorsey for the debut episode of his new podcast, revolution.social with @rabble. (Henshaw-Plath\u2019s handle on X is @rabble.)\nSince Dorsey lives in Costa Rica and Henshaw-Plath lives in New Zealand, the two met up at a hackathon in Switzerland for the chat. In the nearly hour-long episode, Dorsey delves into Twitter\u2019s history as well as his philosophies around where social media went wrong and how it can be fixed.\n\u201cIt took me a long time to realize this\u2026I didn\u2019t really put it into words until I came back as CEO the second time. But it\u2019s hard for something like [Twitter] to be a company, because you have corporate incentives when it wants to be a protocol,\u201d Dorsey says. He notes that Twitter was at the mercy of its advertisers \u2014 something Musk also faces despite taking Twitter, now called X, private. Musk has even threatened advertisers with lawsuits over ad boycotts driven by their concerns over X\u2019s lack of moderation and controversial comments Musk himself has made.\nWhile Dorsey understands that catering to advertisers was correct for the business and for Twitter\u2019s stock price, it was the \u201cwrong thing for the internet.\u201d\n\u201cThey can just remove the money \u2014 your money \u2014 and your revenue goes down completely,\u201d Dorsey says of advertisers\u2019 power. \u201cSo if [Twitter] were an open protocol, if it were truly an open project, you could build a business on top of it, and you could build a very healthy business on top of it.\u201d\nDorsey eventually funded an effort to build an open protocol inside Twitter, which later spun out to become Bluesky. But Dorsey believes Bluesky faces the same challenges as traditional social media because of its structure \u2014 it\u2019s funded by VCs, like other startups. Already, it has had to bow to government requests and faced moderation challenges, he points out.\n\u201cI think [Bluesky CEO] Jay [Graber] is great. I think the team is great,\u201d Dorsey told Henshaw-Plath, \u201cbut the structure is what I disagree with\u2026I want to push the energy in a different direction, which is more like Bitcoin, which is completely open and not owned by anyone from a protocol layer. That\u2019s what I see in Nostr as well,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to push my energy\u2026rather into the more corporate direction, even if it is a public benefit corporation,\u201d Dorsey adds.\nIn later episodes, Henshaw-Plath will interview others who have insight into how social media and tech have evolved, including journalists like Kara Swisher and Taylor Lorenz, former Twitter head of Trust & Safety Yoel Roth, Substack co-founder Chris Best, Medium CEO Tony Stubblebine, Cory Doctorow (who coined the term \u201censhittification\u201d to describe the state of much of the current web), and renowned misinformation researcher Ren\u00e9e DiResta.\nThe team at \u201cand Other Stuff\u201d is also working on a social media \u201cBill of Rights,\u201d says Henshaw-Plath, which spells out what social media platforms need to provide in areas like privacy, security, interoperability, transparency, identity, self-governance, and portability.\nThis, they believe, will help platforms, including Bluesky and others, remain accountable to their users despite any outside pressure.\nDorsey\u2019s initial investment has gotten the new nonprofit up and running, and he worked on some of its initial iOS apps. Meanwhile, others are contributing their time to build Android versions, developer tools, and different social media experiments.\nMore is still in the works, says Henshaw-Plath.\n\u201cThere are things that we\u2019re not ready to talk about yet that\u2019ll be very exciting,\u201d he teases.\n\ntitle3:\nIndia eyes global quantum computer push - and QpiAI is its chosen vehicle\ndescription3:\nQpiAI, an Indian startup that claims to integrate AI and quantum computing for enterprise use cases, has raised $32 million in a new funding round co-led by the Indian government as the company aims to expand its presence and develop utility-scale quantum computers for markets around the world.\nThe Indian government\u2019s $750 million National Quantum Mission has co-led QpiAI\u2019s all-equity Series A round, alongside Avataar Ventures, at a post-money valuation of $162 million.\nThe funding reflects India\u2019s broader push to establish itself as a quantum computing power. Launched in 2023, the National Quantum Mission is an Indian government initiative that views quantum computing as both an economic opportunity and a national security imperative. The program aims to help develop intermediate-scale quantum computers with 50-1,000 physical qubits within eight years across platforms including superconducting and photonics. It also targets the development of satellite-based quantum communications, inter-city quantum distribution, multi-node quantum networks, magnetometers, and the design and synthesis of quantum materials, including superconductors, semiconductor structures, and topological materials for quantum device fabrication.\nQpiAI is one of eight startups selected by the National Quantum Mission, each receiving an initial grant of up to $3.5 million. Among these companies, the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has subsidiaries in the U.S. and Finland, says it has built India\u2019s first full-stack quantum computer, called QpiAI-Indus, which it launched in April with 25 superconducting qubits.\nFounded in 2019, QpiAI says it integrates quantum computing and AI to provide optimization capabilities in areas such as manufacturing, industrial, transportation, finance, pharma, and materials. The startup says it has developed specialized software, along with its proprietary hardware, to support real-world quantum applications in fields such as materials science and drug discovery.\n\u201cQuantum can really make sure AI is robust,\u201d said QpiAI founder and CEO Nagendra Nagaraja in an interview.\nThe startup views simulation, drug synthesis, and material discovery as some of the key use cases where the combination of AI and quantum could provide a competitive edge.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Currently, it assembles 80% of its machines in-house.\nQpiAI employs a 100-person team, comprising 25 PhDs from international institutions or from Indian institutes. About 50 of its employees are based in India. The company says it has around 20 customers in India and the U.S., including the Indian government, which uses its infrastructure to test algorithms.\nAccording to the company, QpiAI has been profitable at EBITDA level for the past three years, with approximately 60% gross margins and 20% to 30% net margins, Nagaraja told TechCrunch.\nWith the fresh funding, QpiAI plans to enter new markets including Singapore and the Middle East. It also aims to allocate funds for its local manufacturing plans and scale its operations to develop a 100-logical qubit system by 2030.\nIn June of last year, QpiAI raised $6.5 million in a pre-Series A round led by YourNest and SVCL at a post-money valuation of around $30 million.\nNagaraja told TechCrunch that QpiAI has a three- to four-year runway, even without accounting for its profitability. He also said the startup is considering an initial public offering in either 2026 or 2027.\nThe National Quantum Mission\u2019s support extends beyond QpiAI. The Indian government\u2019s program is also backing startups such as QNu Labs (working on quantum-safe networks), Dimira Technologies (cryogenic cables), PrenishQ (diode-laser systems), and QuPrayog (optical atomic clocks). It has also supported Quanastra (cryogenic systems and superconducting detectors), Pristine Diamonds (diamond-based sensing materials), and Quan2D Technologies (single-photon detectors for quantum communication).\n\u201cWe plan to continue to support home-grown product companies like QpiAI to help them expand into large enterprises and position India as global leaders in quantum technologies,\u201d said Ajai Chowdhry, chairman of India\u2019s National Quantum Mission, in a prepared statement.\n\ntitle4:\nNvidia's resumption of H20 chip sales related to rare-earth element trade talks\ndescription4:\nRare-earth elements appear to be behind Nvidia\u2019s stance on China.\nAfter announcing in June plans to essentially withdraw from the Chinese market, the semiconductor chip and AI giant reversed course and said it was filing an application to restart sales of its H20 AI chip to China.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that Nvidia\u2019s plans to start selling its H20 AI chips are tied to ongoing trade discussions with China regarding rare-earth elements, according to reporting from Reuters. AMD plans to restart sales of its MI308 AI chip in China too.\nRare-earth elements (REE) like lanthanum and cerium, which are largely mined in China, are necessary components in technology, including rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles. These REEs have become a critical point in the current trade debates between the U.S. and China.\nNot everyone is happy with this trade development though.\nThe decision \u201cwould not only hand our foreign adversaries our most advanced technologies, but is also dangerously inconsistent with this administration\u2019s previously-stated position on export controls for China,\u201d Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi said in a statement, according to Reuters.\nBut Lutnick isn\u2019t concerned and told CNBC on Tuesday that China is only getting Nvidia\u2019s \u201cfourth best\u201d chip.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
