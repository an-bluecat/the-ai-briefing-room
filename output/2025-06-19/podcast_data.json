Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

But the company said there are no reported injuries. SpaceX was preparing to perform a \u201cstatic fire\u201d of the Starship\u2019s six Raptor engines, and so the area around the rocket had been cleared prior to the explosion.\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear what impact this will have on SpaceX\u2019s development of the Starship rocket system. A recent advisory from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) suggested the tenth test flight could have happened as soon as June 29. That will most likely be delayed as the company works through what went wrong on Wednesday night.\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk said in a post seemingly related to the explosion that he considers it to be: \u201cJust a scratch.\u201d\nANOMALY! Just before Ship 36 was set to Static Fire, it blew up at SpaceX Masseys!\nLive on X and YT:https://t.co/GPjZIX1Zyd pic.twitter.com/CfZhDeSGae \u2014 NSF \u2013 NASASpaceflight.com (@NASASpaceflight) June 19, 2025\nSpaceX has spent the last few years aggressively developing the 171-foot Starship and the massive 232-foot Super Heavy booster that powers it into space. The company started 2025 saying this year would be a \u201ctransformational\u201d one for the program, and the FAA recently increased its limit on Starship launches in Texas from 5 to 25.\nBut Starship, in particular, has had a number of problems this year. The rocket unexpectedly exploded during its seventh test flight in January, and then again in March. It failed again during its ninth test in May.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster. Connect deeper.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nWhile the rocket made it further into its most recent flight in May than during the previous two tests, it still failed to deploy the dummy Starlink satellites it was carrying onboard \u2014 a crucial step in the company\u2019s plan to use the mega-rocket to grow its space-based internet service.\nMusk has maintained that SpaceX is on track to try to send a Starship to Mars in 2026, giving it a \u201c50/50\u201d chance in a company update in May. The company is also developing a larger \u201cVersion 3\u201d of Starship that, Musk claimed, could fly as early as this year.\nThis story has been updated with new information from SpaceX about what it believes to be the cause of the explosion.\n\ntitle2:\nEvery fusion startup that has raised over $100M\ndescription2:\nOver the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes \u2014 always a decade away! \u2014 to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.\nThe technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what\u2019s known as scientific breakeven, and while it\u2019s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems\nWith a $1.8 billion Series B, Commonwealth Fusion Systems catapulted itself into the pole position in 2021. Since then, the company has been quiet on the fundraising front (no surprise), but it has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls \u201ccommercially relevant\u201d levels.\nSparc\u2019s reactor uses a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. In Sparc\u2019s successor, the commercial-scale Arc, heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nBacked by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others, Devens, Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Arc operational in the early 2030s. The company has raised a total of $2 billion, according to PitchBook.\nTAE\nFounded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\nThe company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook.\nHelion\nOf all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\nHelion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma\u2019s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor\u2019s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\nThe company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\nPacific Fusion\nPacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.\nThe company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion\u2019s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn\u2019t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that\u2019s common in biotech.\nShine Technologies\nShine Technologies is taking a cautious \u2014 and possibly pragmatic \u2014 approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it\u2019s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn\u2019t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it\u2019s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.\nThe company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\nGeneral Fusion\nNow its third-decade, General Fusion has raised $440.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\nIn an General Fusion\u2019s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\nGeneral Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff.\nTokamak Energy\nTokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design \u2014 the doughnut shape \u2014 and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.\nThe Oxfordshire, UK-based startup\u2019s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Faberg\u00e9 egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company\u2019s magnets in \u201cfusion power plant-relevant scenarios.\u201d Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.\nIn total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.\nZap Energy\nZap Energy isn\u2019t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.\nProxima Fusion\nMost investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.\nProxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a \u20ac130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than \u20ac185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\nStellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist \u2014 literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma\u2019s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.\nMarvel Fusion\nMarvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry\u2019s decades of experience.\nThe inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.\nFirst Light\nFirst Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.\nFirst Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent.\nXcimer\nThough nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that\u2019s behind the National Ignition Facility\u2019s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF\u2019s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.\nFounded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.\nThis story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.\n\ntitle3:\nThe Robinhood founder who might just revolutionize energy (if he succeeds)\ndescription3:\nWhen Baiju Bhatt stepped away from his role as Chief Creative Officer at Robinhood last year, only those close to him could have predicted his next move: launching a space company built around tech that the aerospace industry has largely dismissed, and which might be more groundbreaking than anyone realizes.\nIf people aren\u2019t paying much attention, that\u2019s just fine with Bhatt, who co-founded the trading app in 2013, five years after earning his master\u2019s degree in mathematics at Stanford. It means less competition for his new company, Aetherflux, which has so far raised $60 million on its quest to prove that beaming solar power from space isn\u2019t science fiction but a new chapter for both renewable energy and national defense.\n\u201cUntil you do stuff in space, if you happen to be an aerospace company, you\u2019re actually an aspiring space company,\u201d Bhatt said on Wednesday night at a TechCrunch StrictlyVC event held in a glass-lined structure on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park. \u201cI would like to transition from \u2018aspiring space company\u2019 to \u2018space company\u2019 sooner.\u201d\nBhatt\u2019s space ambitions date back to his childhood. He says that his dad, who worked as an optometrist in India, spent a decade applying to graduate physics programs in the United States, eventually taking a hard left turn and landing at NASA as a research scientist.\nHe then proceeded to use the powers of reverse psychology on his son, says Bhatt. \u201cMy dad worked at NASA through my whole childhood\u201d and \u201che was very adamant: \u2018When you grow up, I\u2019m not going to tell you you should study physics.\u2019 Which is a very effective way of convincing somebody to do exactly that.\u201d\nImage Credits:Slava Blazer Photography / TechCrunch\nNow, at roughly the same age his father was when he joined NASA, Bhatt is making his own move into space, seemingly with an eye toward creating even more impact than at Robinhood.\nHe\u2019s certainly taking a big swing with the effort.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nTraditional space solar power concepts have focused on massive geostationary satellites, using microwave transmission to beam energy to Earth. The scale and complexity made these projects perpetually \u201c20 years away,\u201d Bhatt said Wednesday night. \u201cEverything was too big . . .The size of the array, the size of the spacecraft was the size of a small city. That\u2019s real science fiction stuff.\u201d\nHis solution is both far smaller and more nimble, he suggested. Most notably, instead of massive microwave antennas that require precise phase coordination, Aetherflux\u2019s satellites will use fiber lasers, essentially converting solar power back into focused light that can be precisely targeted at receivers on the ground.\n\u201cWe take the solar power that we collect from the sun with solar panels, and we take that energy and put it into a set of diodes that turn it back into light,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cThat light goes into a fiber where there\u2019s a laser, which then lets us point that down to the ground.\u201d\nThe idea is to launch a demonstration satellite in June of next year.\nNational security, first\nWhile Bhatt envisions eventually building \u201ca true industrial-scale energy company,\u201d he\u2019s starting with national defense. In fact, the Department of Defense has approved funding for Aetherflux\u2019s program, recognizing the military value of beaming power to forward bases without the logistical nightmare of transporting fuel. \u201cIt allows the U.S. to have energy out in the battlefield,\u201d Bhatt explained.\nThe precision Bhatt is promising is pretty remarkable. Aetherflux\u2019s initial target is a laser spot \u201cbigger than 10 meters diameter\u201d on the ground, but Bhatt believes they can shrink it to \u201cfive to 10 meters, potentially even smaller than that.\u201d These compact, lightweight receivers would be \u201cof little to no strategic value if captured by an adversary\u201d and \u201csmall enough and portable enough that you can literally bring them out into the battlefield.\u201d\nWhile much remains to be seen \u2014 pretty much the whole shebang, really \u2014 success for Aetherflux could potentially change the game for American military operations worldwide.\nSo why hasn\u2019t someone already done what Aetherflux is attempting? As noted last year in Space News, a 2007 study found promise in the approach and recommended more research, but no one acted on the report (and Bhatt said at the time that he wasn\u2019t aware of it). Either way, to Bhatt, it\u2019s the kind of overlooked opportunity that an outsider is well-positioned to seize. Indeed, in addition to his own father, Bhatt said that he draws inspiration from someone else who has proved that if you\u2019re curious and willing to work hard, you can master multiple industries: Elon Musk. That outsider perspective \u201cis actually an advantage,\u201d Bhatt told the crowd.\nOf course, unlike the iterate-fast mentality of companies like Robinhood that can roll out, and also sometimes roll back, software features, space hardware involves much higher stakes. You only get one shot when your satellite launches.\n\u201cWe build one spacecraft, we bolt it to the fairing inside of the SpaceX rocket, we put it in space, and it detaches, and then the thing better work,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go up there and tighten the bolt.\u201d\nAsked during the sit-down how he pressure-tests that spacecraft, Bhatt said that Aetherflux is pursuing a \u201chardware-rich\u201d approach, which means building and testing components while refining designs. \u201cThe right balance is not waiting five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, as is the case with many important space programs,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople\u2019s careers are oftentimes shorter than that.\u201d\nHe also noted that if Aetherflux succeeds, the implications extend far beyond military applications. Space-based solar power could provide baseload renewable energy, or solar power that works day and night, anywhere on Earth. That might mean turning upside down the ways we currently think about energy distribution, offering power to remote locations without massive infrastructure investments and providing emergency power during disasters.\nAetherflux has already hired a mix of physicists, mathematicians, and engineers from Lawrence Livermore Labs, Rivian, Cruise, and SpaceX, among other places, and Bhatt said the 25-person organization is still hiring. \u201cIf you are the kind of person that wants to work on stuff that\u2019s super, super difficult, please come and contact us,\u201d he told attendees.\nBhatt has more than his reputation riding on what happens from here. He self-funded Aetherflux\u2019s first $10 million, and he says he also contributed to a more recent $50 million round that was led by Index Ventures and Interlagos, and included Bill Gates\u2019s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and NEA, among others.\nAetherflux\u2019s timeline is aggressive, too. The plan is to launch a demonstration satellite precisely one year from now, which is basically around the corner.\nStill, there\u2019s a prototype for Bhatt\u2019s approach. GPS started as a DARPA project before becoming ubiquitous civilian infrastructure. Similarly, Aetherflux is working closely with DARPA\u2019s beaming expert, Dr. Paul Jaffe, who Bhatt called \u201ca pretty good friend to our company.\u201d Jaffe also works with other companies developing similar technology, positioning DARPA as a bridge between military applications and commercial potential.\n\u201cThere\u2019s this precedent of doing stuff in space where there\u2019s a really important part of working with the government,\u201d Bhatt said. \u201cBut we actually think, over time, as the technology matures and things like [SpaceX\u2019s reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle] Starship really open up commercial access to space, this is not going to be just a Department of Defense thing.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nBluesky briefly suspended JD Vance's account after he joined\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nWhen U.S. Vice President JD Vance joined Bluesky on Wednesday evening, he got banned immediately.
