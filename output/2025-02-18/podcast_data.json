Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.
