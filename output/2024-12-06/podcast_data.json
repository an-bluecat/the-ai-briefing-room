    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday December 9), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMeta shares rise on potential TikTok ban in U.S., closing at record\ndescription0:\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Inc., arrives for the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, on Sept. 25, 2024.\nMeta shares continued their extended rally on Friday, rising 2.4% and closing at a record after a federal appeals court upheld a law requiring China's ByteDance to sell TikTok or face an effective U.S. ban.\nThe Facebook parent has climbed 77% this year after almost tripling in 2023, pushing Meta's market cap close to $1.6 trillion.\nAlongside Meta, Amazon also closed at an all-time high on Friday and is up 49% this year. Apple slid slightly from its high on Thursday. The hefty gains this year among tech's megacaps helped lift the Nasdaq to a record. The index rose 0.8% on Friday and has gained 32% in 2024.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined president-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last week for a dinner, where he demonstrated the company's camera-equipped Ray-Ban specs, Fox News first reported. Zuckerberg, who has been the subject of frequent verbal attacks by the incoming president, is apparently seeking an active role working with the Trump administration.\nTikTok is one of Meta's biggest rivals and has soared in popularity in recent years, particularly with younger audiences, and now has about 170 million users in the U.S. In April, President Joe Biden signed a law that would require ByteDance to divest the app, or companies such as Apple and Google as well as internet hosting providers would have to stop supporting it.\nThe unanimous ruling on Friday by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., rejected TikTok's argument that the law is unconstitutional and violates the First Amendment rights of its users. TikTok said later Friday that it will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court decision.\n\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in an email.\nMeta's rally began in late 2022 and picked up steam early last year after Zuckerberg declared 2023 the \"year of efficiency.\" The company slashed about 21,000 jobs and rebuilt its advertising systems with the help of new advancements in artificial intelligence.\nIn its third-quarter earnings release, Meta reported a 19% increase in year-over-year revenue while warning of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025. The company reported 3.29 billion \"daily active people\" for the third quarter, up just 5% year over year.\nZuckerberg has been talking up Meta's efforts to develop new AI products and services, which will require spending billions of dollars on Nvidia graphics processing units and the energy to run them. Meta has been building out data centers to shore up the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy.\nPosting on the Threads app on Friday, Zuckerberg said Meta AI \"now has nearly 600 million monthly actives,\" and will soon release version 3.3 of its Llama open-source large language model. Zuckerberg did not say how Meta counts a \"monthly active\" user for its AI technology.\n\ntitle1:\nX\u2019s Grok AI chatbot is now available to all users\ndescription1:\nElon Musk\u2019s AI chatbot Grok is now available to free users on X. Several users noticed the change on Friday, which gives non-Premium subscribers the ability to send up to 10 messages to Grok every two hours.\nxAI launched Grok last year as a \u201chumorous AI assistant,\u201d but it was only available to Premium subscribers. In August, xAI added a text-to-image generation feature to Grok, which turned out to be capable of producing some questionable images.\nTechCrunch reported last month that Musk\u2019s xAI started testing a free version of Grok in certain regions. Making Grok more widely available might help it compete with the already-free chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta unveils a new, more efficient Llama model\ndescription2:\nMeta has announced the newest addition to its Llama family of generative AI models: Llama 3.3 70B.\nIn a post on X, Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said that the text-only Llama 3.3 70B delivers the performance of Meta\u2019s largest Llama model, Llama 3.1 405B, at lower cost.\n\u201cBy leveraging the latest advancements in post-training techniques \u2026 this model improves core performance at a significantly lower cost,\u201d Al-Dahle wrote.\nAl-Dahle published a chart showing Llama 3.3 70B outperforming Google\u2019s Gemini 1.5 Pro, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Amazon\u2019s newly released Nova Pro on a number of industry benchmarks, including MMLU, which evaluates a model\u2019s ability to understand language. Via email, a Meta spokesperson said that the model should deliver improvements in areas like math, general knowledge, instruction following, and app use.\nLlama 3.3 70B, which is available for download from the AI dev platform Hugging Face and other sources, including the official Llama website, is Meta\u2019s latest play to dominate the AI field with \u201copen\u201d models that can be used and commercialized for a range of applications.\nMeta\u2019s terms constrain how certain developers can use Llama models; platforms with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license. But for many, it\u2019s immaterial that Llama models aren\u2019t \u201copen\u201d in the strictest sense. Case in point, Llama has racked up more than 650 million downloads, according to Meta.\nMeta has leveraged Llama internally as well. Meta AI, the company\u2019s AI assistant, which is powered entirely by Llama models, now has nearly 600 million monthly active users, per Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg claims that Meta AI is on track to be the most-used AI assistant in the world.\nFor Meta, the open nature of Llama has been a blessing and a curse. In November, a report alleged that Chinese military researchers had used a Llama model to develop a defense chatbot. Meta responded by making its Llama models available to U.S. defense contractors.\nMeta has also voiced concerns about its ability to comply with the AI Act, the EU law that establishes a regulatory framework for AI, calling the law\u2019s implementation \u201ctoo unpredictable\u201d for its open release strategy. A related issue for the company are provisions in the GDPR, the EU\u2019s privacy law, pertaining to AI training. Meta trains AI models on the public data of Instagram and Facebook users who haven\u2019t opted out \u2014 data that in Europe is subject to GDPR guarantees.\nEU regulators earlier this year requested that Meta halt training on European user data while they assessed the company\u2019s GDPR compliance. Meta relented, while at the same time endorsing an open letter calling for \u201ca modern interpretation\u201d of GDPR that doesn\u2019t \u201creject progress.\u201d\nMeta, not immune to the technical challenges other AI labs are encountering, is ramping up its computing infrastructure to train and serve future generations of Llama. The company announced Wednesday that it would build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana \u2014 the largest AI data center Meta has ever built.\nZuckerberg said on Meta\u2019s Q4 earnings call in August that to train the next major set of Llama models, Llama 4, the company will need 10x more compute than what was needed to train Llama 3. Meta has procured a cluster of more than 100,000 Nvidia GPUs for model development, rivaling the resources of competition like xAI.\nTraining generative AI models is a costly business. Meta\u2019s capital expenditures rose nearly 33% to $8.5 billion in Q2 2024, up from $6.4 billion a year earlier, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure.\n\ntitle3:\nWill people really pay $200 a month for OpenAI's new chatbot?\ndescription3:\nOn Thursday, OpenAI released what\u2019s effectively a $200-a-month chatbot \u2014 and the AI community didn\u2019t know quite what to make of it.\nThe company\u2019s new ChatGPT Pro plan grants access to \u201co1 pro mode,\u201d which OpenAI says \u201cuses more compute for the best answers to the hardest questions.\u201d A souped-up version of OpenAI\u2019s o1 reasoning model, o1 pro mode should answer questions relating to science, math, and coding more \u201creliably\u201d and \u201ccomprehensively,\u201d OpenAI says.\nAlmost immediately, people started asking it to draw unicorns:\nAnd design a \u201ccrab-based\u201d computer:\nAnd wax poetic on the meaning of life:\nBut many folks on X didn\u2019t seem convinced that o1 pro mode\u2019s answers were, well, $200-level.\n\u201cHave OpenAI shared any concrete examples of prompts that fail in regular o1 but succeed in o1-pro?\u201d asked British computer scientist Simon Willison. \u201cI want to see a single concrete example that shows its advantage.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a reasonable question; after all, this is the world\u2019s most expensive chatbot subscription. The service comes with other benefits, like the removal of rate limits and unlimited access to OpenAI\u2019s other models. But $2,400 per year isn\u2019t chump change, and the value proposition of o1 pro mode in particular remains murky.\nIt didn\u2019t take long to find failure cases. O1 pro mode struggles with Sudoku, and it\u2019s tripped up by an optical illusion joke that\u2019s obvious to any human.\nOpenAI\u2019s internal benchmarks show that o1 pro mode performs only slightly better than the standard o1 on coding and math problems:\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nOpenAI ran a \u201cstricter\u201d evaluation on the same benchmarks to showcase o1 pro mode\u2019s consistency: the model was only considered to have solved a question if it got the answer right four out of four times. But even in these tests, the improvements weren\u2019t dramatic:\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who once wrote that OpenAI was on a path \u201ctowards intelligence too cheap to meter,\u201d was forced to clarify multiple times on Thursday that ChatGPT Pro isn\u2019t for most people.\n\u201cMost users will be very happy with the o1 in the [ChatGPT] Plus tier!\u201d he said on X. \u201cAlmost everyone will be best-served by our free tier or the Plus tier.\u201d\nSo who is it for? Are there really people out there willing to pay $200 a month to ask toy questions like \u201cWrite a 3-paragraph essay on strawberries without using the letter \u2018e\u2019\u201d or \u201csolve this Math Olympiad problem\u201c? Will they happily part ways with their hard-earned cash without much guarantee that the standard o1 can\u2019t satisfactorily answer the same questions?\nI asked Ameet Talwalkar, an associate professor of machine learning at Carnegie Mellon and a venture partner at Amplify Partners, his opinion. \u201cIt seems like a big risk to me to raise the price tenfold,\u201d he told TechCrunch via email. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a much better sense in just a few weeks as to the appetite for this functionality.\u201d\nUCLA computer scientist Guy Van den Broeck was more candid in his assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the price point makes sense,\u201d he told TechCrunch, \u201cand if pricey reasoning models will be the norm.\u201d\nA generous take is that it\u2019s a marketing blunder. Describing o1 pro mode as best at solving \u201cthe hardest problems\u201d doesn\u2019t tell prospective customers much. Nor do vague statements about how the model can \u201cthink longer\u201d and demonstrate \u201cintelligence.\u201d As Willison points out, without specific examples of this supposedly improved capability, it\u2019s hard to justify paying more at all, let alone ten times the price.\nSo far as I can tell, experts in specialized fields are the intended audience. OpenAI says it plans to grant a handful of medical researchers at \u201cleading institutions\u201d free access to ChatGPT Pro, which will include o1 pro mode. Mistakes matter a lot in healthcare, and, as Bob McGrew, OpenAI\u2019s former chief research officer, noted on X, better reliability is perhaps o1 pro mode\u2019s chief unlock.\nMcGrew also mused o1 pro mode is an example of what he calls \u201cintelligence overhang\u201d: users (and perhaps the model\u2019s creators) not knowing how to get value from any \u201cextra intelligence\u201d due to fundamental limits of a simple, text-based interface. As with OpenAI\u2019s other models, the only way to interact with o1 pro mode is through ChatGPT, and \u2014 to McGrew\u2019s point \u2014 ChatGPT isn\u2019t perfect.\nIt\u2019s also true, though, that $200 sets expectations high. And judging by the early reception on social media, ChatGPT Pro is no slam dunk.\n\ntitle4:\nRivian's EVs ranked last on Consumer Reports reliability list\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nConsumer Reports has put out its annual automaker reliability list, and the top spot is relatively unsurprising: Subaru. What may come as a surprise to some is that Rivian\u2019s EVs are dead last, especially considering the company topped a different Consumer Reports survey from earlier this year about the \u201cmost loved\u201d auto brands.\nThe consumer outlet said the reliability of Rivian\u2019s SUV and pickup are either below or well below the average of other automakers\u2019 vehicles. The company\u2019s EVs did have some company, though, as Ford\u2019s F-150 Lightning scored similarly poor marks, as did the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet\u2019s Blazer EV, which really stumbled out of the gate.\nConsumer Reports noted that customers struggle with problems related to these EVs\u2019 electric motors, batteries, and charging systems. But customers also experienced problems with the advanced technology in the cabin, like touchscreen-focused infotainment systems. The outlet also said it lacked sufficient data to evaluate EVs from upstart Lucid Motors, or from the likes of Porsche and Polestar.\nOverall, Consumer Reports says EVs are improving in reliability. Some scored particularly well, including Ford\u2019s Mustang Mach-E, while the reliability of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 and Model Y was more average. But all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids still give owners more problems than standard hybrid cars or ones with internal combustion engines.\"\n\nResponse:",
