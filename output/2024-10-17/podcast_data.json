Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday October 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nProfit beats expectations as AI boom drives 54% hike\ndescription0:\nIn this photo illustration, a TSMC logo is displayed on the screen of a smartphone.\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest producer of advanced chips, serving clients such as Apple and Nvidia , jumped nearly 10% during trading on Thursday after the company reported a 54% hike in net profit in the third quarter. The company expects annual revenue growth in the last three months of the year, as global chipmakers continue to benefit from demand boosted by artificial intelligence applications.\nShares of chip companies rose on the results. Shares of Nvidia , Micron and AMD were all up almost 1% at market close on Thursday.\nThe company's net income was 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.1 billion) over the July-September quarter, surpassing an LSEG estimate of NT$300.2 billion cited by Reuters.\nNet revenue came in at $23.5 billion in the third quarter, up 36% year on year, with TSMC's gross margin rising to 57.8% over July-September, compared with 54.3% in the same period of last year.\n\"Based on the current business outlook, we expect for our fourth-quarter revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion, which represents a 13% sequential increase or a 35% year-over-year increase at the midpoint,\" TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said during an earnings call following the results release, according to a call transcript produced by FactSet.\nIn the third quarter, \"our business was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,\" TSMC said in a statement, referencing its semiconductor nodes.\n\ntitle1:\nStripe in talks to acquire Bridge for $1 billion\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nStripe is in talks to acquire stablecoin platform Bridge for a whopping $1 billion, according to Forbes. The talks are reportedly in advanced stages, although nothing has been finalized.\nBridge, co-founded by Coinbase alumni Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, has built an API that helps companies accept stablecoins. The pair raised $58 million from investors like Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, according to PitchBook. If the deal with Stripe goes through, it would be a huge jump from Bridge\u2019s $200 million valuation, as well as being Stripe\u2019s largest acquisition to date.\nStripe has made it clear that crypto is a huge priority for the company. In July, it enabled crypto purchases in the EU, and earlier this month, Stripe announced a Pay with Crypto feature that lets merchants accept stablecoins.\n\ntitle2:\nElon Musk's X is changing its privacy policy to allow third parties to train AI on your posts\ndescription2:\nOn Wednesday, social network X (formerly Twitter) updated its Privacy Policy to indicate that it would allow third-party \u201ccollaborators\u201d to train their AI models on X data, unless users opt out. While X owner Elon Musk trained xAI\u2019s Grok AI chatbot on X user data, leading to an investigation by the EU\u2019s lead privacy regulator, the company hadn\u2019t yet amended its policy to indicate its data may also be used by third parties.\nThe addition to the policy implies that X, like Reddit and various media organizations, is looking into licensing data to AI companies as a potential new revenue stream.\nIn Section 3 of the updated Privacy Policy titled \u201cSharing Information,\u201d X added a paragraph detailing how X user data can be used and how users could opt out.\nIt reads:\n\u201cThird-party collaborators. Depending on your settings, or if you decide to share your data, we may share or disclose your information with third parties. If you do not opt out, in some instances the recipients of the information may use it for their own independent purposes in addition to those stated in X\u2019s Privacy Policy, including, for example, to train their artificial intelligence models, whether generative or otherwise.\u201d\nThe policy points to the settings page on X, but does not specifically indicate where users would go within the settings to toggle off data-sharing. Currently, the \u201cPrivacy and safety\u201d section in settings lets users turn on or off data-sharing with xAI\u2019s Grok and with other \u201cbusiness partners,\u201d but the latter is described as those companies that X may work with to \u201crun and improve its products,\u201d not other AI providers.\nThat may be because the updated privacy policy won\u2019t become effective until November 15, at which point the opt-out option could be added. (We hope.)\nIn addition, the company removed a paragraph that said it keeps user \u201cprofile information and content for the duration of your account,\u201d and that it keeps other \u201cpersonally identifiable data we collect when you use our products and services for a maximum of 18 months.\u201d\nInstead, the new section explains that X will keep \u201cdifferent types of information for different periods of time, depending on how long we need to retain it in order to provide you with our products and services, to comply with our legal requirements and for safety and security reasons.\u201d As an example, it notes that usage information like the \u201ccontent you post\u201d and your interactions with others\u2019 content will be kept for \u201cthe duration of your account or until such content is removed.\u201d\nThe policy also added a note reminding users that public content can exist elsewhere even after it\u2019s removed from X. This could potentially cover the data\u2019s ingestion by AI providers, as X adds, \u201csearch engines and other third parties may retain copies of your posts longer, based upon their own privacy policies, even after they are deleted or expire on X.\u201d\nSeparately, X has added a new \u201cLiquidated Damages\u201d section to its updated Terms of Service that says any organization scraping its content will be liable for damages. Specifically, \u201cfor requesting, viewing, or accessing more than 1,000,000 posts (including reply posts, video posts, image posts, and any other posts) in any 24-hour period,\u201d X says the organization will be charged $15,000 USD per 1,000,000 posts.\nThe move to monetize X data follows advertiser withdrawals and boycotts and a subscription feature that has yet to take off, which have left the company in need of new ways to pay its bills.\nX did not respond to a request for comment.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle CEO names new search, ads boss, Raghavan to chief technologist\ndescription3:\nGoogle is replacing Prabhakar Raghavan, the company's search and ads boss, with longtime Google executive Nick Fox.\nThe move was announced by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who said in a blog post on Thursday that Raghavan will be moving into the role of chief technologist after 12 years of leading teams across the search company. Raghavan will continue to report to Pichai in the new role, the company told CNBC in a statement.\n\"Prabhakar has decided it's time to make a big leap in his own career,\" Pichai wrote in the post. \"In this role, he'll partner closely with me and Google leads to provide technical direction and leadership and grow our culture of tech excellence.\"\nThe move comes as Google continues to restructure its teams to move more quickly in the artificial intelligence arms race, where it faces increased competition. The company is also dealing with several antitrust lawsuits related to its search and ads business.\nFox has long been a member of Raghavan's leadership team. He will be leading Google's Knowledge and Information division, which includes the company's search, ads and commerce products, Pichai said.\nA Google employee since 2003, Fox has been vice president of product and design for the company's Assistant product in recent years. He previously worked within the company's ads business unit.\n\"Over the past few years, Nick has been instrumental in shaping Google's AI product roadmap and collaborating closely with Prabhakar,\" Pichai wrote.\nRaghavan has led the knowledge and information unit since 2018. Earlier this year, he told employees to prepare for a different market reality because \"things are not like they were 15-20 years ago,\" CNBC reported.\nAdditionally, Pichai announced that the team working on Google's Gemini app, which includes Google's AI direct-to-consumer products, will join Google DeepMind under AI head Demis Hassabis.\n\"Bringing the teams closer together will improve feedback loops, enable fast deployment of our new models in the Gemini app,\" Pichai wrote.\nThe move also means the Assistant teams focused on devices and home experiences will move to the Platforms and Devices unit \"so they can sit closer to the product surfaces they're building for,\" Pichai wrote.\nCorrection: A prior version of this story said Raghavan was becoming CTO. A Google spokesperson said the company was incorrect in offering that information.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft said it lost weeks of security logs for its customers' cloud products\ndescription4:\nMicrosoft has notified customers that it\u2019s missing more than two weeks of security logs for some of its cloud products, leaving network defenders without critical data for detecting possible intrusions.\nAccording to a notification sent to affected customers, Microsoft said that \u201ca bug in one of Microsoft\u2019s internal monitoring agents resulted in a malfunction in some of the agents when uploading log data to our internal logging platform\u201d between September 2 and September 19.\nThe notification said that the logging outage was not caused by a security incident, and \u201conly affected the collection of log events.\u201d\nBusiness Insider first reported the loss of log data earlier in October. Details of the notification have not been widely reported. As noted by security researcher Kevin Beaumont, the notifications that Microsoft sent to affected companies are likely accessible only to a handful of users with tenant admin rights.\nLogging helps to keep track of events within a product, such as information about users signing in and failed attempts, which can help network defenders identify suspected intrusions. Missing logs could make it more difficult to identify unauthorized access to the customers\u2019 networks during that two-week window.\nThe affected products include Microsoft Entra, Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Purview, according to the Business Insider report. Affected customers \u201cmay have experienced potential gaps in security related logs or events, possibly affecting customers\u2019 ability to analyze data, detect threats, or generate security alerts,\u201d the notification said.\nMicrosoft would not answer specific questions about the logging outage, but a Microsoft executive confirmed to TechCrunch that the incident was caused by an \u201coperational bug within our internal monitoring agent.\u201d\n\u201cWe have mitigated the issue by rolling back a service change. We have communicated to all impacted customers and will provide support as needed,\u201d said John Sheehan, a Microsoft corporate vice president.\nThe logging outage comes a year after Microsoft came under fire from federal investigators for withholding security logs from certain U.S. federal government departments that host their emails on the company\u2019s hardened, government-only cloud; investigators said having access to those logs could have identified a series of China-backed intrusions far sooner.\nThe China-backed intruders, referred to as Storm-0558, broke into Microsoft\u2019s network and stole a digital skeleton key that allowed the hackers unfettered access to U.S. government emails stored in Microsoft\u2019s cloud. According to a government-issued postmortem of the cyberattack, the State Department identified the intrusions because it paid for a higher-tier Microsoft license that granted access to security logs for its cloud products, which many other hacked U.S. government agencies did not have.\nFollowing the China-backed hacks, Microsoft said it would start providing logs to its lower-paid cloud accounts from September 2023.\nCarly Page contributed reporting.\"\n\nResponse:",
