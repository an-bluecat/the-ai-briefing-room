Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday December 25), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nNvidia to license AI chip challenger Groq's tech and hire its CEO\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nNvidia has struck a non-exclusive licensing agreement with AI chip competitor Groq. As part of the deal, Nvidia will hire Groq founder Jonathan Ross, president Sunny Madra, and other employees.\nCNBC reported that Nvidia is acquiring assets from Groq for $20 billion; Nvidia told TechCrunch that this is not an acquisition of the company and did not comment on the scope of the deal. But if CNBC\u2019s numbers are accurate, this purchase is expected to be Nvidia\u2019s largest ever, and with Groq on its side, Nvidia is poised to become even more dominant in chip manufacturing.\nAs tech companies compete to grow their AI capabilities, they need computing power, and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs have emerged as the industry standard. But Groq has been working on a different type of chip called an LPU (language processing unit), which it has claimed can run LLMs at 10 times faster and using one-tenth the energy. Groq\u2019s CEO Jonathan Ross is known for this sort of innovation \u2014 when he worked for Google, he helped invent the TPU (tensor processing unit), a custom AI accelerator chip.\nIn September, Groq raised $750 million at a $6.9 billion valuation. Its growth has been quick and significant \u2014 the company said that it powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from about 356,000 last year.\nUpdated, 12/24/25 at 5:40 p.m. ET, with clarification from Nvidia about the nature of the deal.\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo explains why its robotaxis got stuck during the SF blackout\ndescription1:\nWaymo is shipping a software update to help its robotaxis navigate disabled traffic lights during power outages \u201cmore decisively,\u201d the company said Tuesday in a blog post that explains why its self-driving vehicles got stuck at intersections during a blackout in San Francisco this past weekend.\nWaymo said the self-driving system in its robotaxis treats dead stop lights as four-way stops, just like humans are supposed to. That should have allowed the robotaxis to operate normally in spite of the massive outage.\nInstead, many of the vehicles requested a \u201cconfirmation check\u201d from Waymo\u2019s fleet response team to make sure what they were doing was correct. All Waymo robotaxis have the ability to make these confirmation checks. With such a widespread outage on Saturday, there was a \u201cconcentrated spike\u201d in these confirmation requests, Waymo said, which helped create all the congestion caught on video.\nWaymo said it built this confirmation request system \u201cout of an abundance of caution during our early deployment\u201d but that it is now refining it to \u201cmatch our current scale.\u201d\n\u201cWhile this strategy was effective during smaller outages, we are now implementing fleet-wide updates that provide the [self-driving software] with specific power outage context, allowing it to navigate more decisively,\u201d the company wrote.\nThe software update will add \u201ceven more context about regional outages\u201d to the company\u2019s self-driving software. Waymo also said it will improve its emergency response protocols by \u201cincorporating lessons from this event.\u201d\nWhile a lot of focus has been placed on the instances where Waymo\u2019s robotaxis got stuck during the power outage, the company shared that its vehicles \u201csuccessfully traversed more than 7,000 dark signals on Saturday.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cNavigating an event of this magnitude presented a unique challenge for autonomous technology,\u201d the company wrote.\nSaturday\u2019s mess is the latest example of how Waymo is still uncovering unforeseen issues with its software and its approach to designing a reliable fleet of self-driving vehicles. The company already had to ship multiple software updates to make its robotaxis wait for stopped school buses, which prompted a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation and led to a recall.\n\ntitle2:\nWaymo is testing Gemini as an in-car AI assistant in its robotaxis\ndescription2:\nWaymo appears to be testing adding Google\u2019s Gemini AI chatbot to its robotaxis in an effort to integrate an AI assistant that would accompany riders and answer their queries, according to findings by researcher Jane Manchun Wong.\n\u201cWhile digging through Waymo\u2019s mobile app code, I discovered the complete system prompt for its unreleased Gemini integration,\u201d Wong wrote in a blog. \u201cThe document, internally titled \u2018Waymo Ride Assistant Meta-Prompt,\u2019 is a 1,200+ line specification that defines exactly how the AI assistant is expected to behave inside a Waymo vehicle.\u201d\nThe feature hasn\u2019t shipped in public builds, but Wong says the system prompt makes it clear that this is \u201cmore than a simple chatbot.\u201d The assistant is said to have the ability to answer questions, manage certain in-cabin functions like climate control, and, if required, reassure riders.\n\u201cWhile we have no details to share today, our team is always tinkering with features to make riding with Waymo delightful, seamless, and useful,\u201d Julia Ilina, a spokesperson for Waymo, told TechCrunch. \u201cSome of these may or may not come to our rider experience.\u201d\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time Gemini has been integrated into the Alphabet-owned self-driving company\u2019s stack. Waymo says it has used Gemini\u2019s \u201cworld knowledge\u201d to train its autonomous vehicles to navigate complex, rare, and high-stakes scenarios.\nWaymo is working on Gemini AI in-car assistant\nThey tried to hide it from the app, but here\u2019s the full 1200-line system prompt pic.twitter.com/weh1EBPj7y \u2014 Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) December 24, 2025\nWong writes the assistant is instructed to possess a clear identity and purpose: \u201ca friendly and helpful AI companion integrated into a Waymo autonomous vehicle\u201d whose primary goal is \u201cto enhance the rider\u2019s experience by providing useful information and assistance in a safe, reassuring, and unobtrusive manner.\u201d The bot is directed to use clear, simple language and avoid technical jargon, and is instructed to keep its responses succinct to one to three sentences.\nAccording to the system prompts, when a rider activates the assistant via the in-car screen, Gemini can choose from a set of pre-approved greetings personalized with the rider\u2019s first name. The system can also access contextual data about the rider, like how many Waymo trips they\u2019ve been on.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe prompts currently let Gemini access and control in-car features, like the temperature, lighting and music. Notably absent from the function list are volume control, route changes, seat adjustment, and window control, Wong pointed out. If a rider asks for a feature that Gemini can\u2019t control, the bot is to reply with \u201caspirational phrases,\u201d like, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can do yet.\u201d\nInterestingly, the assistant is directed to maintain a clear distinction between its identity as Gemini the AI bot and the autonomous driving technology (the Waymo Driver). So when replying to a question such as, \u201cHow do you see the road?\u201d Gemini shouldn\u2019t say \u201cI use a combination of sensors,\u201d and instead should reply, \u201cThe Waymo Driver uses a combination of sensors\u2026\u201d\nThe system prompts include a range of compelling tidbits, such as how the bot is meant to handle being asked questions about competitors like Tesla or the now-defunct Cruise, or which trigger keywords will get it to stop talking.\nThe assistant is also directed to avoiding speculating on, explaining, confirming, denying, or commenting on real-time driving actions or specific driving events. So if a passenger asks about a video they saw of a Waymo hitting something, the bot is instructed to not answer directly and deflect.\n\u201cYour role is not to be a spokesperson for the driving system\u2019s performance, and you must not adopt a defensive or apologetic tone,\u201d the prompt reads.\nThe in-car assistant is allowed to answer general knowledge questions like about the weather, the height of the Eiffel Tower, what time the local Trader Joe\u2019s closes, and who won the last World Series. It is not allowed to take real-world actions like ordering food, making reservations, or handling emergencies.\nWaymo isn\u2019t the only company integrating AI assistants into driverless vehicles. Tesla is doing something similar with xAI\u2019s Grok. The two different car assistants serve different functions, however. Gemini appears to be programmed to be more pragmatic and ride-focused, while Grok is pitched more as an in-car buddy that can handle long conversations and remember context from previous questions.\n\ntitle3:\nApple pauses app store changes in Texas after court blocks age-assurance law\ndescription3:\nAfter a federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from implementing a new age-verification law for app stores, Apple announced it will pause previously announced plans for the state as it continues to monitor the \u201congoing legal process.\u201d\nApple said its previously announced developer tools for age assurance would remain available for testing and use.\nThe law, SB 2420, or the App Store Accountability Act, would have required app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, to verify user ages and require parental consent for those under 18 to download apps or make purchases. In addition, it would have required the age data be shared with developers.\nA judge, citing First Amendment concerns, blocked the law\u2019s enforcement that was set to take effect in January. The ruling was a win for tech giants and a setback to Texas lawmakers, who said the legal fight will continue. The Texas attorney general\u2019s office noted in a court filing that it plans to appeal the decision, a report from Reuters noted.\nTo comply with the coming law, Apple had announced in October a series of new requirements for apps in Texas, which included all users under the age of 18 would have to join a Family Sharing group, where parents or guardians would provide consent for all App Store downloads, app purchases, and in-app transactions. Parents would be able to revoke their consent for an app at any time.\nApple also said its Declared Age Range API, a technology the company debuted to help it comply with the growing number of age-assurance laws worldwide, would be updated in the months ahead to provide the required age categories for new account users in Texas. Apple had planned to launch new APIs for developers to request parental consent again if their app was significantly updated.\nApple had objected to this law, and similar laws arriving next year in Utah and Louisiana, on the grounds of privacy, not kids\u2019 protection.\n\u201cWhile we share the goal of strengthening kids\u2019 online safety, we are concerned that SB2420 impacts the privacy of users by requiring the collection of sensitive, personally identifiable information to download any app, even if a user simply wants to check the weather or sports scores,\u201d Apple explained in a developer announcement earlier this year.\nApple on Thursday announced other developer tools for complying with new age-assurance laws will remain available for testing, including its Declared Age Range API, Significant Change API under PermissionKit, New age rating property type in StoreKit, and App Store Server Notifications. In addition, the Declared Age Range API is still available worldwide across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26, and later.\n\ntitle4:\nThe year data centers went from backend to center stage\ndescription4:\nThere was a time when most Americans had little to no knowledge about their local data center. Long the invisible but critical backbone of the internet, server farms have rarely been a point of interest for folks outside of the tech industry, let alone an issue of particularly captivating political resonance.\nWell, as of 2025, it would appear those days are officially over.\nOver the past 12 months, data centers have inspired protests in dozens of states, as regional activists have sought to combat America\u2019s ever-increasing compute buildup. Data Center Watch, an organization tracking anti-data center activism, writes that there are currently 142 different activist groups across 24 states that are organizing against data center developments.\nActivists have a variety of concerns: the environmental and potential health impacts of these projects, the controversial ways in which AI is being used, and, most importantly, the fact that so many new additions to America\u2019s power grid may be driving up local electricity bills.\nSuch a sudden populist uprising appears to be a natural response to an industry that has grown so quickly that it\u2019s now showing up in people\u2019s backyards. Indeed, as the AI industry has swelled to dizzying heights, so, too, has the cloud computing business. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data shows that, since 2021, construction spending on data centers has skyrocketed a stunning 331%. Spending on these projects totals in the hundreds of billions of dollars. So many new data centers have been proposed in recent months that many experts believe that a majority of them will not \u2014 and, indeed, could not possibly \u2014 be built.\nThis buildout shows no signs of slowing down in the meantime. Major tech giants \u2014 including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon \u2014 have all announced significant capital expenditure projections for the new year, a majority of which will likely go toward such projects.\nNew AI infrastructure isn\u2019t just being pushed by Silicon Valley but by Washington, D.C., where the Trump administration has made artificial intelligence a central plank of its agenda. The Stargate Project, announced in January, set the stage for 2025\u2019s massive AI infrastructure buildout by heralding a supposed \u201cre-industrialization of the United States.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nIn the process of scaling itself exponentially, an industry that once had little public exposure has suddenly been thrust into the limelight \u2014 and is now suffering backlash. Danny Cendejas, an activist with the nonprofit MediaJustice, has been personally involved in a number of actions against data centers, including a protest that took place in Memphis, Tennessee, earlier this year, where locals came out to decry the expansion of Colossus, a project from Elon Musk\u2019s startup, xAI.\nCendejas told TechCrunch that he meets new people every week who express interest in organizing against a data center in their community. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to stop anytime soon,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to keep building, and we\u2019re going to see more wins \u2014 more projects are going to be stopped.\u201d\nEvidence in support of Cendejas\u2019 assessment is everywhere you look. Across the country, communities have reacted to newly announced server farms in much the same way the average person might react to the presence of a highly contagious plague. In Michigan, for instance, where developers are currently eyeing 16 different locations for potential data center construction, protesters recently descended upon the state\u2019s capitol, saying things like: \u201cMichiganders do not want data centers in our yards, in our communities.\u201d Meanwhile, in Wisconsin \u2014 another development hot spot \u2014 angry locals appear to have recently dissuaded Microsoft from using their town as a headquarters for a new 244-acre data center. In Southern California, the tiny city of Imperial Valley recently filed a lawsuit to overturn its county\u2019s approval of a data center project, expressing environmental concerns as the rationale.\nThe discontent surrounding these projects has gotten so intense that politicians believe it could make or break particular candidates at the ballot box. In November, it was reported that rising electricity costs \u2014 which many believe are being driven by the AI boom \u2014 could become a critical issue that determines the 2026 midterm elections.\n\u201cThe whole connection to everybody\u2019s energy bills going up \u2014 I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really made this an issue that is so stark for people,\u201d Cendejas told TechCrunch. \u201cSo many of us are struggling month to month. Meanwhile, there\u2019s this huge expansion of data centers\u2026[People are wondering] Where is all that money coming from? How are our local governments giving away subsidies and public funds to incentivize these projects, when there\u2019s so much need in our communities?\u201d\nIn some cases, protests appear to be working and even halting (if only temporarily) planned developments. Data Center Watch claims that some $64 billion worth of developments have been blocked or delayed as the result of grassroots opposition. Cendejas is certainly a believer in the idea that organized action can halt companies in their tracks. \u201cAll this public pressure is working,\u201d he said, noting that he could sense a \u201cvery palpable anger\u201d around the issue.\nUnsurprisingly, the tech industry is fighting back. Earlier this month, Politico reported that a relatively new trade group, the National Artificial Intelligence Association (NAIA), has been \u201cdistributing talking points to members of Congress and organizing local data center field trips to better pitch voters on their value.\u201d Tech companies, including Meta, have been taking out ad campaigns to sell voters on the economic benefits of data centers, the outlet wrote. In short: The tech industry\u2019s AI hopes are pegged to a compute buildout of epic proportions, so for now it\u2019s safe to say that in 2026 the server surge will continue, as will the backlash and polarization that surround it.\"\n\nResponse:",
