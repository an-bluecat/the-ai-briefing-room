Along with the model, the company also launched a linked social app called Sora, where users can generate videos of themselves and their friends to share on a TikTok-style algorithmic feed. OpenAI\u2019s work on a new social platform was previously reported by Wired.\nWhile we haven\u2019t been able to test the invite-only app and Sora 2 model ourselves yet, OpenAI has shared impressive examples. In particular, Sora 2 is better at following the laws of physics, making the videos more realistic. OpenAI\u2019s public clips depict a beach volleyball game, skateboard tricks, gymnastics routines, and cannonball jumps from a diving board, among others.\n\u201cPrior video models are overoptimistic \u2014 they will morph objects and deform reality to successfully execute upon a text prompt,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cFor example, if a basketball player misses a shot, the ball may spontaneously teleport to the hoop. In Sora 2, if a basketball player misses a shot, it will rebound off the backboard.\u201d\nThe Sora app comes with an \u201cupload yourself\u201d feature called \u201ccameos,\u201d which allows users to drop themselves into any Sora-generated scenes. In order to use their own likeness in a generated video, users will have to upload a one-time video-and-audio recording to verify their identity and capture their appearance.\nThis feature also allows users to share their \u201ccameos\u201d with their friends, allowing them to give other users permission to include their likeness in videos that they generate, including videos of multiple people together.\n\u201cWe think a social app built around this \u2018cameos\u2019 feature is the best way to experience the magic of Sora 2,\u201d the company wrote.\nThe Sora iOS app is available to download now and will initially roll out in the U.S. and Canada, though OpenAI says it hopes to expand quickly to other countries. While the Sora social platform is currently invite-only, ChatGPT Pro users should be able to try out the Sora 2 Pro model without an invite.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOnce videos are generated, they can be shared in a feed within the Sora app, which seems like it\u2019ll be similar to TikTok, Instagram Reels, or other short-form video feeds. Interestingly, Meta announced just last week that it added a video feed called \u201cVibes\u201d to its Meta AI app (it\u2019s basically all mindless slop).\nTo curate its algorithmic recommendations, OpenAI will consider a user\u2019s Sora activity, their location (attained via their IP address), their past post engagement, and their ChatGPT conversation history, though that can be turned off. The Sora app also ships with parental controls via ChatGPT, which allow parents to override infinite scroll limits, turn off algorithmic personalization, and manage who can direct message their child. However, these features are only as powerful as the parent\u2019s technical know-how.\nThe Sora app will be free at launch, which OpenAI says is \u201cso people can freely explore its capabilities.\u201d The company says that at launch, the only plan for monetization is to charge users to generate extra videos in times of high demand.\nThe launch of a social platform will require significant user safety measures from OpenAI, which has struggled with the same issues in ChatGPT. While users can revoke access to their likeness at any time, this sort of access can easily be abused. Even if a user trusts someone they know with access to their AI likeness, that person could still generate deceptive content that could be used to harm that person. Non-consensual videos are a persistent problem with AI-generated video, causing significant harm with few laws explicitly governing platform responsibility.\n\ntitle1:\nU.S. government takes stake in Canadian lithium miner and its Nevada mining project\ndescription1:\nThe U.S. Department of Energy has taken equity stakes in Canadian company Lithium Americas and its Nevada mining joint venture with General Motors as part of a renegotiation of a federal loan.\nUnder the new terms, the U.S. government will take a 5% equity ownership in Lithium Americas and a 5% ownership in the Lithium Americas-GM joint venture. The equity stakes will be acquired through no-cost warrants, which are financial instruments that give the government the right to purchase shares at a set price. The new terms came out of a renegotiation with the DOE\u2019s Loan Programs Office over a $2.26 billion loan that was awarded to Lithium Americas under the Biden Administration.\nShares of Lithium Americas spiked 34% in after-hours trading.\nThe DOE said the equity stakes will serve as additional collateral on the loan, helping to reduce repayment risk for taxpayers. Lithium is a key chemical element that is used in the batteries of electric vehicles and smartphones.\n\u201cDespite having some of the largest deposits, the United States produces less than 1% percent of the global supply of lithium. Thanks to President Trump\u2019s bold leadership, American lithium production is going to skyrocket,\u201d U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement helps reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries for critical minerals by strengthening domestic supply chains and ensures better stewardship of American taxpayer dollars. President Trump promised to do both and he is delivering.\u201d\nThe announcement Tuesday is the latest action by the Trump administration to take ownership stakes in companies. The Trump administration has announced plans to take a 10% stake in Intel and MP Materials, which operates a rare earth minerals mine in the United States.\nLithium Americas is developing the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, which is expected to produce enough lithium to make as many as 800,000 electric vehicles per year in the first phase. President Trump approved the permit for the project in January 2021, at the end of his first term.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

In total, that would be enough lithium for 1.6 million EVs over the next two decades.\n\ntitle2:\nSpotify's founder and CEO Daniel Ek is stepping down\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nMusic streaming giant Spotify said on Tuesday that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO and will become the company\u2019s executive chairman by the year\u2019s end.\nThe company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs chosen in house: Gustav S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, co-president and chief product and technology officer, and Alex Norstr\u00f6m, co-president and chief business officer.\n\u201cOver the last few years, I\u2019ve turned over a large part of the day-to-day management and strategic direction of Spotify to Alex and Gustav \u2014 who have shaped the company from our earliest days and are now more than ready to guide our next phase,\u201d Ek said in a statement. \u201cThis change simply matches titles to how we already operate. In my role as Executive Chairman, I will focus on the long arc of the company and keep the Board and our co-CEOs deeply connected through my engagement.\u201d\nIn a post on X, Ek also mentioned that Spotify has been profitable for over a year.\nAn update from me \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/xc0w3BWWAO \u2014 Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) September 30, 2025\nEk has served as Spotify\u2019s CEO since he founded it in 2006, so this is a big change in leadership for the streaming giant.\nEk in 2018 also co-founded a body-scanning health startup called Neko, which raised $260 million in Series B funding at a $1.8 billion post-money valuation earlier this year. He also runs an investment company called Prima Materia, which he founded in 2021 alongside Spotify investor Shakil Khan.\n\ntitle3:\nFormer OpenAI and DeepMind researchers raise whopping $300M seed to automate science\ndescription3:\nPeriodic Labs came out of stealth on Tuesday with a war chest of $300 million as a seed round, backed by a tech industry who\u2019s who: Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia, Accel, Elad Gil, Jeff Dean, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Bezos.\nPeriodic Labs was founded by Ekin Dogus Cubuk and Liam Fedus. Cubuk led the materials and chemistry team at Google Brain and DeepMind, where one of his projects was, for instance, an AI tool called GNoME. That tool discovered over 2 million new crystals in 2023, materials that could one day be used to power new generations of technology, researchers say.\nFedus is a former VP of Research at OpenAI, and one of the researchers who helped create ChatGPT. He also led the team that created the first trillion-parameter neural network.\nIts small team is likewise filled with researchers who have worked on other major AI and materials science projects, from building OpenAI\u2019s agent Operator to working on Microsoft\u2019s MatterGen, an LLM materials science discovery AI.\nThe goal of Periodic Labs is nothing less than to automate scientific discovery, creating AI scientists, the company says. This means building labs where robots conduct physical experiments, collect data, iterate, and try again, learning and improving as they go.\nThe lab\u2019s first goal is to invent new superconductors that it hopes perform better and possibly require less energy than existing superconducting materials. But the well-funded startup also hopes to find other new materials.\nAnother goal is to collect all the physical world data that its AI scientists produce as they mix and heat and otherwise manipulate various powers and raw materials in their search for something new.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cUntil now, scientific AI advances have come from models trained on the internet\u201d and LLMs have \u201cexhausted\u201d the internet as a source that can be consumed, the company says in an introductory blog post. \u201c[A]t Periodic, we are building AI scientists and the autonomous laboratories for them to operate.\u201d\nThe hope is that, not only will the labs invent next-generation materials, but they will produce invaluable fresh data that AI models can consume to continue their evolution.\nWhile this might be one of the most impressive groups of researchers to assemble a startup for this purpose, it\u2019s not the only one working on AI scientists. AI as a tool to automate chemistry discoveries has been a topic of academic research since at least 2023. It is the pursuit of tiny startups like Tetsuwan Scientific, as well as nonprofits like Future House and the University of Toronto\u2019s Acceleration Consortium.\n\ntitle4:\nToyota adds another $1.5B to its bet on startups at every stage\ndescription4:\nToyota is looking for the next new thing in mobility, climate, AI, and industrial automation. Its answer is $1.5 billion in new capital that will focus on, and invest in, the life cycle of startups \u2014 from the first seeds of an invention through its growth stage and eventually to mature companies.\nToyota made two related announcements Tuesday that provide a snapshot of the company\u2019s growing interest in the startup ecosystem. It also hints at how those startups, and their inventions, may play a part in Woven City, a prototype city located on a 175-acre site at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan designed to incubate startups and that opened this year.\nThe Japanese automaker said Tuesday it has created a strategic investment subsidiary called Toyota Invention Partners Co. with about $670 million in capital, while its growth-stage venture arm Woven Capital launched a second $800 million fund.\nThe Toyota Invention Partners subsidiary will take a long-term strategy focused on Japan-based startups, eschewing the traditional fixed investment periods found in other funds. Woven Capital general partner George Kellerman described Toyota Invention Partners Co. as a bookend of sorts to the company\u2019s other investment organizations.\n\u201cOne way to think about them (Toyota Invention Partners) is they\u2019re bookending what Toyota Ventures and Woven Capital are doing,\u201d Kellerman said in a phone interview. \u201cThey\u2019re doing the really early stage on one end, but then they\u2019re maybe doing these longer-term project finance, asset management type of infrastructure investments, that might be a 30-, 40-, 50-year type of investment.\u201d\nToyota Invention Partners is at the \u201czero to one\u201d stage, Toyota Ventures covers early-stage, and Woven Capital handles growth stage, he explained. But Toyota Invention Partners may also stick with a startup throughout all of these stages, and if it really scales, it\u2019ll go to the balance sheet of Toyota, Kellerman added.\nKellerman said the two announcements reflect Toyota\u2019s interest in startups \u2014 and the tech and innovation that is coming out of them.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Machina Labs, a Los Angeles-based advanced manufacturing startup that combines AI and robotics to rapidly produce metal structures, announced a strategic investment from Woven Capital and a pilot project with Toyota Motor North America. The automaker will test Machina Labs\u2019 manufacturing technology to produce automotive body panels and accessories. Woven Capital and Machina Labs didn\u2019t disclose the investment amount or terms.\nWoven Capital, which launched in 2021 with an $800 million fund, is still focused on investing in global startups that are entering into a growth stage. The firm has invested in 18 companies from the first fund, including Foretellix and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro. It will continue to pull capital from the first fund to support follow-on investments.\nThis second fund, which is also $800 million, will target 20 to 25 new investments in Series B to late-stage companies working on advancing AI, automation, climate technology, energy, sustainability, and more. As part of the new fund announcement, Woven Capital has also been made a wholly owned subsidiary of Toyota.\"\n\nResponse:",
