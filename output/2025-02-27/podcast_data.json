You can find a link to the old white paper here. The original article follows.\nOpenAI announced on Thursday it is launching GPT-4.5, the much-anticipated AI model code-named Orion. GPT-4.5 is OpenAI\u2019s largest model to date, trained using more computing power and data than any of the company\u2019s previous releases.\nDespite its size, OpenAI notes in a white paper that it does not consider GPT-4.5 to be a frontier model.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT Pro, OpenAI\u2019s $200-a-month plan, will gain access to GPT-4.5 in ChatGPT starting Thursday as part of a research preview. Developers on paid tiers of OpenAI\u2019s API will also be able to use GPT-4.5 starting today. As for other ChatGPT users, customers signed up for ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Team should get the model sometime next week, an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nThe industry has held its collective breath for Orion, which some consider to be a bellwether for the viability of traditional AI training approaches. GPT-4.5 was developed using the same key technique \u2014 dramatically increasing the amount of computing power and data during a \u201cpre-training\u201d phase called unsupervised learning \u2014 that OpenAI used to develop GPT-4, GPT-3, GPT-2, and GPT-1.\nIn every GPT generation before GPT-4.5, scaling up led to massive jumps in performance across domains, including mathematics, writing, and coding. Indeed, OpenAI says that GPT-4.5\u2019s increased size has given it \u201ca deeper world knowledge\u201d and \u201chigher emotional intelligence.\u201d However, there are signs that the gains from scaling up data and computing are beginning to level off. On several AI benchmarks, GPT-4.5 falls short of newer AI \u201creasoning\u201d models from Chinese AI company DeepSeek, Anthropic, and OpenAI itself.\nGPT-4.5 is also very expensive to run, OpenAI admits \u2014 so expensive that the company says it\u2019s evaluating whether to continue serving GPT-4.5 in its API in the long term. To access GPT-4.5\u2019s API, OpenAI is charging developers $75 for every million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words) and $150 for every million output tokens. Compare that to GPT-4o, which costs just $2.50 per million input tokens and $10 per million output tokens.\n\u201cWe\u2019re sharing GPT\u20104.5 as a research preview to better understand its strengths and limitations,\u201d said OpenAI in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re still exploring what it\u2019s capable of and are eager to see how people use it in ways we might not have expected.\u201d\nMixed performance\nOpenAI emphasizes that GPT-4.5 is not meant to be a drop-in replacement for GPT-4o, the company\u2019s workhorse model that powers most of its API and ChatGPT. While GPT-4.5 supports features like file and image uploads and ChatGPT\u2019s canvas tool, it currently lacks capabilities like support for ChatGPT\u2019s realistic two-way voice mode.\nIn the plus column, GPT-4.5 is more performant than GPT-4o \u2014 and many other models besides.\nOn OpenAI\u2019s SimpleQA benchmark, which tests AI models on straightforward, factual questions, GPT-4.5 outperforms GPT-4o and OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models, o1 and o3-mini, in terms of accuracy. According to OpenAI, GPT-4.5 hallucinates less frequently than most models, which in theory means it should be less likely to make stuff up.\nOpenAI did not list one of its top-performing AI reasoning models, deep research, on SimpleQA. An OpenAI spokesperson tells TechCrunch it has not publicly reported deep research\u2019s performance on this benchmark and claimed it\u2019s not a relevant comparison. Notably, AI startup Perplexity\u2019s Deep Research model, which performs similarly on other benchmarks to OpenAI\u2019s deep research, outperforms GPT-4.5 on this test of factual accuracy.\nSimpleQA benchmarks. Image Credits:OpenAI\nOn a subset of coding problems, the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark, GPT-4.5 roughly matches the performance of GPT-4o and o3-mini but falls short of OpenAI\u2019s deep research and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. On another coding test, OpenAI\u2019s SWE-Lancer benchmark, which measures an AI model\u2019s ability to develop full software features, GPT-4.5 outperforms GPT-4o and o3-mini, but falls short of deep research.\nOpenAI\u2019s Swe-Bench verified benchmark. Image Credits:OpenAI\nOpenAI\u2019s SWe-Lancer Diamond benchmark. Image Credits:OpenAI\nGPT-4.5 doesn\u2019t quite reach the performance of leading AI reasoning models such as o3-mini, DeepSeek\u2019s R1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (technically a hybrid model) on difficult academic benchmarks such as AIME and GPQA. But GPT-4.5 matches or bests leading non-reasoning models on those same tests, suggesting that the model performs well on math- and science-related problems.\nOpenAI also claims that GPT-4.5 is qualitatively superior to other models in areas that benchmarks don\u2019t capture well, like the ability to understand human intent. GPT-4.5 responds in a warmer and more natural tone, OpenAI says, and performs well on creative tasks such as writing and design.\nIn one informal test, OpenAI prompted GPT-4.5 and two other models, GPT-4o and o3-mini, to create a unicorn in SVG, a format for displaying graphics based on mathematical formulas and code. GPT-4.5 was the only AI model to create anything resembling a unicorn.\nleft: GPT-4.5, Middle: GPT-4o, RIGHT: o3-mini. Image Credits:OpenAI\nIn another test, OpenAI asked GPT-4.5 and the other two models to respond to the prompt, \u201cI\u2019m going through a tough time after failing a test.\u201d GPT-4o and o3-mini gave helpful information, but GPT-4.5\u2019s response was the most socially appropriate.\n\u201c[W]e look forward to gaining a more complete picture of GPT-4.5\u2019s capabilities through this release,\u201d OpenAI wrote in the blog post, \u201cbecause we recognize academic benchmarks don\u2019t always reflect real-world usefulness.\u201d\nGPT-4.5\u2019s emotional intelligence in action. Image Credits:OpenAI\nScaling laws challenged\nOpenAI claims that GPT\u20104.5 is \u201cat the frontier of what is possible in unsupervised learning.\u201d That may be true, but the model\u2019s limitations also appear to confirm speculation from experts that pre-training \u201cscaling laws\u201d won\u2019t continue to hold.\nOpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever said in December that \u201cwe\u2019ve achieved peak data\u201d and that \u201cpre-training as we know it will unquestionably end.\u201d His comments echoed concerns that AI investors, founders, and researchers shared with TechCrunch for a feature in November.\nIn response to the pre-training hurdles, the industry \u2014 including OpenAI \u2014 has embraced reasoning models, which take longer than non-reasoning models to perform tasks but tend to be more consistent. By increasing the amount of time and computing power that AI reasoning models use to \u201cthink\u201d through problems, AI labs are confident they can significantly improve models\u2019 capabilities.\nOpenAI plans to eventually combine its GPT series of models with its \u201co\u201d reasoning series, beginning with GPT-5 later this year. GPT-4.5, which reportedly was incredibly expensive to train, delayed several times, and failed to meet internal expectations, may not take the AI benchmark crown on its own. But OpenAI likely sees it as a steppingstone toward something far more powerful.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta fires around 20 employees for leaking confidential information\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMeta has fired \u201croughly\u201d 20 employees for leaking confidential information, The Verge reports.\n\u201cWe tell employees when they join the company, and we offer periodic reminders, that it is against our policies to leak internal information, no matter the intent,\u201d Meta told the publication. \u201cWe recently conducted an investigation that resulted in roughly 20 employees being terminated for sharing confidential information outside the company, and we expect there will be more. We take this seriously, and will continue to take action when we identify leaks.\u201d\nThe move comes in response to a surge of news stories that shared leaked details about Meta\u2019s internal meetings and undisclosed product plans, including a recent all-hands led by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Following the leaks, Meta warned employees that leakers would be fired.\nIn comments that were later leaked about these warnings, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth told employees that the company was close to catching the culprits.\n\ntitle2:\nWaymo has doubled its weekly robotaxi rides in less than a year\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nWaymo is logging more than 200,000 paid robotaxi rides every week, according to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, who shared the stat about the tech giant\u2019s subsidiary on X.\nWaymo commercially operates robotaxis in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Phoenix.\nThe 200,000-weekly trips milestone is notable for a company that was providing only 10,000 rides a week two years ago. As Pichai notes, the number of weekly paid rides has grown 20-fold in the past two years. In August, the company was providing 100,000 weekly paid robotaxi rides.\nAccording to Waymo, the company\u2019s self-driving system drives more than 1 million miles each week. Those numbers will grow this year as the company launches commercial robotaxi services in Austin and Atlanta in 2025 in partnership with Uber. Waymo is also expected to begin a commercial robotaxi service in Miami in early 2026.\nWaymo\u2019s current operations and future growth plans put it far ahead of other AV competitors \u2014 at least in terms of its commercial robotaxi footprint. Cruise has ended its robotaxi program, leaving Zoox as a primary remaining rival. Zoox started rolling out its custom-built robotaxis in San Francisco and Las Vegas; however, it is not yet operating commercially.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the company is 'out of GPUs'\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the company was forced to stagger the rollout of its newest model, GPT-4.5, because OpenAI is \u201cout of GPUs.\u201d\nIn a post on X, Altman said that GPT-4.5, which he described as \u201cgiant\u201d and \u201cexpensive,\u201d will require \u201ctens of thousands\u201d more GPUs before additional ChatGPT users can gain access. GPT-4.5 will come first to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro starting Thursday, followed by ChatGPT Plus customers next week.\nPerhaps in part due to its enormous size, GPT-4.5 is wildly expensive. OpenAI is charging $75 per million tokens (~750,000 words) fed into the model and $150 per million tokens generated by the model. That\u2019s 30x the input cost and 15x the output cost of OpenAI\u2019s workhorse GPT-4o model.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been growing a lot and are out of GPUs,\u201d Altman wrote. \u201cWe will add tens of thousands of GPUs next week and roll it out to the Plus tier then \u2026 This isn\u2019t how we want to operate, but it\u2019s hard to perfectly predict growth surges that lead to GPU shortages.\u201d\nAltman has previously said that a lack of computing capacity is delaying the company\u2019s products. OpenAI hopes to combat this in the coming years by developing its own AI chips and by building a massive network of data centers.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta is reportedly planning a standalone AI chatbot app\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nMeta reportedly plans to release a standalone app for its AI assistant, Meta AI, in a bid to better compete with AI-powered chatbots like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\nAccording to CNBC, Meta could launch a standalone Meta AI app as soon as the company\u2019s next fiscal quarter (April-June). Meta AI is currently only available to users via a website and Meta\u2019s family of apps, including Facebook and WhatsApp.\nMeta also plans to test a paid subscription service for Meta AI that\u2019ll add unspecified capabilities to the assistant, per CNBC. The publication wasn\u2019t able to learn the price.\nMeta AI, which has over 700 million active monthly users, is a part of Meta\u2019s multi-pronged strategy to become a dominant force in the AI space. The company has also aggressively released \u201copen\u201d models like Llama, which it believes could foster an ecosystem rivaling that of OpenAI\u2019s.\nMeta plans to host its first-ever AI-focused developer conference, LlamaCon, in late April.\"\n\nResponse:",
