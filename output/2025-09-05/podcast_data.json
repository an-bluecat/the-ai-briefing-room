Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed these changes to TechCrunch.\nThe Model Behavior team\u2019s founding leader, Joanne Jang, is also moving on to start a new project at the company. In an interview with TechCrunch, Jang says she\u2019s building out a new research team called OAI Labs, which will be responsible for \u201cinventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with AI.\u201d\nThe Model Behavior team has become one of OpenAI\u2019s key research groups, responsible for shaping the personality of the company\u2019s AI models and for reducing sycophancy \u2014 which occurs when AI models simply agree with and reinforce user beliefs, even unhealthy ones, rather than offering balanced responses. The team has also worked on navigating political bias in model responses and helped OpenAI define its stance on AI consciousness.\nIn the memo to staff, Chen said that now is the time to bring the work of OpenAI\u2019s Model Behavior team closer to core model development. By doing so, the company is signaling that the \u201cpersonality\u201d of its AI is now considered a critical factor in how the technology evolves.\nIn recent months, OpenAI has faced increased scrutiny over the behavior of its AI models. Users strongly objected to personality changes made to GPT-5, which the company said exhibited lower rates of sycophancy but seemed colder to some users. This led OpenAI to restore access to some of its legacy models, such as GPT-4o, and to release an update to make the newer GPT-5 responses feel \u201cwarmer and friendlier\u201d without increasing sycophancy.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOpenAI and all AI model developers have to walk a fine line to make their AI chatbots friendly to talk to but not sycophantic. In August, the parents of a 16-year-old boy sued OpenAI over ChatGPT\u2019s alleged role in their son\u2019s suicide. The boy, Adam Raine, confided some of his suicidal thoughts and plans to ChatGPT (specifically a version powered by GPT-4o), according to court documents, in the months leading up to his death. The lawsuit alleges that GPT-4o failed to push back on his suicidal ideations.\nThe Model Behavior team has worked on every OpenAI model since GPT-4, including GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, and GPT-5. Before starting the unit, Jang previously worked on projects such as Dall-E 2, OpenAI\u2019s early image-generation tool.\nJang announced in a post on X last week that she\u2019s leaving the team to \u201cbegin something new at OpenAI.\u201d The former head of Model Behavior has been with OpenAI for nearly four years.\nJang told TechCrunch she will serve as the general manager of OAI Labs, which will report to Chen for now. However, it\u2019s early days, and it\u2019s not clear yet what those novel interfaces will be, she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to explore patterns that move us beyond the chat paradigm, which is currently associated more with companionship, or even agents, where there\u2019s an emphasis on autonomy,\u201d said Jang. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of [AI systems] as instruments for thinking, making, playing, doing, learning, and connecting.\u201d\n\ud83e\uddea i\u2019m starting oai labs: a research-driven group focused on inventing and prototyping new interfaces for how people collaborate with ai.\ni\u2019m excited to explore patterns that move us beyond chat or even agents \u2014 toward new paradigms and instruments for thinking, making,\u2026 \u2014 Joanne Jang (@joannejang) September 5, 2025\nWhen asked whether OAI Labs will collaborate on these novel interfaces with former Apple design chief Jony Ive \u2014 who\u2019s now working with OpenAI on a family of AI hardware devices \u2014 Jang said she\u2019s open to lots of ideas. However, she said she\u2019ll likely start with research areas she\u2019s more familiar with.\nThis story was updated to include a link to Jang\u2019s post announcing her new position, which was released after this story published. We also clarify the models that OpenAI\u2019s Model Behavior team worked on.\n\ntitle1:\nAttorneys general warn OpenAI \u2018harm to children will not be tolerated\u2019\ndescription1:\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings met with and sent an open letter to OpenAI to express their concerns over the safety of ChatGPT, particularly for children and teens.\nThe warning comes a week after Bonta and 44 other attorneys general sent a letter to 12 of the top AI companies, following reports of sexually inappropriate interactions between AI chatbots and children.\n\u201cSince the issuance of that letter, we learned of the heartbreaking death by suicide of one young Californian after he had prolonged interactions with an OpenAI chatbot, as well as a similarly disturbing murder-suicide in Connecticut,\u201d Bonta and Jennings write. \u201cWhatever safeguards were in place did not work.\u201d\nThe two state officials are currently investigating OpenAI\u2019s proposed restructuring into a for-profit entity to ensure that the mission of the nonprofit remains intact. That mission \u201cincludes ensuring that artificial intelligence is deployed safely\u201d and building artificial general intelligence (AGI) to benefit all humanity, \u201cincluding children,\u201d per the letter.\n\u201cBefore we get to benefiting, we need to ensure that adequate safety measures are in place to not harm,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cIt is our shared view that OpenAI and the industry at large are not where they need to be in ensuring safety in AI products\u2019 development and deployment. As Attorneys General, public safety is one of our core missions. As we continue our dialogue related to OpenAI\u2019s recapitalization plan, we must work to accelerate and amplify safety as a governing force in the future of this powerful technology.\u201d\nBonta and Jennings have asked for more information about OpenAI\u2019s current safety precautions and governance, and said they expect the company to take immediate remedial measures where appropriate.\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle Gemini dubbed 'high risk' for kids and teens in new safety assessment\ndescription2:\nCommon Sense Media, a kids-safety-focused nonprofit offering ratings and reviews of media and technology, released its risk assessment of Google\u2019s Gemini AI products on Friday. While the organization found that Google\u2019s AI clearly told kids it was a computer, not a friend \u2014 something that\u2019s associated with helping drive delusional thinking and psychosis in emotionally vulnerable individuals \u2014 it did suggest that there was room for improvement across several other fronts.\nNotably, Common Sense said that Gemini\u2019s \u201cUnder 13\u201d and \u201cTeen Experience\u201d tiers both appeared to be the adult versions of Gemini under the hood, with only some additional safety features added on top. The organization believes that for AI products to truly be safer for kids, they should be built with child safety in mind from the ground up.\nFor example, its analysis found that Gemini could still share \u201cinappropriate and unsafe\u201d material with children, which they may not be ready for, including information related to sex, drugs, alcohol, and other unsafe mental health advice.\nThe latter could be of particular concern to parents, as AI has reportedly played a role in some teen suicides in recent months. OpenAI is facing its first wrongful death lawsuit after a 16-year-old boy died by suicide after allegedly consulting with ChatGPT for months about his plans, having successfully bypassed the chatbot\u2019s safety guardrails. Previously, the AI companion maker Character.AI was also sued over a teen user\u2019s suicide.\nIn addition, the analysis comes as news leaks indicate that Apple is considering Gemini as the LLM (large language model) that will help to power its forthcoming AI-enabled Siri, due out next year. This could expose more teens to risks, unless Apple mitigates the safety concerns somehow.\nCommon Sense also said that Gemini\u2019s products for kids and teens ignored how younger users needed different guidance and information than older ones. As a result, both were labeled as \u201cHigh Risk\u201d in the overall rating, despite the filters added for safety.\n\u201cGemini gets some basics right, but it stumbles on the details,\u201d Common Sense Media Senior Director of AI Programs Robbie Torney said in a statement about the new assessment viewed by TechCrunch. \u201cAn AI platform for kids should meet them where they are, not take a one-size-fits-all approach to kids at different stages of development. For AI to be safe and effective for kids, it must be designed with their needs and development in mind, not just a modified version of a product built for adults,\u201d Torney added.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nGoogle pushed back against the assessment, while noting that its safety features were improving.\nThe company told TechCrunch it has specific policies and safeguards in place for users under 18 to help prevent harmful outputs and that it red-teams and consults with outside experts to improve its protections. However, it also admitted that some of Gemini\u2019s responses weren\u2019t working as intended, so it added additional safeguards to address those concerns.\nThe company pointed out (as Common Sense had also noted) that it does have safeguards to prevent its models from engaging in conversations that could give the semblance of real relationships. Plus, Google suggested that Common Sense\u2019s report seemed to have referenced features that weren\u2019t available to users under 18, but it didn\u2019t have access to the questions the organization used in its tests to be sure.\nCommon Sense Media has previously performed other assessments of AI services, including those from OpenAI, Perplexity, Claude, Meta AI, and more. It found that Meta AI and Character.AI were \u201cunacceptable\u201d \u2014 meaning the risk was severe, not just high. Perplexity was deemed high risk, ChatGPT was labeled \u201cmoderate,\u201d and Claude (targeted at users 18 and up) was found to be a minimal risk.\n\ntitle3:\nRoblox announces short-form video feed for gameplay clips, new AI tools for creators, and more\ndescription3:\nOnline gaming platform Roblox is launching a TikTok-like short-form video feed for sharing gameplay moments, the company unveiled on Friday at the Roblox Developers Conference. The company also announced increased earnings for creators, new AI tools to boost creation, and other advancements in performance.\nThe new short-form video experience, called \u201cRoblox Moments,\u201d is launching in beta for users 13 and older. It allows users to capture clips of their gameplay, then edit and share those clips in a scrollable feed. Users can trim their clip to up to 30 seconds, add music, and write a description before sharing it.\nPlus, users can scroll through a feed of gameplay moments shared by the Roblox community, react to the clips using emojis, and jump into an experience right from a video.\nLater this year, Roblox plans to open up API-based capabilities for creators to allow them to build their own in-game creation and discovery systems. For example, creators will be able to showcase trending clips and highlights from their own gameplay and create leaderboards for things like the coolest overtakes in a racing game.\nImage Credits:Roblox\nRoblox says a gradual rollout of the feature will allow it to test and refine moderation to ensure all content is age-appropriate. All content is subject to moderation before posting, and users can report inappropriate videos.\nAs for the increased earnings for creators, Roblox is increasing the DevEx (Developer Exchange) rate, allowing creators to earn 8.5% more when they convert their earned Robux into cash. Now, 100,000 earned Robux will equal $380, rather than $350 when converted to cash.\n\u201cThis is a significant step that reinforces the company\u2019s dedication to fostering an economy where more creators can thrive and succeed,\u201d the company shared with TechCrunch. \u201cFor example, the average revenue for a Top 1000 developer was almost $1 million, up 2.9x since 2020.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIn terms of the new AI tools for creators, Roblox is launching a series of new updates that are designed to offer artistic freedom, enhanced functionality, and smarter development assistance, it says.\nCreators will be able to move beyond generating static 3D objects thanks to a new way of generating fully functional objects, starting with select vehicles and weapons categories. For example, a creator could provide the prompt \u201ca sleek, futuristic red sports car,\u201d and Roblox will generate an interactive car that can be driven. From there, creators can alter the car to their liking, such as allowing the doors of the car to open.\nImage Credits:Roblox\nAdditionally, Roblox\u2019s new real-time voice chat translation capability will instantly translate voice chat into the listener\u2019s native tongue starting next year for players speaking English, Spanish, French, and German.\nRoblox also announced new text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs to allow creators to build more immersive and interactive experiences.\nThe text-to-speech API enables instant narration and character dialogue with 10 customizable English voice presets (with more coming soon), like a nonplayable character (NPC) giving directions. The speech-to-text API supports voice commands, allowing gameplay actions like firing a cannon when a player says, \u201cFire!\u201d\nRoblox also announced new advancements in performance and fidelity, including a new mode called \u201cServer Authority\u201d that reduces in-game cheating and makes in-game physics interactions more realistic. Plus, avatars will soon have more lifelike motion, including running, climbing, and vaulting over obstacles with natural momentum. There will also be improvements in complex actions for avatars, like grasping items with fingers.\nIn addition, Roblox plans to launch improvements that will allow its platform to run at a higher fidelity across devices without requiring additional effort from creators or sacrificing performance.\nThe updates announced on Friday follow Roblox\u2019s recent announcement that it\u2019s expanding its age-estimation technology to all users and partnering with the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) to introduce age and content ratings for games and apps on its platform. These developments come amid ongoing lawsuits over child safety concerns.\n\ntitle4:\nTesla's ad spend on X has shrunk to almost nothing\ndescription4:\nTesla spent $400,000 advertising on Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform X in 2024, according to a new regulatory filing. But the automaker appears to be on track to spend just a fraction of that in 2025 as sales have struggled.\nIn the first two months of 2025, Tesla spent $10,000 on X ads, putting it on track to spend only $60,000 annually unless it radically increases its advertising for the remainder of the year. During the same time period last year, it had already spent $200,000 on X, Tesla disclosed. Tesla\u2019s spending slowed considerably after those first two months, paying another $200,000 across the remainder of 2024.\nTesla never used to advertise. It wasn\u2019t until CEO Elon Musk gave in to shareholder pressure in 2023 that he said his company would try it out. Ads for the company\u2019s cars started showing up in Google results and on YouTube in late 2023 and early 2024, and also on X.\nIt\u2019s unclear if spending has picked up on X since February, though Google\u2019s Ads Transparency database shows Tesla still has around 700 active advertisements across Google\u2019s properties like Search and YouTube. The company did not respond to a request for comment.\nElsewhere in Musk world, Tesla disclosed that it paid SpaceX around $800,000 for the use of one of the rocket company\u2019s private jets \u2014 an agreement that Musk usually takes great advantage of in order to shuttle around the headquarters of the various companies he oversees. That said, even that expense seems to be on track to be reduced in 2025. Tesla only paid SpaceX around $40,000 through February 2025 for the use of the jet.\nProtecting Musk during all that travel is not cheap, either. Tesla revealed in the proxy that it paid a security company owned by Musk $2.8 million in 2024 \u2014 an increase from the $2.4 million it paid when it first engaged the security company in 2023. That security company earned $500,000 from Tesla through February 2025, and like last year, the automaker notes that this only represents a \u201cportion of the total cost of security services concerning Mr. Musk.\u201d\nBut the biggest transaction between Musk companies last year came from xAI, which actually paid Tesla $198.3 million. Nearly all of that was for Tesla\u2019s Megapack battery storage products, which xAI is using at its data center in Tennessee. xAI paid Tesla another $36.8 million for Megapack products through the first two months of this year, too.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
