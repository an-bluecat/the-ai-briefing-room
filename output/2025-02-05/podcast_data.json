Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday February 6), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAlphabet shares fall 7% on revenue miss, heightened AI investments\ndescription0:\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at Google I/O. At the developer conference, everything revolved around the topic of artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlphabet shares dropped 7.2% on Wednesday after the search giant fell short of Wall Street's fourth-quarter revenue expectations and announced big spending plans for its ongoing artificial intelligence buildout.\nThe stock registered its worst session since January 2024.\nThe company topped earnings estimates by 2 cents per share. Revenue came in at $96.47 billion, behind the $96.56 billion expected by LSEG. Alphabet's revenue grew 12% overall from a year ago, while its YouTube advertising business, search business and services segment slowed year over year.\nAlphabet also said it plans to spend $75 billion on capital expenditures as it builds out its AI offerings and races against megacap rivals to build out data centers and new infrastructure. The figure was much higher than the $58.84 billion expected by Wall Street analysts, according to FactSet.\nFinance chief Anat Ashkenazi said the higher expenses will help \"support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind.\" She also said the spending will go toward \"technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking.\"\n\ntitle1:\nThe biggest breach of US government data is under way\ndescription1:\nOperatives working for Elon Musk have gained unprecedented access to a swath of U.S. government departments \u2014 including agencies responsible for managing data on millions of federal employees and a system that handles $6 trillion in payments to Americans.\nDuring the past two weeks, Musk\u2019s group of representatives \u2014 a presidential advisory board within the Trump administration known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 have taken control of top federal departments and datasets, despite questions about their security clearances, their cybersecurity practices, and the legality of Musk\u2019s activities.\nWhether a feat or a coup (which depends entirely on your point of view), a small group of mostly young, private-sector employees from Musk\u2019s businesses and associates \u2014 many with no prior government experience \u2014 can now view and, in some cases, control the federal government\u2019s most sensitive data held on millions of Americans and the nation\u2019s closest allies.\nThe access by Musk\u2019s DOGE team represents the widest-known compromise of federal government-held data by a private group of individuals \u2014 and little has gotten in their way.\nDOGE has acknowledged few details about its ongoing activities. That task has been left to the media, which has reported questionable cybersecurity practices and the breakdown in long-standing cybersecurity norms that risk sensitive government data from being accessed by nefarious actors.\nMuch of DOGE\u2019s work is avoiding oversight and transparency, leaving open questions around whether cybersecurity and privacy practices are being followed. It\u2019s unclear whether DOGE staffers are following the procedures to keep this data from being accessed by other people, or if any other steps are being taken to protect the sensitive data on Americans.\nSo far, the evidence suggests that security is not top of mind.\nFor example, a DOGE staffer reportedly used a personal Gmail account to access a government call, and a newly filed lawsuit by federal whistleblowers claims DOGE ordered an unauthorized email server be connected to the government network, which violates federal privacy law.\nWhether DOGE staffers are bad actors misses part of the point. Acts of subterfuge, espionage, or ignorance could produce the same suboptimal outcome: exposure or loss of the nation\u2019s sensitive datasets.\nFor now, it\u2019s worth looking at how we got here.\nQuestionable security clearances\nThe ease in which DOGE took over the departments and their vast stores of Americans\u2019 data took career officials and U.S. lawmakers by surprise, who continue to seek answers from the Trump administration.\nMusk\u2019s efforts to take control of the nation\u2019s data stores also privately alarmed cybersecurity professionals, some of whom have spent their careers in government dedicated to securing Americans\u2019 most sensitive systems and data.\nQuestions remain about what level of security clearance the DOGE staff have and whether their interim security clearance gives them the authority to demand access to restricted federal systems. On returning to office, Trump signed an executive order allowing administration officials to grant \u201ctop secret\u201d and compartmentalized security clearance to individuals on an interim basis with little to no substantial vetting, a sharp departure from long-established protocols.\nA security guard stands at the entrance to the USAID headquarters on February 3, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Image Credits:Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images\nThe confusion over DOGE staff clearances has led to brief standoffs between several career officials at federal departments in recent days. At the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), senior officials were put on leave after standing in the way of DOGE staff to protect classified information, according to the Associated Press. DOGE subsequently gained access to the classified facility at USAID, which reportedly contained intelligence reports.\nKatie Miller, an adviser for DOGE, said in a post on X that no classified material was accessed by DOGE \u201cwithout proper security clearances,\u201d though details of the team\u2019s clearance remains unspecified, including how many people were granted the interim secret clearances.\nSeveral senior lawmakers of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said Wednesday that they were still seeking answers about DOGE and what clearance its members have.\n\u201cNo information has been provided to Congress or the public as to who has been formally hired under DOGE, under what authority or regulations DOGE is operating, or how DOGE is vetting and monitoring its staff and representatives before providing them seemingly unfettered access to classified materials and Americans\u2019 personal information,\u201d the senators wrote.\nDOGE\u2019s takeover of government\nWithin a week of President Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 and his executive order establishing DOGE \u2014 Musk\u2019s staffers began infiltrating a variety of federal agencies. The U.S. Treasury\u2019s sensitive payments systems, which contain personal information of millions of Americans who receive payments from the government, from tax refunds to Social Security checks, was among the first.\nDOGE has also gained access to the Office of Personnel Management, the government\u2019s human resources department that includes databases on the personal information of all federal workers, and USAJOBS, which has data on applicants who applied for a federal job.\nOfficials at the OPM said they had no visibility or oversight into Musk\u2019s team\u2019s access to its systems. \u201cIt creates real cybersecurity and hacking implications,\u201d they told Reuters.\nDOGE\u2019s activity has led to widespread opposition, including from some Republicans.\nSenator Ron Wyden (D-OR), who serves as the most senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, called Musk\u2019s access to sensitive federal payments systems a national security risk, given the conflict of interest over his extensive business operations in China. A group of senior Democrats later said in a letter to the Treasury that DOGE\u2019s access to sensitive government data \u201ccould irreparably damage national security.\u201d\nIn a post on Bluesky, former Republican strategist Stuart Stevens called the takeover of the Treasury\u2019s systems \u201cthe most significant data leak in cyber history,\u201d adding: \u201cPrivate individuals in the data business now have access to your Social Security information.\u201d\nSeveral Democratic senators and others outside the U.S. Treasury Department to protest Elon Musk. Image Credits:Anna Rose Layden / Getty Images\nThe Treasury defended its move to grant access to the department\u2019s sensitive payments systems, confirming in an unattributed response to Democratic lawmakers that Musk\u2019s DOGE team has access to the Treasury\u2019s banks of personal information on Americans. The letter confirms Tom Krause, the chief executive of Cloud Software Group, which owns Citrix and several other technology companies, is now a Treasury employee. Krause has not returned a request for comment.\nDOGE has since gained access to multiple sensitive internal systems at the Department of Education, including datasets containing the personal information on millions of students enrolled in financial aid. DOGE staff also demanded \u201caccess to all\u201d systems at the Small Business Administration, including contracts, payments, and human resources information.\nMusk\u2019s team also reportedly has access to payment systems within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and access to data at the U.S. agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid. DOGE is also accessing personnel systems at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and plans to access systems at the Department of Transportation.\nDomestic and global ramifications\nThere are untold security risks that come from granting access to the inner data core of the U.S. government to a group of unelected and private individuals with spurious vetting.\nTo name just a couple of things that could go wrong: Accessing the government network from a non-approved computer harboring malware can compromise other devices on the federal network and allow the theft of sensitive government information, regardless of whether it is classified. And the mishandling of personal information on devices or cloud environments that have not met the standards of the government\u2019s top security specifications, or use the strongest security controls, puts that data at risk of further compromise or leak.\nThese are not unlikely scenarios; these kinds of breaches happen all the time.\nLast year alone saw some of the biggest data breaches in history caused by malicious access gained through the personal devices of company employees, who accidentally installed malware by downloading knock-off software onto their personal computers and not using proper security protections like multi-factor authentication. Any compromise of the team\u2019s credentials or access, or any improper handling of sensitive databases could result in the irretrievable loss, theft, or misplacement of sensitive government data.\nPerhaps most troubling is DOGE, and its activities, are operating outside of public scrutiny.\nOfficials and lawmakers tasked with government oversight reportedly have no insight into what data DOGE has access to within the government or what its cybersecurity controls or protections are \u2014 if any at all. The departmental professionals who have spent much of their careers protecting access to the data stored in these systems cannot do much but stand by and watch as private individuals with little to no prior government experience raid their most sensitive datasets.\nTechnology and privacy lawyer Cathy Gellis, writing in Techdirt, argues Musk and his DOGE team are likely \u201cpersonally liable\u201d under the U.S. federal hacking law, known as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which covers the accessing of federal systems without the proper authorization. A court would still ultimately have to determine DOGE\u2019s activity as \u201cunauthorized access\u201d and therefore illegal, wrote Gellis.\nThere is also the question of how U.S. state governments will respond to the compromise of their residents\u2019 data at the federal level. U.S. states have data breach laws requiring the protection of their citizens\u2019 data, even if the federal government does not. Whether Musk\u2019s team\u2019s access to federal systems sparks legal action from the states remains to be seen.\nThe access also puts relationships with the United States and its diplomatic allies on shaky ground. Allied nations may not want to share intelligence with the U.S. government if they think the information could leak, spill into the public domain, or otherwise get lost as a result of the breakdown in cybersecurity practices aimed at protecting sensitive information.\nIn reality, the cybersecurity consequences of DOGE\u2019s ongoing access to federal departments and datasets may not be known for some time.\nContact Zack Whittaker on Signal and WhatsApp at +1 646-755-8849.

Discovery (WBD) for what it claimed was a willful circumvention of its IP rights.\nAccording to Alcon\u2019s complaint, Musk and WBD asked to use imagery from \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d to promote Tesla\u2019s futuristic concept cars hours before their unveiling on a Warner studio lot. When Alcon wouldn\u2019t agree to provide the rights through WBD, the suit alleges that Tesla, at Musk\u2019s direction, sourced that imagery as raw material to duplicate it using an AI model. No specific AI model is named in the suit (yet).\nMusk then showed this allegedly fake \u201cBlade Runner\u201d imagery during the event while talking about the film itself.\nAlcon also claims in its complaint that it was never made privy to any of the agreements between Tesla and WBD that would\u2019ve been necessary before Tesla\u2019s presser. The production company\u2019s suit proposes banning Tesla from further distributing the disputed promotional materials, as well as unspecified damages \u2014 although the complaint also notes that infringements under the U.S. Copyright Act can be up to $150,000 per violation, and it provides a further cost estimation that is higher:\n\u201cBased on past actual brand affiliation contracts for automotive partners on BR2049 [BladeRunner 2049], Tesla likely would have had to make significant expenditures \u2014 at least in the mid-six-figures (at least $500,000) and possibly into the eight figures ($10 million or more) to obtain a BR2049 brand affiliation with Tesla and the [company\u2019s] cybercab [robotaxi] at market value, if Alcon had even been willing to do it at all,\u201d reads the original complaint filed by Alcon\u2019s legal team. \u201cThe copyright infringements here facilitated allowing Tesla to save this expenditure.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nSoftBank could soon buy Renee James' Ampere chip company for about $6.5B\ndescription3:\nAmpere, the semiconductor business founded by former Intel exec Renee James, is reportedly on the cusp of selling itself to SoftBank \u2014 the latest in an ongoing saga over the company\u2019s future ownership.\nThe deal could value Ampere at about $6.5 billion, Bloomberg reports. That\u2019s a price cut from the $8 billion valuation in 2021, when SoftBank was in talks to buy a minority stake.\nAmpere designs ARM chips for the data center, a good fit for SoftBank, which is the majority owner of chip designer ARM Holdings. Ampere declined to comment.\nAmpere was created in 2017 by James after she left a 28-year career at Intel when she was passed over for the CEO role. She had been working as a dealmaker at private equity company Carlyle and was on the board of Oracle at the time.\nJames discovered that chipmaker Macom wanted to sell a piece of its chip business, and she pitched Carlyle and Oracle with an idea to buy it. Both agreed to help her fund the acquisition.\nWhen she founded Ampere, she became one of two women leading a semiconductor company. The other is AMD CEO Lisa Su.\nJames\u2019 idea was to make data center chips from low-energy ARM designs, a novel concept for its day. Oracle became a large customer, as did other big cloud providers, including Microsoft.\nIn October, however, Oracle disclosed in its annual report that it not only owned 29% of Ampere, but it also held options and convertible notes that would allow it to commandeer a controlling stake of the company.\nThese agreements were made directly with Ampere and with other unnamed Ampere investors.\n\u201cIf either of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our results of operation,\u201d Oracle wrote.\nIn that same filing, Oracle said that James would be leaving the board at the end of her term in mid-November. James had been an Oracle board member since 2015.\nBecause Ampere is a private company, we don\u2019t know how much of it James still owns, where she\u2019s been CEO since she founded it.\nHowever, the company has been rumored to be on the market for a buyer since September and the deal with SoftBank is not final. Sources told Bloomberg that the terms could change or the deal might not happen at all.\n\ntitle4:\nApple shares slide after China reportedly considers App Store probe\ndescription4:\nApple and China's Ministry of Commerce was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nChina's market regulator has not decided whether to formally open an investigation into Apple, according to the report.\nThe State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is looking into policies that include Apple taking a cut of as much as 30% on in-app spending, as well as blocking third-party payment services and app stores, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nApple shares fell around 1% Wednesday after Bloomberg reported that Chinese regulators are considering whether to open a formal probe into the iPhone giant's App Store fees and policies.\nThe news comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China ramp up under the administration of President Donald Trump, one month into his second term.\nApple has maintained that its strict App Store policies are designed to protect users and improve the experience across its products.\nChina this week also opened a probe into Google over alleged antitrust violations, although the market regulator did not supply details over the focus of the investigation.\nThe Financial Times reported on Tuesday that the SAMR is also considering a probe into U.S. chipmaker Intel .\nApple's App Store has come under scrutiny from regulators globally. It was forced to open up its App Store in Europe, under the sweeping Digital Markets Act in the EU. This means that it now allows non-Apple companies to offer app stores in Europe, and app developers can also use third-party payment systems.\nIf the China probe goes ahead, it would cause further headache for Apple in one of its biggest markets. The Cupertino giant is already facing stiff competition from local players like Huawei that are eating away at its smartphone market share. Apple sales in Greater China declined 11% year-on-year in the December quarter.\"\n\nResponse:",
