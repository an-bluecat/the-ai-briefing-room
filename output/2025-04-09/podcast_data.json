Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday April 10), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nElon Musk's AI company, xAI, launches an API for Grok 3\ndescription0:\nBillionaire Elon Musk might\u2019ve just been countersued by OpenAI. But that isn\u2019t stopping his AI company, xAI, from making its flagship Grok 3 model available via an API.\nIt has been several months since xAI unveiled Grok 3, the company\u2019s answer to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Google\u2019s Gemini. Grok 3 can analyze images and respond to questions, and powers a number of features on Musk\u2019s social network, X, which not-so-coincidentally acquired xAI in March.\nxAI is offering two flavors of Grok 3 in its API: Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini with \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities.\nGrok 3 is priced at $3 per million tokens (~750,000 words) fed into the model and $15 per million tokens generated by the model. As for Grok 3 Mini, it\u2019s $0.30 per million input tokens and $.50 per million output tokens. Speedier versions of Grok 3 and Grok 3 Mini are available at a premium: $5/M input tokens, $25/M output tokens for Grok 3 and $.60/M input tokens, $4/M output tokens for Grok 3 Mini.\nGrok 3 isn\u2019t exactly cheap relative to the competition. It matches the pricing of Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which also offers reasoning capabilities, and it\u2019s more expensive than Google\u2019s recently released Gemini 2.5 Pro, which achieves generally higher scores than Grok 3 across popular AI benchmarks. (Not for nothing, xAI has been accused of being misleading in its Grok 3 benchmark reporting.)\nAs several users on X pointed out, Grok 3 via xAI\u2019s API also has a smaller context window than the model is allegedly capable of supporting. (\u201cContext window\u201d refers to how many tokens the model can process in one go.) The API maxes out at 131,072 tokens, or roughly 97,500 words \u2014 short of the 1 million tokens xAI claimed that Grok 3 supported in late February.\nWhen Musk announced Grok roughly two years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-\u201cwoke\u201d \u2014 in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems won\u2019t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok and Grok 2 would happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn\u2019t hear from ChatGPT.\nBut Grok models prior to Grok 3 hedged on political subjects and wouldn\u2019t cross certain boundaries. In fact, one study found that Grok leaned to the political left on topics like transgender rights, diversity programs, and inequality.\nMusk has blamed the behavior on Grok\u2019s training data \u2014 public web pages \u2014 and pledged to \u201cshift Grok closer to politically neutral.\u201d Short of high-profile mistakes like briefly censoring unflattering mentions of President Donald Trump and Musk, it\u2019s not yet clear whether xAI has achieved that goal at the model level \u2014 and what the long-term consequences might be.\n\ntitle1:\nSolid, which claimed to be the \u2018AWS of fintech,\u2019 files for bankruptcy after raising nearly $81M in funding\ndescription1:\nBanking-as-a-service startup Solid (formerly called Wise) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, according to documents filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on April 7.\nFounded in 2018, the fintech company had raised a total of nearly $81 million in funding from investors such as FTV Capital and Headline. Solid was valued at $330 million as of August 2022, according to PitchBook, when it announced a $63 million Series B round of funding led by FTV.\nPalo Alto-based Solid worked with fintech and vertical SaaS companies and offered banking, payments, cards and cryptocurrency products via easy-to-integrate APIs. The company touted itself as \u201cthe AWS of fintech\u201d and claimed in August 2022 that it had grown 10x in revenue, doubled its customers to 100 and became profitable. It is now in the process of trying to restructure or sell itself, according to the documents.\n\u201cAfter considering all options, we\u2019ve decided that a voluntary Chapter 11 restructuring is the best course,\u201d co-founder Arjun Thyagarajan told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that the court-supervised sale process will attract the right buyer, leading to a positive outcome for the company, customers, and shareholders. Solid intends to continue operating its business in the ordinary course through this process.\u201d\nSolid had not been able to raise more capital since its last funding round and \u201cfaced significant and costly litigation,\u201d according to the bankruptcy filings.\nIn 2023, Solid was the target of a lawsuit filed by Series B investor FTV Capital, which was attempting to get its $61 million investment back.\nFTV Capital\u2019s suit claimed, among other things, that Solid co-founders Thyagarajan and Raghav Lal \u201clied to FTV concerning the company\u2019s revenues, customer churn, and business generally and further deceived FTV.\u201d The firm also asked for Thyagarajan and Lal to resign.\nThe startup\u2019s co-founders pushed back, filing a countersuit against FTV and its partner Robert Anderson. In it, they described FTV as \u201can aggressive private equity firm,\u201d and claimed that \u201cthe moment its investment was no longer profitable, [the firm was] resorting to made-up claims of fraud, threats and strong-armed tactics to try to get its money back.\u201d\nAccording to the bankruptcy filing, the FTV litigation was dismissed in April of 2024 \u201cwith prejudice under a settlement reached by the parties.\u201d\nAs of the petition date, Solid said its capital structure consisted of unsecured trade debt totaling approximately $760,000 with \u201ca limited amount of current revenue\u201d and approximately $7 million in cash on hand with approximately $2 million of that held in non-liquid reserve accounts. It claims to now only have three employees.\nThe company has filed for bankruptcy under subchapter V, which imposes shorter deadlines for filing reorganization plans and allows for greater flexibility in negotiating restructuring plans with creditors.\nSolid is not the first BaaS startup to file for bankruptcy. Last April, Synapse famously filed for Chapter 11, hoping to sell its assets in a $9.7 million fire sale to another fintech, TabaPay. But TabaPay walked.\nOne thing both startups had in common? Evolve Bank & Trust was a partner bank. Notably, another fintech \u2014 Mercury \u2014 recently declared that it ended its relationship with Evolve.\nFintech Business Weekly\u2019s Jason Mikula and RK | Consultants posted about the bankruptcy on X. According to Mikula, Solid\u2019s 20 largest unsecured creditors include Amazon (AWS), regulatory consulting shop FS Vector, Visa, Plaid, Trulioo, Spade, and a number of law firms.\nTechCrunch reached out to FTV for comment but had not heard back at the time of writing.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle says it'll embrace Anthropic\u2019s standard for connecting AI models to data\ndescription2:\nJust a few weeks after OpenAI said it would adopt rival Anthropic\u2019s standard for connecting AI models to the systems where data resides, Google is following suit.\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis announced that Google will add support for Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol, or MCP, to its Gemini models and SDK. He gave no timeline.\n\u201cMCP is a good protocol and it\u2019s rapidly becoming an open standard for the AI agentic era,\u201d wrote Hassabis. \u201cLook forward to developing it further with the MCP team and others in the industry.\u201d\nMCP lets models draw data from sources like business tools and software to complete tasks, as well as from content repositories and app development environments. The protocol enables developers to build two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered applications, such as chatbots.\nDevelopers can expose data through \u201cMCP servers\u201d and build \u201cMCP clients\u201d \u2014 for instance, apps and workflows \u2014 that connect to those servers on command. In the months since Anthropic open sourced MCP, companies including Block, Apollo, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph have added MCP support for their platforms.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI countersues Elon Musk, calls for enjoinment from 'further unlawful and unfair action'\ndescription3:\nThe dramatic suit between OpenAI and its estranged co-founder, billionaire Elon Musk, shows no sign of letting up.\nIn a filing Wednesday, attorneys for OpenAI and the other defendants in the case, including CEO Sam Altman, called for Musk to be enjoined from \u201cfurther unlawful and unfair action\u201d and \u201cheld responsible for the damage he has already caused\u201d to the defendants.\n\u201cOpenAI is resilient,\u201d reads the filing for a countersuit. \u201cBut Musk\u2019s actions have taken a toll. Should his campaign persist, greater harm is threatened \u2014 to OpenAI\u2019s ability to govern in service of its mission, to the relationships that are essential to furthering that mission, and to the public interest [\u2026] Musk\u2019s continued attacks on OpenAI, culminating most recently in [a] fake takeover bid designed to disrupt OpenAI\u2019s future, must cease.\u201d\nAttorneys for Musk didn\u2019t immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nMusk\u2019s suit against OpenAI accuses the startup of abandoning its nonprofit mission to ensure its AI research benefits all humanity. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, but converted to a \u201ccapped-profit\u201d structure in 2019, and now seeks to restructure once more into a public benefit corporation.\nMusk had sought a preliminary injunction to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit. In March, a federal judge denied the request \u2014 but permitted the case to go to a jury trial in spring 2026.\nMusk, once a key supporter of OpenAI, is now perhaps its greatest adversary. The stakes are high for OpenAI, which reportedly needs to complete its for-profit conversion by 2025 or relinquish some of the capital it has raised in recent months.\nA group of organizations, including nonprofits and labor groups like the California Teamsters, petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta this week to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit entity, claiming that the company \u201cfailed to protect its charitable assets\u201d and is actively \u201csubverting its charitable mission to advance safe artificial intelligence.\u201d\nEncode, the nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California\u2019s ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, voiced similar concerns in an amicus brief filed in December.\nOpenAI has said that its conversion would preserve its nonprofit arm and infuse it with resources to be spent on \u201ccharitable initiatives\u201d in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science.\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually getting ready to build the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen \u2014 we\u2019re not converting it away,\u201d the company wrote in a series of posts on X Wednesday. \u201cElon\u2019s never been about the mission. He\u2019s always had his own agenda.\u201d\nUpdated 7:18 p.m. Pacific: In an emailed statement, Marc Toberoff, an attorney for Musk, said: \u201cHad OpenAI\u2019s board genuinely considered [Musk\u2019s bid for the company\u2019s nonprofit earlier this year] as they were obligated to do, they would have seen how serious it was. It\u2019s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI\u2019s assets allegedly \u2018interferes\u2019 with their business plans.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nWayve's self-driving tech is headed to Nissan vehicles\ndescription4:\nNissan said it will use self-driving software developed by Wayve to beef up its advanced driver assistance system starting in 2027, a landmark deal for the buzzy UK startup that has raised more than $1.3 billion from Nvidia, Microsoft, SoftBank Group, and Uber.\nNissan will integrate Wayve\u2019s software as well as sensors, including lidar from an undisclosed supplier, into its ADAS system known as ProPilot. The Japanese automaker said the system will set a \u201cnew standard for autonomous driving with advanced collision avoidance capability.\u201d\nNissan said the system being developed for mass production by 2027 will be a Level 2 system operating under driver supervision. Nissan didn\u2019t disclose which models the system would be available in. Level 2, as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, means the system can automate multiple driving tasks such as steering and braking, but still requires a driver to maintain control at all times.\nWayve, which launched in 2017, has garnered attention and investors for its automated driving system, which is self-learning versus rules-based, similar to Tesla\u2019s approach. Wayve has developed its end-to-end data-driven learning approach for \u201ceyes on\u201d assisted driving and an \u201ceyes off\u201d fully automated driving system.\nUnlike Tesla, Wayve plans to sell its \u201cEmbodied AI\u201d to automakers and other tech companies.\nWayve\u2019s self-learning approach is seen as particularly appealing to automakers because it\u2019s not reliant on specific sensors or HD maps. This means Wayve\u2019s system can work with existing sensors like cameras and radar. The automated driving software captures data from those sensors, which directly informs the driving decisions of the system.\nAnd while the startup\u2019s development fleet uses Nvidia\u2019s Orin system-on-chip, co-founder and CEO Alex Kendall has said the software can run on whatever GPU its OEM partners already have in their vehicles.\nAll of this translates to software that\u2019s cheap to run and used in advanced driver-assistance systems, robotaxis, and even robotics, Kendall said last month at Nvidia\u2019s GTC conference.\nNissan spokesperson Shiro Nagai noted in an email that Wayve\u2019s Embodied AI foundation model, a large-scale end-to-end AI trained on vast amounts of real-world driving data, allows the software to adapt across different environments and vehicle platforms.\n\u201cLeveraging Nissan\u2019s technology and Wayve\u2019s AI, we are confident it will allow future Nissan vehicles to closely replicate the judgment and actions of a careful and competent human driver in complex driving scenarios,\u201d Nagai said.\"\n\nResponse:",
