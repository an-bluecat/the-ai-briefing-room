Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The company will wind down operations and end its service to customers on October 15.\nThe Roi deal marks the latest in a string of acqui-hires from OpenAI this year, including Context.ai, Crossing Minds, and Alex.\nWhile it\u2019s not clear whether any of Roi\u2019s technology will transfer over to OpenAI or which unit Vishwajith will join, the acquisition clearly aligns with OpenAI\u2019s bet on personalization and life management as the next layer of AI products. Roi brings a specialized team that has already tried to solve personalization in finance at scale \u2014 a challenge whose lessons can be applied more broadly.\nNew York-based Roi was founded in 2022 and has raised $3.6 million in early-stage funding from investors like Balaji Srinivasan, Spark Capital, Gradient Ventures, and Spacecadet Ventures, according to PitchBook data. Its mission was to aggregate a user\u2019s financial footprint, including stocks, crypto, DeFi, real-estate, and NFTs, into one app that can track funds, provide insights, and help people make trades.\n\u201cWe started Roi 3 years ago to make investing accessible to everyone by building the most personalized financial experience,\u201d Vishwajith wrote in a post on X. \u201cAlong the way we realized personalization isn\u2019t just the future of finance. It\u2019s the future of software.\u201d\nBeyond tracking trades, Roi gave users access to a financially savvy AI companion that responded in ways that made sense for them. When signing up, users could personalize Roi by providing information like what they do for a living and how they wanted Roi to respond to them.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIn one telling example that Roi posted on X, the sample user wrote: \u201cTalk to me like I\u2019m a Gen-Z kid with brain rot. Use as little words as possible and roast me as much as you want I don\u2019t mind.\u201d In response to a query about the status of the user\u2019s portfolio, Roi replied: \u201cSuje, you got cooked lil bro. Cause of the tariff announcements, you took an L today of $32,459.12\u2026Based on your risk preference this might be an opportunity to buy the dip.\u201d\nThe exchange highlights the philosophy behind Roi and its co-founder \u2014 that software shouldn\u2019t just provide generic answers but should adapt, learn, and communicate in ways that feel personal, human, and most importantly, keep you engaged.\nAs the Roi team wrote in a blog post: \u201cThe products we use every day won\u2019t remain static, predetermined experiences. They\u2019ll become adaptive, deeply personal companions that understand us, learn from us, and evolve with us.\u201d\nThat vision dovetails with OpenAI\u2019s existing consumer efforts, including Pulse, which generates personalized news and content reports for users as they sleep; the Sora app, a TikTok competitor filled with AI-generated content, including personal cameos from users; and Instant Checkout, a feature that lets users shop and make purchases directly in ChatGPT.\nThe deal also comes as OpenAI beefs up its consumer applications team, led by former Instacart CEO Fidji Simo. It\u2019s a further signal that OpenAI isn\u2019t just trying to be an API provider, but wants to build its own end-user apps. Roi\u2019s talent and tech could slot right into these apps and help make them more adaptive.\nVishwajith, alongside his co-founder Chip Davis, used to work at Airbnb, where he developed a knack for optimizing user behavior to drive revenue. By his account, a simple change of 25 lines of code led to $10+ million in additional cash.\nBeing able to bring in meaningful revenue via consumer apps is more important than ever to OpenAI as it continues to burn through billions on data centers and infrastructure to power its models.\n\ntitle1:\nWhat to expect at OpenAI's DevDay 2025, and how to watch it\ndescription1:\nOpenAI is gearing up to host its third annual developer conference, DevDay 2025, on Monday. The company says more than 1,500 people are scheduled to convene at Fort Mason in San Francisco for OpenAI\u2019s \u201cbiggest event yet,\u201d which features announcements, keynotes from OpenAI executives, and a fireside chat between CEO Sam Altman and longtime Apple designer Jony Ive.\nFrom the sound of it, DevDay 2025 is shaping up to be a grand display of OpenAI\u2019s rising dominance in Silicon Valley against giants like Apple, Google, and Meta. OpenAI is currently building an AI device, a social media app, and an AI-powered browser to take on Chrome. In other words, OpenAI has a lot more going on than it did during its first DevDay in 2023, when it mostly just had ChatGPT and an API business for developers to access its models.\nAt the same time, OpenAI faces more competition than ever in the bid to win over developers.\nIn the last year, Anthropic\u2019s and Google\u2019s AI models have become increasingly capable for coding tasks and web design. OpenAI has been forced to release better AI models at lower prices to remain in the race. In the background, Meta has built up an impressive roster of AI talent in its new group, Meta Superintelligence Labs, which could become another threat to OpenAI in the near future.\nOpenAI unveiled at its first DevDay in 2023 a new AI model, GPT-4 Turbo, and Altman shared his vision for a marketplace of AI agents called the GPT Store. Altman was ousted as CEO days later \u2014 only to return after a dramatic weekend of negotiations. In 2024, OpenAI responded with a more subdued conference, announcing some meaningful developer upgrades, such as an API for AI voice applications, but not much else.\nNothing is confirmed to launch at DevDay 2025, stoking plenty of rumors. Perhaps OpenAI will finally unveil the AI-powered browser it\u2019s been working on, or maybe give an update on the AI device it\u2019s building with Ive and former Apple executives. It\u2019s also possible there could be some updates related to the GPT Store, which OpenAI has barely discussed since it launched last year.\nTechCrunch will be on the ground in San Francisco covering the event live, so you can check back here for all the news. Here\u2019s what you need to know about OpenAI\u2019s DevDay, and how to watch it.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nDevDay 2025 kicks off at 10 a.m. PT October 6 with an opening keynote from Altman, in which he\u2019s scheduled to unveil \u201cannouncements, live demos, and a vision of how developers are reshaping the future with AI.\u201d The keynote will last roughly one hour and will be livestreamed on OpenAI\u2019s YouTube page.\nThat\u2019s the only event that will be livestreamed for remote attendees.\nFor in-person attendees, there will be onstage presentations and talks from Cursor CEO Michael Truell, San Francisco mayor Daniel Lurie, and Andreessen Horowitz investing partner Kimberly Tan, among others. Several OpenAI employees will also give speeches about their work, including model behavior researcher Laurentia Romaniuk and Codex lead Alexander Embiricos.\nThere\u2019s also supposed to be a series of AI-powered sideshows at DevDay 2025. One of them is \u201cSora Cinema,\u201d which is described as a \u201ccozy mini-theater with popcorn\u201d featuring short films generated by OpenAI\u2019s video model, Sora. There\u2019s also supposed to be a phone booth with a \u201cliving portrait\u201d of the famed computer scientist Alan Turing \u201cthat speaks back.\u201d\nLater in the afternoon, there will be two big events to cap off DevDay. These last two events won\u2019t be livestreamed, but they will be posted on YouTube later that day.\nAt 3:15 p.m. PT, there will be a \u201cDeveloper State of the Union\u201d with OpenAI president Greg Brockman and Olivier Godement, who heads up product for the OpenAI Platform. The two OpenAI executives are slated to \u201cdemo new capabilities\u201d and share what\u2019s ahead for developers.\nFinally, at 4:15 p.m. PT, Altman and Ive will give a \u201cClosing Fireside Chat\u201d to discuss the \u201ccraft of building in the age of AI.\u201d That conversation will last about 45 minutes.\nUpdate 10/3/25: OpenAI updated the attendee list for DevDay 2025. This story has been updated to reflect the change.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI's Sora soars to No. 1 on Apple's US App Store\ndescription2:\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora app for AI videos is a viral hit, despite being invite-only for now and limited to users in the U.S. and Canada at launch. On its first day, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. On Friday, October 3, it became the No. 1 app on the U.S. App Store.\nThat puts it ahead of Google Gemini and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nThe firm estimates Sora\u2019s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30 and October 1.\nThe day-one figure also puts Sora\u2019s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI\u2019s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.\nSince Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we\u2019ll admit. It\u2019s possible the new video app could have attracted even more installs if it were open to all users.\nDespite this restriction, it\u2019s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers\u2019 hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the chagrin of some at OpenAI, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who\u2019s to say that humanity isn\u2019t benefiting from deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking, \u201cAre my piggies enjoying their slop?\u201d)\nTo compare Sora\u2019s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps\u2019 U.S. and Canadian downloads. That\u2019s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and limited itself to U.S. users at the time, while Grok limited its iOS-only release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn\u2019t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought its Claude app to iOS last year.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nFor more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app\u2019s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.\nIt found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.\nSora also hit the U.S. App Store\u2019s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78.\nThis post was originally published on October 2, 2025, 11:24 AM PT. It was updated to reflect the app\u2019s higher ranking on Friday.\n\ntitle3:\nSupabase nabs $5B valuation, four months after hitting $2B\ndescription3:\nIt\u2019s been a whirlwind year for the vibe-coding world\u2019s database of choice: Supabase. On Friday, Supabase announced that it raised a fresh $100 million Series E at a $5 billion valuation, led by Accel and Peak XV. This is just four months after closing its $200 million Series D at a $2 billion valuation, led by Accel.\nAnd that Series D was just seven months after raising an $80 million Series C led by Sequoia spinoff Peak XV and David Sacks\u2019 Craft Ventures at an undisclosed valuation. PitchBook estimated Supabase was valued at around $765 million in that deal, post-money.\nSo that\u2019s $380 million raised in a year and a more than 500% valuation step up, assuming PitchBook\u2019s estimates of the Series C valuation are in the ballpark. Supabase has now raised a total of $500 million, it says.\nOpen source database service Supabase was founded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson (pictured above), a few years before the LLM-powered vibe-coding craze spawned. It was originally a Y Combinator startup that offered developers a Postgres-based open source alternative to Google\u2019s Firebase. Firebase is a database that was also designed to power AI apps.\nSupabase combines Postgres with other enterprise-grade open source tools for features like authentication, auto-generated APIs, file storage, and a vector toolkit (necessary for many AI apps). It simplified the difficult parts of setting up a database down to a few button clicks. Consequently, it became a popular back end for vibe-coding tools \u2014 which write apps with natural language prompts \u2014 like fast-growing Lovable and Bolt. It is increasingly used as the database of choice for Figma and other uber popular AI coding tools like Replit, Cursor, and Claude Code, it says.\nInterestingly, because Supabase is open source and supported by a community of developers \u2014 claiming 4 million developers as users \u2014 it is allowing community members to also buy stock as part of this Series E funding, the company said.\n\ntitle4:\nSources: Naveen Rao\u2019s new AI hardware startup targets $5B valuation with backing from a16z\ndescription4:\nNaveen Rao, who was formerly the head of artificial intelligence at Databricks, is in talks to raise $1 billion at a $5 billion valuation for a new startup called Unconventional, Inc., that\u2019s building a new type of computer, according to four people familiar with discussions.\nAndreessen Horowitz has agreed to lead the investment, and Lightspeed and Lux Capital are also participating in the deal, two of the sources said, although none of those VC firms responded to our request for comment. Databricks is also said to be investing in Rao\u2019s new company, Bloomberg reported last month.\nRao has already raised hundreds of millions and plans to begin building the startup without waiting for the full $1 billion round to close, our sources said. He plans to raise the rest of the capital in installments, a funding approach commonly referred to as a \u201ctranched\u201d round.\nRao declined to comment, although he did publicly acknowledge the new startup on X last week, confirming its name and describing its hoped-for product as \u201crethinking the foundations of a computer to build a new substrate for intelligence that is as efficient as biology. Brain Scale Efficiency without the biological baggage!\u201d\nHello world Unconventional, Inc.\nI\u2019ve gotten a new company off the ground.

Brain Scale Efficiency without the biological baggage!\nWe CAN do it.\u2026 \u2014 Naveen Rao (@NaveenGRao) September 25, 2025\nDatabricks acquired Rao\u2019s previous startup, MosaicML in 2023, for $1.3 billion. Founded by Rao in 2020 with a focus on training and deploying large AI models, MosaicML raised $33.7 million from investors, including Lux Capital, DCVC, Playground Global, and Samsung Next, according to PitchBook. Prior to MosaicML, Rao co-founded the machine learning platform Nervana Systems, which Intel Corp. acquired in 2016 for reportedly more than $400 million.\nRao, who spent over two years as VP of AI at Databricks (now valued at $100 billion and generating $4 billion in ARR), left the company last month to focus on his new startup, according to his LinkedIn profile and earlier reporting by Bloomberg.\nOur sources say Rao\u2019s vision will essentially compete with Nvidia by designing a novel AI machine that includes both custom silicon chips and server infrastructure.\"\n\nResponse:",
