Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday February 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft says hackers are exploiting critical zero-day bugs to target Windows and Office users\ndescription0:\nMicrosoft has rolled out fixes for security vulnerabilities in Windows and Office, which the company says are being actively abused by hackers to break into people\u2019s computers.\nThe exploits are one-click attacks, meaning that a hacker can plant malware or gain access to a victim\u2019s computer with minimal user interaction. At least two flaws can be exploited by tricking someone into clicking a malicious link on their Windows computer. Another can result in a compromise on opening a malicious Office file.\nThe vulnerabilities are known as zero-days, because the hackers were exploiting the bugs before Microsoft had time to fix them.\nDetails of how to exploit the bugs have been published, Microsoft said, potentially increasing the chance of hacks. Microsoft did not say where they had been published, and a Microsoft spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch. In its bug reports, Microsoft acknowledged the input of security researchers in Google\u2019s Threat Intelligence Group in their discovery of the vulnerabilities.\nMicrosoft said one of the bugs, officially tracked as CVE-2026-21510, was found in the Windows shell, which powers the operating system\u2019s user interface. The bug affects all supported versions of Windows, the company said. When a victim clicks on a malicious link from their computer, the bug allows hackers to bypass Microsoft\u2019s SmartScreen feature that would typically screen malicious links and files for malware.\nAccording to security expert Dustin Childs, this bug can be abused to remotely plant malware on the victim\u2019s computer.\n\u201cThere is user interaction here, as the client needs to click a link or a shortcut file,\u201d Childs wrote in his blog post. \u201cStill, a one-click bug to gain code execution is a rarity.\u201d\nA Google spokesperson confirmed that the Windows shell bug was under \u201cwidespread, active exploitation,\u201d and said successful hacks allowed the silent execution of malware with high privileges, \u201cposing a high risk of subsequent system compromise, deployment of ransomware, or intelligence collection.\u201d\nAnother Windows bug, tracked as CVE-2026-21513, was found in Microsoft\u2019s proprietary browser engine, MSHTML, which powers its legacy and long-discontinued Internet Explorer browser. It\u2019s still found in newer versions of Windows to ensure backward compatibility with older apps.\nMicrosoft said this bug allows hackers to bypass security features in Windows to plant malware.\nAccording to independent security reporter Brian Krebs, Microsoft also patched three other zero-day bugs in its software that were being actively exploited by hackers.\n\ntitle1:\nUber Eats launches AI assistant to help with grocery cart creation\ndescription1:\nUber Eats announced a new AI feature, \u201cCart Assistant,\u201d on Wednesday designed to fill customers\u2019 grocery carts faster and easier. The beta version is now available in the app.\u200b\nTo use the new chatbot, users search for a grocery store in the Uber Eats app and tap the purple Cart Assistant icon on the store\u2019s page to begin shopping.\nCustomers can enter a list or upload an image of one, and Cart Assistant will automatically add the necessary items to their basket. This includes photos of handwritten lists or screenshots of recipes and their ingredients. Users can then customize the basket by swapping items for preferred brands or adding more products from the store.\u200b\nImage Credits:Uber Eats\nUber Eats notes that Cart Assistant uses previous orders to prioritize familiar items \u2014 like your usual milk or favorite oatmeal \u2014 to make the experience more personalized.\u200b\n\u201cUsers were telling us they wanted a quicker way to shop, and we know how precious your time is,\u201d Uber CTO Praveen Neppalli Naga said in a statement. \u201cCart Assistant helps you get from idea to checkout in seconds.\u201d\nCart Assistant could help Uber Eats better compete with other food delivery and grocery apps that are already integrating or developing AI chatbots.\u200b For example, Instacart launched an AI search tool powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2023 to help customers save time and receive personalized shopping recommendations. DoorDash was also reportedly testing an AI chatbot called DashAI that same year.\u200b\nLast year, both Uber Eats and rival DoorDash integrated with ChatGPT to streamline food ordering. With Uber Eats, U.S. users can browse local restaurants and menus in ChatGPT, then complete their purchase in the Uber Eats app. DoorDash\u2019s integration allows users to request meal plans and automatically add all necessary ingredients to their DoorDash cart.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nNotably, Bloomberg reported in 2023 that Uber Eats was developing an AI-powered chatbot that would supposedly ask users about their budget and food preferences, and help them place an order.\u200b\nOverall, Uber Eats is rapidly investing in AI, including tools for merchants like AI-generated menu descriptions, enhanced food photos, and customer review summaries.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon Pharmacy to expand same-day delivery to nearly 4,500 US cities\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nAmazon Pharmacy, the retail giant\u2019s online pharmacy, plans to bring same-day prescription delivery to almost 4,500 U.S. cities and towns by the end of this year, adding nearly 2,000 new communities to its network. The expansion will cover customers in newly served states such as Idaho and Massachusetts, the company announced on Wednesday.\nAmazon launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020, two years after its $753 million acquisition of prescription medicine delivery service PillPack. In 2023, Amazon launched RxPass, a service that offers Prime members in the U.S. as many generic versions of medications as they need for a $5 monthly fee.\n\u201cPatients shouldn\u2019t have to choose between speed, cost, and convenience when it comes to their medication, regardless of where they live,\u201d said John Love, vice president of Amazon Pharmacy, in a press release. \u201cBy combining our pharmacy expertise with our logistics network, we\u2019re removing critical barriers and helping patients start treatment faster\u2014setting a new standard for accessible, digital-forward pharmacy care.\u201d\nIn October, the e-commerce giant debuted prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics. The in-office kiosks, which are operated by Amazon Pharmacy, let patients pick up their prescriptions immediately after their appointment.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI disbands mission alignment team\ndescription3:\nOpenAI has disbanded a team that was designed to communicate the company\u2019s mission to the public and to its own employees. At the same time, the team\u2019s former leader has been given a new role as the company\u2019s \u201cchief futurist.\u201d\nOpenAI confirmed to TechCrunch that the team\u2019s members have now been assigned to other roles. The news was first reported by Platformer.\nThe disbanded team in question appears to have been formed in September of 2024. Platformer reports that the team was dedicated to promoting \u201cthe company\u2019s stated mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\u201d\nAn official OpenAI spokesperson described the team thusly: \u201cThe Mission Alignment project was a support function to help employees and the public understand our mission and the impact of AI. That work continues throughout the organization.\u201d\nIn a blog post published Wednesday, Josh Achiam, the former head of OpenAI\u2019s mission alignment team, explained his new role as the company\u2019s chief futurist. \u201cMy goal is to support OpenAI\u2019s mission \u2014 to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity \u2014 by studying how the world will change in response to AI, AGI, and beyond,\u201d Achiam wrote.\nAchiam noted that, in his new role, he would be collaborating with Jason Pruet, an OpenAI physicist.\nA spokesperson for OpenAI said the rest of the mission alignment team \u2014 a group of six or seven people \u2014 had subsequently been reassigned to different parts of the company. The spokesperson couldn\u2019t say where exactly the team members had been assigned, but said that they were engaged in similar work in those roles. It was also unclear whether Achiam would have a new team as part of his \u201cfuturist\u201d role.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe spokesperson attributed the disbanding of the team to the kinds of routine reorganizations that occur within a fast-moving company.\nOpenAI previously had what it called a \u201csuperalignment team\u201d \u2014 which was formed in 2023 and focused on studying long-term existential threats posed by AI \u2014 but that team was disbanded in 2024.\nAchiam\u2019s personal website still lists him as head of mission alignment at OpenAI, and describes him as being interested in ensuring that the \u201clong-term future of humanity is good.\u201d His LinkedIn profile shows he had served as head of mission alignment since September 2024.\nCorrection: This story originally confused mission alignment with another, similarly named team called alignment. It has been corrected and we apologize for the error.\n\ntitle4:\nxAI lays out interplanetary ambitions in public all-hands\ndescription4:\nOn Wednesday, xAI took the rare step of publishing a full 45-minute all-hands meeting video on X, making it publicly accessible. Details of the Tuesday night meeting were previously reported by The New York Times, which may have influenced xAI\u2019s decision to post the video online.\nThe full video reveals significant new details about Musk\u2019s plans for the AI lab, including its product roadmap and its ongoing ties to the X platform.\nSince xAI was formed just 30 months ago, the small and talented team has made remarkable progress.\nThe future has never looked more exciting! pic.twitter.com/QZ73H2mpBj \u2014 xAI (@xai) February 11, 2026\nThe most immediate revelation concerned a string of departing employees, which Musk described as layoffs resulting from a changing organizational structure at the company. While reorganizations are common, the breadth of the departures has caused significant confusion, particularly as it has meant the loss of a significant portion of the founding team.\n\u201cAs a company grows, especially as quickly as xAI, the structure must evolve,\u201d Musk said on X. \u201cThis unfortunately required parting ways with some people. We wish them well in future endeavors.\u201d\nThe new organizational system splits xAI into four primary teams: one focused on the Grok chatbot (including voice), another for the app\u2019s coding system, another for the Imagine video generator, and finally a team focused on the Macrohard project, which spans from simple computer use simulation to modeling entire corporations.\n\u201c[Macrohard] is able to do anything on a computer that a computer is able to do,\u201d Toby Pohlen, who will lead the project under the new organizational structure, told his colleagues. \u201cThere should be rocket engines fully designed by AI.\u201d\nImage Credits:xAI (screenshot)\nThe all-hands also featured claims about new usage and revenue figures for xAI and X. Nikita Bier, X\u2019s head of product, said X had \u201cjust crossed\u201d $1 billion in annual recurring revenue from subscriptions, which he attributed to a marketing push during the holidays.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nAdditionally, executives said the xAI\u2019s Imagine tool is generating 50 million videos a day, and more than 6 billion images over the past 30 days, according to their internal metrics.\nBut it\u2019s difficult to separate those figures from the flood of deepfake pornography that overtook X during that same period. The X platform saw engagement skyrocket as AI-generated explicit images became more prevalent, and with an estimated 1.8 million sexualized images generated over just nine days, the image-generation figures likely include substantial amounts of this controversial content.\nThe most eye-catching part of the presentation came at the end, when Musk reemphasized the importance of space-based data centers despite the technical challenges involved. Musk went still further, envisioning a moon-based factory for AI satellites, including a lunar mass driver \u2014 essentially an electromagnetic catapult \u2014 to launch them. With such infrastructure, Musk said, one could launch an AI cluster capable of capturing significant portions of the sun\u2019s total energy output or even expanding to other galaxies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about,\u201d Musk said, \u201cbut it\u2019s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
