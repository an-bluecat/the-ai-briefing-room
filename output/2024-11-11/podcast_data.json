Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday November 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon confirms employee data stolen after hacker claims MOVEit breach\ndescription0:\nAmazon has confirmed that employee data was compromised after a \u201csecurity event\u201d at a third-party vendor.\nIn a statement given to TechCrunch on Monday, Amazon spokesperson Adam Montgomery confirmed that employee information had been involved in a data breach.\n\u201cAmazon and AWS systems remain secure, and we have not experienced a security event. We were notified about a security event at one of our property management vendors that impacted several of its customers including Amazon. The only Amazon information involved was employee work contact information, for example work email addresses, desk phone numbers, and building locations,\u201d Montgomery said.\nAmazon declined to say how many employees were impacted by the breach. It noted that the unnamed third-party vendor doesn\u2019t have access to sensitive data such as Social Security numbers or financial information and said the vendor had fixed the security vulnerability responsible for the data breach.\nThe confirmation comes after a threat actor claimed to have published data stolen from Amazon on notorious hacking site BreachForums. The individual claims to have more than 2.8 million lines of data, which they say was stolen during last year\u2019s mass-exploitation of MOVEit Transfer.\nThe threat actor, operating under the alias \u201cNam3L3ss\u201d claims to have published data allegedly stolen from 25 major organizations, cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock reports.\n\u201cWhat you have seen so far is less than .001% of the data I have,\u201d the threat actor claims. \u201cI have 1,000 releases coming never seen before.\u201d\nTechCrunch has contacted the other organizations listed by the threat actor but has not yet received any further responses.\nThe MOVEit breach, which saw attackers exploit a zero-day vulnerability in Progress Software\u2019s file-transfer software, was the biggest hack of 2023.\nThese hacks, which were claimed by the notorious Clop ransomware and extortion gang, impacted more than 1,000 organisations, including the Oregon Department of Transportation (3.5 million records stolen), the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (four million) and U.S. government services contracting giant Maximus (11 million).\n\ntitle1:\nFTX sues crypto exchange Binance and its former CEO Zhao for $1.8 billion\ndescription1:\nChangpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2022.\nThe estate of collapsed crypto exchange FTX has filed a suit against Binance and its former CEO Changpeng Zhao in an effort to wrest back at least $1.76 billion, citing a \"fraudulent\" share deal.\nIn a Sunday filing with a Delaware court, FTX cites a 2021 transaction in which Binance, Zhao and others exited their investment in FTX, selling a 20% stake in the platform and a 18.4% stake in its U.S.-based entity West Realm Shires back to the company.\nThe FTX estate alleges that the share repurchase was funded by FTX's Alameda Research division through a combination of the company's and Binance's exchange tokens, as well as Binance's dollar-pegged stablecoin.\n\"Alameda was insolvent at the time of the share repurchase and could not afford to fund the transaction,\" the suit claims, labeling the deal agreed with FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried \u2014 who's now serving a 25-year sentence over fraud linked to the downfall of his exchange \u2014 a \"constructive fraudulent transfer.\"\nBinance denies the allegations, saying in an emailed statement, \"The claims are meritless, and we will vigorously defend ourselves.\"\nThe litigation marks the latest escalation of tensions between two of the biggest names in the crypto space, after the meteoric collapse of FTX rocked the industry.\nOnce a $32 billion empire, FTX disintegrated into bankruptcy when it was unable to keep pace with a torrent of customer withdrawals, triggering a plunge in the crypto markets.\nThe market fallout peaked in November last year, when Bankman-Fried was found guilty of seven criminal fraud counts relating to the bankruptcy of the exchange and theft of customer funds. That same month, Binance's Zhao pleaded guilty to charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act for failing to put in motion an effective anti-money-laundering program and for breaching U.S. economic sanctions.\nIn addition to recovering funds, the latest lawsuit also accuses Zhao of \"a series of false, misleading and fraudulent tweets\" that it alleges \"triggered a predictable avalanche of withdrawals at FTX,\" eventually leading to the exchange's collapse.\nThe suit cited a Nov. 6 post on X in which Zhao said, with reference to FTX token FTT: \"Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce.\"\nIn another post cited, he said: \"As part of Binance's exit from FTX equity last year, Binance received roughly $2.1 billion USD equivalent in cash (BUSD and FTT). Due to recent revelations that have came to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books.\"\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle Learn About takes AI chatbot answers a step further\ndescription2:\nGoogle has launched an experimental new AI tool called Learn About, which is different from the chatbots we\u2019re used to, like Gemini and ChatGPT. It\u2019s built on the LearnLM AI model that Google introduced this spring, saying it\u2019s \u201cgrounded in educational research and tailored to how people learn.\u201d The answers it provides have more visual and interactive elements with educational formatting.\nWe tested Learn About and Google Gemini with a simple prompt: \u201cHow big is the universe?\u201d Both answered that \u201cthe observable universe\u201d is \u201cabout 93 billion light-years in diameter.\u201d\nHowever, while Gemini opted to show a Wikipedia-provided diagram of the universe and a two-paragraph summary with links to sources, Learn About emphasized an image from the educational site Physics Forums and added related content that was similarly focused more on learning than simply offering facts and definitions.\nLearn About\u2019s answer to \u201cHow big is the universe?\u201d Screenshot: Jake Kastrenakes / The Verge\nGemini\u2019s answer to \u201cHow big is the universe?\u201d Screenshot: Jake Kastrenakes / The Verge\nLearn About\u2019s response also created textbook-style boxes that give you additional context like \u201cwhy it matters\u201d and ones that help you \u201cBuild your vocab\u201d with word definitions. In the sidebar, additional topics appear to continue exploring using the tool.\nWe also asked Learn About \u201cWhat\u2019s the best kind of glue to put on a pizza?\u201d (Google\u2019s AI search overviews have struggled with this one in the past), and it managed to get that one right, even if the \u201ccommon misconception\u201d sticker makes us wonder how many times this question has been asked.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta taps US, UK universities to test VR in education, creates digital twin 'metaversities' in Europe\ndescription3:\nAs part of an ongoing effort to embed virtual reality (VR) in education, Meta has launched a new partnership with a slew of universities in the U.S. and U.K., designed to provide feedback on a new product that Meta hopes will finally make VR just a little more mainstream.\nThe new Meta for Education beta program will see Facebook\u2019s parent company partner with 13 educational institutions, which will get access to an early version of a product that Meta has been teasing for a while already. In a blog post on Monday, Meta said it wants to \u201cmake it easier for educators to discover interactive and engaging content,\u201d spanning subjects such as science, medicine, history, and language arts.\nAhead of the program\u2019s formal launch, universities will be tasked with testing VR and mixed reality (XR) prototypes in class, ahead of a more formal launch in the future. The universities include: Arizona State University, Houston Community College, Imperial College London, Miami Dade College, Morehouse College, New Mexico State University, San Diego State University, Savannah College of Art & Design, The University of Glasgow, University of Iowa, University of Leeds, University of Miami, and University of Michigan.\nMeta also said it\u2019s bringing its \u201cdigital twin\u201d metaversity program to Europe, starting with the University of Leeds in the U.K.; University of the Basque Country in Spain; and the University of Hannover in Germany. This follows more than two years after Meta partnered with a company called VictoryXR to power virtual university programs in the U.S. \u2014 in environments that directly replicate their real-world campus counterparts.\nMeta says \u201cimmersive classes\u201d have begun already at the University of Leeds, with an initial focus on performance and theater. The University of Basque Country, meanwhile, will follow suit in February 2025 with classes on physiotherapy and anatomy, while the University of Hannover will offer immersive classes starting in the next academic year.\nThe University of Leeds\u2019 \u201cMetaversity\u201d. Image Credits:Meta\nVirtual education\nToday\u2019s announcement comes some seven months after Meta teased a new education-focused product built around its Quest headsets, including a hub for education apps and tools, and controls to enable administrators to manage multiple headsets centrally. At the time, Meta said it planned to make the product available to \u201cinstitutions serving learners aged 13+,\u201d however today\u2019s news suggests that \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 it\u2019s focusing on older learners.\nHowever, it also shows that Meta is far from giving up on its costly VR endeavors \u2014 Meta\u2019s Reality Labs outfit, focused on all-things VR and AR, continues to haemorrhage money. Its most recent earnings showed that while revenue was up 29% year-on-year to $270 million, its expenses were also up, leading to an overall Q3 loss of $4.4 billion, a figure the company expects to keep growing due to \u201congoing product development\u201d and \u201cinvestments to further scale our ecosystem.\u201d\nBut with Apple throwing its hat into the immersive headset ring with the Vision Pro, some believe this could be the catalyst to catapult mixed reality \u2014 including VR and AR \u2014 into the mainstream arena.\n\ntitle4:\nTesla shares pop 9% as postelection rally continues\ndescription4:\nTesla shares closed up nearly 9% on Monday, continuing to ride a postelection rally as President-elect Donald Trump, closely allied with CEO Elon Musk, begins to set up his presidential cabinet.\nAnalysts at Wedbush reiterated their outperform rating on the stock, joining earlier sunny outlooks reacting to Tuesday's results. Tesla recently reclaimed its $1 trillion market cap after surging nearly 30% last week.\n\"We are raising our price target on Tesla to $400 from $300 as we believe the Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years,\" the Wedbush analysts wrote.\nMusk's wealth rocketed past $300 billion in the days since Trump's decisive electoral win, further cementing his place as the richest man in the world and joining the wave of gains across the technology and crypto sector since postelection trading began.\nIt is unclear whether Musk, who spent at least $130 million on Trump's campaign, will receive an official title in the second Trump White House or if he will influence policy decisions from his inner circle.\nEither way, Musk stands to earn potentially billions from new government contracts with his companies, on top of the $19 billion SpaceX has already been awarded. Some or all of the 19 known ongoing federal lawsuits and investigations into his companies may begin to wind down entirely.\n\"It is difficult to judge how Elon Musk's increasingly close public relationship with President Trump could benefit Tesla, but this needs to be monitored closely,\" analysts from Bank of America wrote in a note last week, raising their Tesla price target from $265 to $350.\nTrump has said previously he may cut the federal $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, and those credits have historically helped drive sales of Tesla vehicles.\nAt one of his final campaign rallies, Trump suggested Musk could be put in charge of \"government efficiency,\" and he was present on Trump's phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy two days ago.\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom, Annie Palmer and Lora Kolodny contributed reporting.\"\n\nResponse:",
