Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

HTC will retain rights to use and develop the technology.\nThe transaction marks the second major deal between the companies after Google\u2019s $1.1 billion purchase of HTC\u2019s smartphone unit in 2017.\nGoogle said the acquisition will accelerate Android XR platform development across headsets and glasses. The move comes as tech giants race to establish dominance in XR technology, with Apple and Meta maintaining their lead in the virtual reality market.\nGoogle and HTC will explore additional collaboration opportunities, they said.\n\ntitle1:\nEA lowers Q3 guidance as soccer and other games 'underperformed'\ndescription1:\nVisitors play the 'EA Sports FC 25' game in front of a placard with England's midfielder Jude Bellingham at the Electronic Arts booth during the media day at the Gamescom video games trade fair in Cologne, western Germany on Aug. 21, 2024.\nElectronic Arts slashed its full-year bookings guidance on Wednesday, blaming the shortfall on underperforming games, notably its soccer franchise, EA Sports FC. The shares dropped 7% in extended trading.\nFor the fiscal third quarter, which ended Dec. 31, EA said it expects to report about $2.215 billion in net bookings, versus previous guidance of $2.4 billion to $2.55 billion.\nRevenue in the December quarter will be about $1.88 billion, with $1.11 in diluted earnings per share, the company said in a statement.\nEA said it expects net bookings for the full fiscal year, ending March 31, of between $7 billion and $7.15 billion, below previous guidance of $7.5 billion to $7.8 billion. EA says net bookings include physical game sales as well as revenue from online games.\nThe warning reveals weakness in the most prominent soccer video game franchise since 1993. It used to fall under the FIFA branding, but in 2022 EA's deal with FIFA ended and the last two EA soccer games have been sold as EA Sports FC.\nThe company also said that \"Dragon Age,\" a role-playing game for game consoles such as Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox, had 1.5 million players during the quarter, which underperformed the company's expectations by nearly 50%.\n\"During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio,\" EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in the statement. \"However, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations.\"\nEA said that while its soccer franchise, which it calls Global Football, had seen two years of double-digit growth in net booking, it started to see a slowdown during the December quarter. The company said that it expects Global Football sales to be down on a year-over-year basis, and said that bookings from online sales, or live services, would also decline in fiscal 2025. The company's soccer franchise, accounted for the majority of the live services shortfall.\nEA said that recently updated FC 25 with new content, improved gameplay, and an annual \"Team of the Year\" update, which it says was well-received by players.\nThe warning comes weeks ahead of EA's planned third-quarter earnings on Feb. 4.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta backs Databricks as the data analytics startup inches toward IPO\ndescription2:\nData analytics software startup Databricks said Wednesday that Meta has signed on as an investor.\nAs the company that trains the popular Llama open-source large language models, or LLMs, that Databricks builds on, Meta plays an important role in the artificial intelligence. Databricks works closely with Meta's Llama team, the startup's co-founder and CEO, Ali Ghodsi, said in an interview this week.\nThe relationship goes all the way up to Meta co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\"We've discussed open-source software in the past, and he cares a lot about open-source models and Llama,\" Ghodsi said.\nMeta doesn't invest in nearly as many startups as technology peers Alphabet and Microsoft. But Databricks has been a fast-growing company on a path to a major initial public offering. Meta invested in a $10 billion round for Databricks, one of the largest investments in the history of venture capital. Databricks has now raised $14 billion in venture funding.\nThe new money will go toward global expansion and liquidity for current and former employees.\nOn Wednesday Databricks also announced a $5.25 billion credit facility led by JPMorgan Chase. Credit can be a much better option than spending with stock and diluting existing shareholders, even with a high interest rate, Ghodsi said.\nThe money in the bank did enable Databricks last year to train its own open-source LLM called DBRX, at a cost of about $10 million. DBRX performed better than Meta's Llama and other alternatives in some tests at the time, but other models quickly surpassed it.\nThat's one reason it was reasonable for Databricks to ally itself with the most prominent open model builder. Meta has plenty of money to spend on capital expenditures to train models, and Databricks can use its money in other ways, Ghodsi said.\nHe wouldn't specify whether Meta is a client, nor would he say how much the operator of Facebook and Instagram invested.\nSan Francisco-based Databricks now employs 8,000 people. Ghodsi said it would not be \"a huge surprise to me if we were public\" a year from now.\nQatar's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, participated in the $10 billion round alongside Meta. Ghodsi said Databricks is open to allowing its software to run on data centers from major operators in the Middle East. Today, it's only available through the Amazon , Google and Microsoft clouds.\nDo you run or represent an early-stage, innovative startup?

Business Insider reported earlier on the cuts and the memo.\nA Stripe spokesperson also confirmed to CNBC that a cartoon image of a duck with text that read, \"US-Non-California Duck,\" was accidentally attached as a PDF to emails sent to some of the employees who were laid off. Some of the emails mistakenly provided affected employees with an incorrect termination date, the spokesperson said.\nMcIntosh sent a follow-up email to staffers apologizing for the \"notification error\" and \"any confusion it caused.\"\n\"Corrected and full notifications have since been sent to all impacted Stripes,\" he wrote.\nIn 2022, Stripe cut roughly 1,100 jobs, or 14% of its workers, downsizing alongside most of the tech industry, as soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced companies to focus on profits over growth. The Information reported that Stripe had a few dozen layoffs in its recruiting department in 2023.\nStripe's valuation sank from a peak of $95 billion in 2021 to $50 billion in 2023, before reportedly rebounding to $70 billion last year as part of a secondary share sale. The company ranked third on last year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.\nIn October, Stripe agreed to pay $1.1 billion for crypto startup Bridge Network, whose technology is focused on making it easy for businesses to transact using digital currencies.\nBrothers Patrick and John Collison, who founded Stripe in 2010, have intentionally steered clear of the public markets and have given no indication that an offering is on the near-term horizon. Total payment volume at the company surpassed $1 trillion in 2023.\nCorrection: A prior version of this story had an incorrect number for the company's expected headcount increase.\nWATCH: Early Bridge investor weighs in on $1.1 billion Stripe deal\n\ntitle4:\nspecs, price, release date, AI features\ndescription4:\nSamsung S25 Ultra on display at one of Samsung's stores in London, U.K. Samsung has boosted the capabilities of the S25 on the Ultra model. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\nSamsung Electronics on Wednesday launched its latest flagship smartphones \u2014 the Galaxy S25 series \u2014 touting a custom chip and boosted AI features. The S25 release comes after a year in which Samsung's smartphone shipments came under pressure from Chinese players and Apple . Samsung's S25 series comes in three variants \u2014 the S25, S25+ and the S25 Ultra \u2014 as has been the case with previous flagship launches. The starting prices are as follows: Galaxy S25: $799\n$799 Galaxy S25+: $999\n$999 Galaxy S25 Ultra: $1,299 Samsung will start taking preorders for the S25 series on Wednesday and the devices will go on sale on Feb. 7.\nSamsung Galaxy AI front and center\nLast year, Samsung launched Galaxy AI \u2014 its suite of artificial intelligence features \u2014 on the S24. With the S25, Samsung unveiled additional AI applications with the aim of making the phone more like a digital personal assistant.\nSamsung's latest devices can carry out tasks across multiple apps when prompted. For example, a user can ask the phone to find their favorite football team's schedule and add it to their calendar. Or a user could prompt the AI application to find nearby pet-friendly restaurants to send to a specific contact. All of these actions will be carried out by the device across multiple apps. Samsung said the feature supports third-party apps like Spotify and Meta -owned WhatsApp, as well as its own and Google 's apps. The AI application can also change settings on the phone when prompted by a user. Samsung's latest features underscore the way in which the South Korean tech giant and some of its rivals are racing to make AI on devices more like personal assistants that cater to a person's usage habits and preferences.\nThe Samsung S25 series consists of three devices - the S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra. Arjun Kharpal | CNBC\nLast year, Apple began rolling out Apple Intelligence, its suite of AI features to iPhones. Device makers view AI as way to differentiate their hardware from the sea of competitors. Samsung, for example, is hoping the technology will help revive sales for its high-end product. \"At a time when improvements to hardware capabilities and product design are largely incremental, Samsung is doubling down on its AI story. There are some clever enhancements included in the Galaxy S25 line-up, but it's unlikely they'll be enough to have consumers rushing out to upgrade their phones prematurely,\" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC. \"However, this is far from being a unique issue for Samsung. Apple is facing the same challenges with the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. AI is a boon for someone who needs an upgrade, but not enough to move the needle for consumers who have a relatively up-to-date phone already.\" Shipments of Samsung smartphones fell 2.7% year on year in the fourth quarter of last year as its market share contracted, according to International Data Corp. figures. Samsung was the No. 2 player by shipment volume after Apple. Meanwhile, Chinese players Xiaomi, Transsion and Vivo increased market share, with aggressively priced devices boasting solid specs. CCS Insight's Wood concluded that the S25 series is \"well suited to the growing number of consumers who have a mobile phone that's three or four years old\" but \"it's unlikely to get people upgrading any sooner.\"\nCustom chip, new design\"\n\nResponse:",
