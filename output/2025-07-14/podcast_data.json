Nvidia is also introducing a new \u201cRTX Pro\u201d chip designed specifically for the Chinese market, calling it \u201cfully compliant\u201d with regulations and ideal for digital manufacturing applications like smart factories and logistics.\nThe H20 chip sits at the center of a broader U.S.-China tech standoff. While not Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI processor, the H20 is the most powerful chip the company can legally sell to China under existing export controls. It\u2019s specifically designed for \u201cinference\u201d tasks \u2014 running existing AI models for day-to-day applications \u2014 rather than training new AI systems from scratch.\nChinese tech giants including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent had been aggressively stockpiling these chips in the first three months of this year in anticipation of stricter export controls. The chip\u2019s appeal lies partly in its superior memory bandwidth compared to Chinese alternatives, along with Nvidia\u2019s widely-adopted software ecosystem that makes the hardware easier to deploy.\nThe regulatory back-and-forth began in April when the Trump administration restricted H20 sales, potentially costing Nvidia $15 billion to $16 billion in revenue, judging by how much Chinese firms reportedly splashed out for them in the first quarter alone. The move targeted chips exceeding specific performance thresholds, including total memory bandwidth of 1,400 gigabytes per second or input/output bandwidth of 1,100 GB per second.\nBut the restrictions were fairly short-lived. Soon after CEO Jensen Huang attended a $1 million-per-head dinner at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in early April, the administration paused the ban. According to NPR, Huang promised new U.S. data center investments and American jobs in exchange for continued chip access. (Within a week of NPR\u2019s report being published, Nvidia announced plans to build AI servers in the U.S. worth as much as $500 billion over the next four years, with help from partners such as TSMC.)\nThe flip-flopping has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers who argue it undermines the country\u2019s efforts to limit China\u2019s AI capabilities. Chinese startup DeepSeek took the AI world by storm earlier this year by building a model rivaling OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT using Nvidia\u2019s H800 chips, which are slightly more powerful predecessors to the H20. (The U.S. banned the sale of those H800 chips back in October 2023, but Chinese suppliers have managed to figure out workarounds.)\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez said Huang has been meeting with officials in Washington and Beijing this month, \u201cemphasizing the benefits that AI will bring to business and society worldwide.\u201d\nIn the meantime, this latest whole episodes underscores the ongoing balancing act that U.S. policymakers are facing, with concerns about national security concerns running up against powerful commercial interests. Given what we\u2019ve already seen in 2025, we can probably expect more reversals of its kind, too.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta built its AI reputation on openness \u2014 that may be changing\ndescription1:\nTop members of Meta\u2019s new Superintelligence Lab discussed pivoting away from the company\u2019s powerful open source AI model, Behemoth, and instead developing a closed model, reports The New York Times.\nSources told The Times that Meta had completed training on Behemoth, but delayed its release due to underwhelming internal performance. When the new Superintelligence Lab launched, testing on the model reportedly halted.\nThe discussions are just that \u2014 discussions. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg would still need to sign off on any changes, and a company spokesperson told TechCrunch that Meta\u2019s position on open source AI is \u201cunchanged.\u201d\n\u201cWe plan to continue releasing leading open source models,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t released everything we\u2019ve developed historically and we expect to continue training a mix of open and closed models going forward.\u201d\nThe spokesperson did not comment on Meta\u2019s potential shift away from Behemoth. If that happens so that Meta can prioritize closed-source models, it would mark a major philosophical change for the company.\nWhile Meta deploys more advanced closed-source models internally, like those powering its Meta AI assistant, Zuckerberg had made open source a central part of the company\u2019s external AI strategy \u2014 a way to keep AI development moving faster. He loudly positioned the Llama family\u2019s openness as a differentiator from competitors like OpenAI, which Zuckerberg publicly criticized for becoming more closed after partnering with Microsoft. But Meta is under pressure to monetize beyond ads as it pours billions into AI.\nThat includes paying massive signing bonuses and nine-figure salaries to poach top researchers, building out new data centers, and covering the enormous costs of developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), or \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nDespite having one of the top AI research labs in the world, Meta still lags behind rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and xAI when it comes to commercializing its AI work.\nIf Meta prioritizes closed models, it could suggest that openness was a strategic play, not an ideological one. Past comments from Zuckerberg hint at an ambivalence toward committing to open sourcing Meta\u2019s models. On a podcast last summer, he said:\nWe\u2019re obviously very pro open source, but I haven\u2019t committed to releasing every single thing that we do. I\u2019m basically very inclined to think that open sourcing is going to be good for the community and also good for us because we\u2019ll benefit from the innovations. If at some point, however, there\u2019s some qualitative change in what the thing is capable of, and we feel like it\u2019s not responsible to open source it, then we won\u2019t. It\u2019s all very difficult to predict.\nClosed models would give Meta more control and more ways to monetize \u2014 especially if it believes the talent it has acquired can deliver competitive, best-in-class performance.\nSuch a shift could also reshape the AI landscape. Open source momentum, largely driven by Meta and models like Llama, could slow, even as OpenAI gears up to release its still-delayed open model. Power could swing back toward the major players with closed ecosystems, while open source development might remain a product of grassroots efforts. The ripple effects would continue across the startup ecosystem, especially for smaller companies focused on fine-turning, safety, and model alignment that rely on access to open foundation models.\nOn the world stage, Meta\u2019s retreat from open source could potentially cede ground to China, which has embraced open source AI \u2014 like DeepSeek and Moonshot AI \u2014 as a way to build domestic capability and global influence.\n\ntitle2:\nFollowing YouTube, Meta announces crackdown on 'unoriginal' Facebook content\ndescription2:\nMeta announced on Monday that it will take additional measures to crack down on accounts sharing \u201cunoriginal\u201d content to Facebook, meaning those that repeatedly reuse someone else\u2019s text, photos, or videos. This year, Meta has already taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators, it said.\nPlus, it has taken action against 500,000 accounts that were engaged in \u201cspammy behavior or fake engagement.\u201d Those actions have included things like demoting the accounts\u2019 comments and reducing the distribution of their content to prevent the accounts from monetizing.\nThe update from Meta follows only days after YouTube said it was also clarifying its policy around unoriginal content, including mass-produced and repetitive videos \u2014 things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology.\nLike YouTube, Meta says it won\u2019t penalize users who are engaging with other people\u2019s content, doing things like making reaction videos, joining a trend, or adding their own takes. Instead, Meta\u2019s focus is on the reposting of others\u2019 content, either on spam accounts or those that pretend to belong to the original creator.\nAccounts that abuse the system by repeatedly reusing someone else\u2019s content will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a period of time and see reduced distribution of their posts, the company said. When Facebook detects duplicate videos, it will also reduce the distribution of the copies to ensure the original creator gets the views and credit.\nIn addition, the company said it\u2019s testing a system that adds links on duplicate videos that point viewers to the original content.\nImage Credits:Meta\nThe update arrives as Meta weathers criticism from users across its platforms, including Instagram, about erroneous, over-enforcement of its policies through automated means. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures asks Meta to fix the issue with wrongfully disabled accounts and its lack of human support, which has users feeling abandoned and has hurt many small businesses. Meta has not yet publicly addressed the issue, despite attention from press and other high-profile creators.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nWhile Meta\u2019s newest crackdown is focused more on accounts that steal others\u2019 content for profit, issues around unoriginal content are growing.\nWith the rise of AI technology, platforms have become flooded with AI slop, a term referencing low-quality media content made using generative AI. On YouTube, for instance, it\u2019s easy to find an AI voice overlaid on photos, video clips, or other repurposed content, thanks to text-to-video AI tools.\nMeta\u2019s update seemingly only focuses on reused content, but its post suggests that it may be taking AI slop into consideration, too. In a section where the company offers \u201ctips\u201d for making original content, Meta notes that creators shouldn\u2019t just be \u201cstitching together clips\u201d or adding their watermark when using content from other sources, and they should focus on \u201cauthentic storytelling,\u201d not short videos offering little value.\nWithout directly saying so, these types of unoriginal videos are also things that AI tools have made it easier to produce, as low-quality videos will often feature a series of just images or clips (either real or AI), with added AI narration.\nIn the post, Meta also warns creators not to reuse content from other apps or sources, which has been a longstanding rule. It also notes that video captions should be high quality, which could mean cutting down on the use of automated AI captions that aren\u2019t edited by the creator.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta says these changes will roll out gradually over the months ahead, so Facebook creators have time to adjust. If creators think their content isn\u2019t being distributed, they can view the new post-level insights in Facebook\u2019s Professional Dashboard to see why.\nCreators will also be able to see if they\u2019re at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties in the Support home screen from their Page or professional profile\u2019s main menu.\nMeta typically shares information about its content takedowns in its quarterly Transparency Reports. In the last quarter, Meta said that 3% of its worldwide monthly active users on Facebook were fake accounts, and it had taken action on 1 billion fake accounts from January through March 2025.\nMore recently, Meta has backed away from fact-checking content itself in favor of Community Notes in the U.S., similar to X, which allows users and contributors to determine if posts follow Meta\u2019s Community Standards and are accurate.\n\ntitle3:\nEpisource is notifying millions of people that their health data was stolen\ndescription3:\nMedical billing giant Episource is notifying millions of people across the United States that their personal and health information was stolen in a cyberattack earlier this year.\nThe breach affects more than 5.4 million people, according to a listing with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, making it one of the largest healthcare breaches of the year so far.\nEpisource, owned by health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group\u2019s subsidiary Optum, provides billing adjustment to the doctors, hospitals, and other organizations that work in the healthcare industry. As such, the company handles large amounts of patients\u2019 personal and medical data to process claims through their health insurance.\nIn notices filed in California and Vermont on Friday, Episource said a criminal was able to \u201csee and take copies\u201d of patient and member data from its systems during the weeklong breach ending February 6.\nThe stolen information includes personal information, such as names, postal and email addresses, and phone numbers, as well as protected health data, including medical record numbers, and data relating to doctors, diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging, care, and other treatment. The stolen data also contains health insurance information, like health plans, policies, and member numbers.\nEpisource did not describe the nature of the incident, but Sharp Healthcare, one of the companies that works with Episource and was affected by the cyberattack, told its customers that the Episource hack was caused by ransomware.\nThis is the latest cybersecurity incident to hit UnitedHealth in recent years.\nChange Healthcare, one of the largest companies in the U.S. healthcare industry that processes billions of health transactions each year, was hacked by a ransomware gang in February 2024, leading to the theft of more than 190 million Americans\u2019 personal and health information. The cyberattack was the largest healthcare data breach in U.S. history.\nSeveral months later, UnitedHealth\u2019s Optum unit left exposed to the internet an internal chatbot used by employees to ask about claims.\n\ntitle4:\nCognition, maker of the AI coding agent Devin, acquires Windsurf\ndescription4:\nCognition, the startup behind the viral AI coding agent Devin, announced in a blog post on Monday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire AI coding startup Windsurf.\nThe announcement comes just days after Google hired away Windsurf\u2019s CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and research leaders in a $2.4 billion reverse-acquihire that left much of the startup\u2019s 250-person team behind. Google\u2019s deal occurred just hours after OpenAI\u2019s $3 billion offer to acquire Windsurf expired, clearing the way for the AI coding startup to explore other options.\nThe frenzy around Windsurf represents a new peak in the wild race to develop AI coding tools \u2014 specifically, the AI-powered integrated development environments (IDEs) that Cursor and Windsurf offer. In recent months, the businesses around AI-powered IDEs have skyrocketed, pushing Cursor\u2019s annualized recurring revenue (ARR) to $500 million. While Windsurf\u2019s business is smaller than Cursor\u2019s, it has achieved impressive growth in the last year, garnering interest from several larger companies.\n\u201cThe last 72 hours have been the wildest rollercoaster ride of my career,\u201d said Jeff Wang, Windsurf\u2019s former head of business, who was made interim CEO of the startup days ago after Google hired the startup\u2019s leaders, in a post on LinkedIn. \u201cTo our new teammates at Cognition: we at Windsurf feel incredibly lucky to be joining a team that shares our vision, our deep commitment to our users, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 our values.\u201d\nCognition says it\u2019s acquiring Windsurf\u2019s IP and product, which include its AI-powered IDE, alongside all of the employees who were not hired by Google.\nCognition did not announce the price it acquired Windsurf for; however, the company says Windsurf reached $82 million in ARR, with enterprise ARR doubling quarter-over-quarter. Cognition says Windsurf\u2019s user base reached at least 350 enterprise customers and \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of daily active users.\nIn the near term, Windsurf\u2019s team will continue working on its AI-powered IDE, while Cognition works on its AI coding agent, Devin, the companies said in a press release. Eventually, Cognition says it will integrate Windsurf\u2019s IP and capabilities into its own products.\nTechCrunch reported in April that Windsurf\u2019s ARR had reached $100 million at one point. However, Anthropic \u2014 which offers some of the most popular AI models for coding tasks \u2014 cut Windsurf\u2019s direct access to its Claude AI models in June, with Anthropic co-founder Jared Kaplan attributing the decision to rumors that OpenAI, its largest competitor, was close to acquiring Windsurf. Several Windsurf customers told TechCrunch they switched to other services that offered Claude AI models, such as Cursor, in light of the incident.\nCognition notes in its press release that Windsurf will now have full access to Claude AI models once again.\nOver the weekend, The Information reported that Windsurf employees who had joined in the last year did not receive a payout in Google\u2019s billion-dollar reverse-acquihire. That prompted many users on social media to scoff at the deal, which seemed to largely benefit investors and leaders at the startup.\nCognition president Russell Kaplan indicated in a post on X that the Windsurf acquisition truly came together over the weekend, just hours after the Google deal was made public. He noted that the first call was made after 5 p.m. on Friday and that an agreement was signed Monday morning.\nIncredibly excited to share that Cognition is acquiring Windsurf. What an insane weekend \u2013 from first call after 5pm on Friday to a signed definitive agreement this morning. There\u2019s a lot to build! https://t.co/UxwOG3QHVg \u2014 Russell Kaplan (@russelljkaplan) July 14, 2025\nCognition notes in its blog post that 100% of Windsurf employees will participate financially in this deal and have vesting cliffs waived for their work to date.\nWith the addition of Windsurf\u2019s talent and IP, Cognition may have a supercharged startup to compete with giants in the AI coding space, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cursor. In March, Cognition reportedly held talks to raise hundreds of millions of dollars at a $4 billion valuation. It\u2019s unclear if the round closed, but Cognition may need such a war chest to compete in the AI coding space.\nCognition was one of the first AI startups to launch a fully fledged AI coding agent, Devin, which didn\u2019t just help with tasks, but also promised to automate them completely as if it were a junior software engineer. This was a markedly bold approach compared to Cursor and Windsurf, which offered environments for developers to easily access AI tools. However, early reviews found that Devin made mistakes, perhaps indicating that its AI agent technology was ahead of its time.\nThat may no longer be the case. In recent months, Cursor and Windsurf have started offering more agentic AI products that are starting to resemble what Cognition offers. In a recent interview, Cursor CEO Michael Truell said he believes AI reasoning models are advancing enough to make coding agents viable and that he expects 20% of coding workflows to be handled by agents by 2026.\nNow Cognition has the versatility of offering both AI coding agents and an AI-powered IDE, perhaps enhancing its value proposition. Earlier this week, Cognition also landed a major customer in the Wall Street juggernaut Goldman Sachs.\nWith the acquisition of Windsurf, it seems Cognition has become a more serious competitor in the AI coding space.\"\n\nResponse:",
