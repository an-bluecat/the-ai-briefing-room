Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) previously raised a $1.8 billion round in 2021.\nFusion power has long been promised as a nearly limitless energy source, though it wasn\u2019t until recently that investors considered it a bet worth placing. As advances in computing and AI have quickened the pace of research and development, the sector has become a hotbed of startup and investor activity.\nInside a fusion reaction, atoms are compressed and heated until they form a fourth state of matter known as plasma. When the plasma reaches the right temperature and pressure, those atoms begin to fuse, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process.\nCFS is currently building a prototype reactor called Sparc in a Boston suburb. The company expects to turn that device on later next year and achieve scientific breakeven in 2027, a milestone in which the fusion reaction produces more energy than was required to ignite it.\nThough Sparc isn\u2019t designed to sell power to the grid, it\u2019s still vital to CFS\u2019s success.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cThere are parts of the modeling and the physics that we don\u2019t yet understand,\u201d Saskia Mordijck, an associate professor of physics at the College of William and Mary, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s always an open question when you turn on a completely new device that it might go into plasma regimes we\u2019ve never been into, that maybe we uncover things that we just did not expect.\u201d\nAssuming Sparc doesn\u2019t reveal any major problems, CFS expects to begin construction on Arc, its commercial-scale power plant, in Virginia starting in 2027 or 2028.\nThe Sparc and Arc designs are both tokamaks, a type of fusion reactor that uses powerful superconducting magnets to confine and compress plasma. Tokamaks are well known among the research community.\n\u201cWe know that this kind of idea should work,\u201d Mordijck said. \u201cThe question is naturally, how will it perform?\u201d\nInvestors appear to like what they\u2019ve seen so far. The list of participants in the Series B2 round is lengthy. No single investor led the round, and a number of existing investors increased their stakes, said Ally Yost, CFS\u2019s senior vice president of corporate development.\nExisting investors that increased their stakes include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Eni, Future Ventures, Gates Frontier, Google, Hostplus, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Safar Partners, Eric Schmidt, Starlight Ventures, and Tiger Global.\nThe new investors include Brevan Howard, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Counterpoint Global, Stanley Druckenmiller, FFA Private Bank in Dubai, Galaxy Interactive, Gigascale Capital, HOF Capital, Neva SGR, Nvidia\u2019s NVentures, Planet First Partners, Woori Venture Partners US, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation.\nSuch a broad base of investors may prove helpful as the company develops its supply chain and searches for partners to build its power plants and buy electricity from them. So far, the company has inked a deal with Google to buy 200 megawatts from Arc.\nAs the first of its kind, Arc is likely to cost more than subsequent power plants, Mordijck said.\nAnd while Sparc will help prove the science is sound, it will do more than that for CFS, Mumgaard told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s very important. But it\u2019s also to know the capabilities that you need to be able to deliver it. It\u2019s also to have the receipts, know what these things cost.\u201d\nThe new round will help CFS make progress on Sparc, but it will not be enough to build Arc, which will likely cost several billion dollars, Mumgaard said. At this point, the company doesn\u2019t know exactly what shape the funding for Arc will take.\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a first of a kind technology is a wrinkle that then has a big impact on where the capital will come from,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure, but we are pretty committed to doing this. And our investors are pretty committed to doing this.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nTransUnion says hackers stole 4.4 million customers' personal information\ndescription1:\nCredit reporting giant TransUnion has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 4.4 million customers\u2019 personal information.\nIn a filing with Maine\u2019s attorney general\u2019s office on Thursday, TransUnion attributed the July 28 breach to unauthorized access of a third-party application storing customers\u2019 personal data for its U.S. consumer support operations.\nTransUnion claimed \u201cno credit information was accessed,\u201d but provided no immediate evidence for its claim. The data breach notice did not specify what specific types of personal data were stolen.\nIn a separate data breach disclosure filed later on Thursday with Texas\u2019 attorney general\u2019s office, TransUnion confirmed that the stolen personal information includes customers\u2019 names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, TransUnion spokesperson Jon Boughtin would not answer questions related to the company\u2019s data breach, or say what types of customers\u2019 personally identifiable information were taken.\nTransUnion is one of the largest credit reporting agencies in the United States, and stores the financial data of more than 260 million Americans. It\u2019s the latest U.S. corporate giant to have been hacked in recent weeks following a wave of hacks targeting the insurance, retail, and transportation and airline industries.\nSeveral companies, including Google, insurance giant Allianz Life, Cisco, and HR giant Workday, reported data breaches of customer data stored in their Salesforce-hosted cloud databases. Following its breach, Google attributed the hacks to an extortion group known as ShinyHunters.\nIt\u2019s not clear who is behind the breach at TransUnion, or if the hackers made any demands to the company.\nUpdated with a response from TransUnion, and updated with additional details from the Texas state filing.\n\ntitle2:\nMark Cuban's war on America's $5 trillion healthcare machine: 'They can't react as quickly'\ndescription2:\nBillionaire entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban thinks America\u2019s healthcare industry is broken, and he\u2019s not mincing words about it.\n\u201cNo one looks at the financial side of healthcare and says, \u2018This is the way it should work,\u2019\u201d Cuban said on this week\u2019s episode of the Equity podcast. \u201cWhen you go to the doctor and you get a prescription . . . you have no idea what the cost to you is going to be. You don\u2019t know if you can afford it or not.\u201d\nThe former \u201cShark Tank\u201d host and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team explained the root of the problem: Most drug prices today are set by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), or third parties that manage prescription drug programs. Cuban said drug prices are opaque by design.\nThat\u2019s exactly why he launched Cost Plus Drugs in 2022 \u2014 to pull back the curtain on drug pricing, bring down costs to the average consumer, and disrupt the traditional pharmacy industry.\n\u201cThey price to market; we price based off of cost,\u201d he said.\nThe difference is shocking. For example, a generic chemotherapy drug might cost thousands over the counter at a pharmacy, whereas it might cost \u201c$21 from Cost Plus Drugs,\u201d Cuban said.\nCuban\u2019s approach is vastly different from how drugs are traditionally priced in the U.S. As its name suggests, Cost Plus Drugs sells meds directly to consumers at a transparent price \u2014 the manufacturer\u2019s cost, plus a 15% markup, plus a $5 pharmacy fee, plus shipping.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re adding the ability to pick it up in a local pharmacy,\u201d Cuban added.\nTo understand why Cuban\u2019s model is disruptive, it helps to know why drugs cost so much in the first place. The industry has defended its practice of overcharging for medication in the U.S. \u2014 which is one of the only high-income countries whose government doesn\u2019t set or negotiate drug prices \u2014 by arguing that without the incentive of high profits, companies couldn\u2019t invest the billions of dollars needed to bring new drugs to market.\nBut critics argue that prices are set to maximize profit and aren\u2019t directly tied to R&D costs. One 2021 study found that revenue from the top 20 best-selling drugs alone was enough for companies to wring a return from their R&D costs with billions left over.\nCuban also pointed out another reason that drug prices skyrocket in the U.S.: artificial shortages. \u201cBelieve it or not, in this day and age, there are things like pediatric cancer drugs, Pitocin, sterile water, [and] this long list of drugs I can\u2019t even pronounce right, that go in short supply because the manufacturers want them to go in short supply, because that\u2019s how they jack up the price,\u201d Cuban said.\nWhile there\u2019s limited direct evidence of intentional profiteering, it is true that during shortages, prices rise significantly.\nHis answer? Build his own factory. Cuban has a manufacturing plant in Dallas that\u2019s \u201call robotics driven.\u201d\n\u201cWe created this factory where we can turn over a new drug in four hours and ship it out to hospitals,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re starting to attack those shortages.\u201d\nWhile shipping drugs to patients has razor-thin margins, other aspects of Cost Plus Drugs, like drug manufacturing, are more profitable and help the business work toward profitability. Manufacturing is also another way to challenge the drug supply chain.\nBut Cuban\u2019s strategy goes beyond just offering cheaper drugs \u2014 he says he\u2019s refusing to play by the rules entirely. \u201cEverybody was saying . . . you can\u2019t fight these big companies, the insurance carriers, the PBMs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Well, I just won\u2019t work with them. I\u2019m not going to work the way they want to do it, because that\u2019s not what\u2019s best aligned for patients.\u201d\nEven Amazon, Cuban noted, fell into this trap. The tech giant has partnered with PBMs through Amazon Pharmacy, but that puts the big tech firm at a disadvantage because it\u2019s still \u201cbeholden to PBMs.\u201d\nHis advice to founders trying to take down incumbents?\n\u201cDon\u2019t be dependent on them,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if I were 25 and starting this business, I probably would work through the pharmacy benefit managers because that\u2019s where the money is. All of healthcare is basically an arbitrage. How can I just get a small percentage of a $5 trillion market through technology, pricing, whatever it may be?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I started out, somebody told me this: \u2018When you run with the elephants, there\u2019s the quick and the dead,\u2019\u201d Cuban said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be quick, or you\u2019re going to be dead, and so you\u2019ve got to be lean, mean. You\u2019ve got to be able to adapt. You\u2019ve got to be able to zig and zag and always look for ways to just do better, because it\u2019s the whole Innovator\u2019s Dilemma thing for [the incumbents], right? They\u2019ve got to protect their legacy businesses, but they can\u2019t move as quickly. They can\u2019t react as quickly, and so that\u2019s always going to give the founder an edge.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAnthropic users face a new choice - opt out or share your chats for AI training\ndescription3:\nAnthropic is making some big changes to how it handles user data, requiring all Claude users to decide by September 28 whether they want their conversations used to train AI models. While the company directed us to its blog post on the policy changes when asked about what prompted the move, we\u2019ve formed some theories of our own.\nBut first, what\u2019s changing: Previously, Anthropic didn\u2019t use consumer chat data for model training. Now, the company wants to train its AI systems on user conversations and coding sessions, and it said it\u2019s extending data retention to five years for those who don\u2019t opt out.\nThat is a massive update. Previously, users of Anthropic\u2019s consumer products were told that their prompts and conversation outputs would be automatically deleted from Anthropic\u2019s back end within 30 days \u201cunless legally or policy\u2011required to keep them longer\u201d or their input was flagged as violating its policies, in which case a user\u2019s inputs and outputs might be retained for up to two years.\nBy consumer, we mean the new policies apply to Claude Free, Pro, and Max users, including those using Claude Code. Business customers using Claude Gov, Claude for Work, Claude for Education, or API access will be unaffected, which is how OpenAI similarly protects enterprise customers from data training policies.\nSo why is this happening? In that post about the update, Anthropic frames the changes around user choice, saying that by not opting out, users will \u201chelp us improve model safety, making our systems for detecting harmful content more accurate and less likely to flag harmless conversations.\u201d Users will \u201calso help future Claude models improve at skills like coding, analysis, and reasoning, ultimately leading to better models for all users.\u201d\nIn short, help us help you. But the full truth is probably a little less selfless.\nLike every other large language model company, Anthropic needs data more than it needs people to have fuzzy feelings about its brand. Training AI models requires vast amounts of high-quality conversational data, and accessing millions of Claude interactions should provide exactly the kind of real-world content that can improve Anthropic\u2019s competitive positioning against rivals like OpenAI and Google.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBeyond the competitive pressures of AI development, the changes would also seem to reflect broader industry shifts in data policies, as companies like Anthropic and OpenAI face increasing scrutiny over their data retention practices. OpenAI, for instance, is currently fighting a court order that forces the company to retain all consumer ChatGPT conversations indefinitely, including deleted chats, because of a lawsuit filed by The New York Times and other publishers.\nIn June, OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap called this \u201ca sweeping and unnecessary demand\u201d that \u201cfundamentally conflicts with the privacy commitments we have made to our users.\u201d The court order affects ChatGPT Free, Plus, Pro, and Team users, though enterprise customers and those with Zero Data Retention agreements are still protected.\nWhat\u2019s alarming is how much confusion all of these changing usage policies are creating for users, many of whom remain oblivious to them.\nIn fairness, everything is moving quickly now, so as the tech changes, privacy policies are bound to change. But many of these changes are fairly sweeping and mentioned only fleetingly amid the companies\u2019 other news. (You wouldn\u2019t think Tuesday\u2019s policy changes for Anthropic users were very big news based on where the company placed this update on its press page.)\nImage Credits:Anthropic\nBut many users don\u2019t realize the guidelines to which they\u2019ve agreed have changed because the design practically guarantees it. Most ChatGPT users keep clicking on \u201cdelete\u201d toggles that aren\u2019t technically deleting anything. Meanwhile, Anthropic\u2019s implementation of its new policy follows a familiar pattern.\nHow so? New users will choose their preference during signup, but existing users face a pop-up with \u201cUpdates to Consumer Terms and Policies\u201d in large text and a prominent black \u201cAccept\u201d button with a much tinier toggle switch for training permissions below in smaller print \u2014 and automatically set to \u201cOn.\u201d\nAs observed earlier today by The Verge, the design raises concerns that users might quickly click \u201cAccept\u201d without noticing they\u2019re agreeing to data sharing.\nMeanwhile, the stakes for user awareness couldn\u2019t be higher. Privacy experts have long warned that the complexity surrounding AI makes meaningful user consent nearly unattainable. Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission even stepped in, warning that AI companies risk enforcement action if they engage in \u201csurreptitiously changing its terms of service or privacy policy, or burying a disclosure behind hyperlinks, in legalese, or in fine print.\u201d\nWhether the commission \u2014 now operating with just three of its five commissioners \u2014 still has its eye on these practices today is an open question, one we\u2019ve put directly to the FTC.\n\ntitle4:\nMathGPT.ai, the \u2018cheat-proof\u2019 tutor and teaching assistant, expands to over 50 institutions\ndescription4:\nAs AI becomes more prevalent in the classroom \u2014 where students use it to complete assignments and teachers are uncertain about how to address it \u2014 an AI platform called MathGPT.ai launched last year with the goal of providing an \u201canti-cheating\u201d tutor to college students and a teaching assistant to professors.\nFollowing a successful pilot program at 30 colleges and universities in the U.S., MathGPT.ai is preparing to nearly double its availability this fall, with hundreds of instructors planning to incorporate the tool. Schools implementing MathGPT.ai in their classrooms include Penn State University, Tufts University, and Liberty University, among others.\nThe most notable aspect of the platform is that its AI chatbot is trained to never directly give the answer, but instead ask students questions and provide support, much like a human tutor would. This technique, known as Socratic questioning, encourages students to think critically rather than simply memorizing answers.\nFor instructors, MathGPT.ai serves as a teaching assistant, generating questions and schoolwork based on uploaded textbooks and learning materials, as well as offering auto-grading capabilities and additional AI features.\nMathGPT.ai supports college-level math, including Algebra, Calculus, Trigonometry, and more.\nImage Credits:MathGPT\nIn addition to the expansion, MathGPT.ai launched an upgraded version of its platform, introducing new features that give professors more control over how their students use the tools.\nThe main feature that sets MathGPT.ai apart from other AI companies is its instructor-centric approach. Recently, the platform has become even more focused on instructors\u2019 needs. For example, instructors can now determine when students are allowed to interact with the chatbot. They can specify whether the AI should provide tutoring support for specific assignments while encouraging students to work independently on others.\nAnother new feature allows professors to set the number of attempts a student has to answer a question correctly. To promote a low-pressure learning environment, MathGPT.ai has also introduced unlimited practice questions for students. These questions don\u2019t affect their score, allowing students to test their knowledge without stressing about grades.\nAdditional features that MathGPT.ai offers to instructors include an optional requirement for students to upload images of their work. This enables professors to review submissions and verify the authenticity of the students\u2019 work.\nOther recent updates include integrations with the three largest Learning Management Systems (LMS): Canvas, Blackboard, and Brightspace. It also added screen reader compatibility and an audio mode, making it more accessible to individuals with disabilities. The platform already offers closed captions for its summarized video lessons, which are notably AI-narrated to sound like historical figures like Ben Franklin and Albert Einstein.\nThe company claims it complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nImage Credits:MathGPT\nWhile chatbots like Meta AI, Character.AI, and ChatGPT have faced criticism for inappropriate interactions with young users, MathGPT.ai says it has strict guardrails in place to ensure a safe learning environment.\n\u201cIt will not have discussions with you about your girlfriend, boyfriend, or the meaning of life,\u201d Peter Relan, the chairman of MathGPT.ai, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt will simply not engage. Because these freestanding chatbots will go in that direction, right? We are not here to entertain those kinds of conversations.\u201d (Relan helped incubate Got It AI and was an early Discord investor.)\nIt\u2019s important to note that, like any chatbot, MathGPT.ai\u2019s assistant still has the potential to produce inaccurate information. The chatbot has a disclosure at the bottom that warns the AI may make mistakes. Users can report the responses to the company if they believe the questions were answered incorrectly.\n\u201cIf you find a mistake, we will reward you with a gift card to tell us what it is. Year one, there were five [hallucinations]. Year two, there was one. So far [this year], none. So we take it very seriously,\u201d Relan said, adding that MathGPT.ai has a team of human annotators to double-check every piece of work, textbook, and all other content to ensure \u201c100% accuracy.\u201d\nTo continue its growth, the company plans to develop a mobile app in the future and expand to more subjects, such as chemistry, economics, and accounting.\nMathGPT.ai offers a free option, as well as a $25 per student per course option. The paid option includes several benefits, such as unlimited AI assignments and LMS integration.\"\n\nResponse:",
