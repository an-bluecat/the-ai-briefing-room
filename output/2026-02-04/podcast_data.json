Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday February 5), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAlphabet won't talk about the Google-Apple AI deal, even to investors\ndescription0:\nAlphabet declined to answer one of its investors during questions about Google\u2019s AI deal with Apple on Wednesday\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call. Instead of responding to an analyst\u2019s question about how the tech giant is thinking about AI partnerships, such as the one with Apple to power AI for Siri, the question was completely ignored.\nThat decision tells us something, though \u2014 Alphabet isn\u2019t ready to talk about how this partnership will impact its core business, which is increasingly focused on AI.\nOver the years, the Google-Apple relationship has been mutually beneficial. The two companies\u2019 search partnership saw the search giant paying the iPhone maker $20 billion to be the default search engine on Apple devices, filings from the Department of Justice\u2019s lawsuit against the search giant revealed. In turn, Google gained access to Apple\u2019s massive customer base \u2014 the iPhone maker last quarter announced it has 2.5 billion active devices worldwide, to give you an idea of scale.\nThe latest Apple AI deal is rumored to cost Apple roughly $1 billion per year, but the payoff beyond that for Google isn\u2019t as immediately obvious as it is with search. In Google Search, consumers see links to advertisers\u2019 websites at the top of their search results. Ads in AI Mode, which could one day represent the future of Google\u2019s search business, are still an \u201cexperiment\u201d for now.\nThe company first announced last May that it would bring ads to AI Mode, the chatbot-style interface for Google Search, but these tests see the ads\u2019 placement below or integrated into the chatbot\u2019s responses. Google is also trying out agentic shopping, including Shop with AI Mode, to guide consumers with product-related queries to a seamless checkout experience from the AI interface.\nMeanwhile, Google\u2019s AI competitor Anthropic is taking aim at ad-supported AI with its forthcoming Super Bowl ad, which challenges the business model being adopted by ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Google.\nHow this will all play out longer-term is still an open question \u2014 and for today, an unanswered one, apparently.\nOverall, the Apple Siri deal barely received any mention during Alphabet\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday. Sundar Pichai only noted he was pleased that Apple\u2019s \u201cpreferred cloud provider\u201d and would be helping to develop \u201cthe next generation of Apple foundation models based on Gemini technology.\u201d Google\u2019s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler used the exact same wording when mentioning Apple, as well.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini app has surpassed 750M monthly active users\ndescription1:\nGoogle\u2019s AI chatbot Gemini has surpassed 750 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to the company\u2019s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings. This figure illustrates the rapid consumer adoption of Gemini, which has quickly become a prominent player in the AI space.\nLast quarter, Google reported 650 million monthly active users for Gemini, indicating substantial growth in a short period. In comparison, Meta AI has reported nearly 500 million monthly users. However, while Gemini is gaining traction, it still trails behind its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which is estimated to have around 810 million MAUs in late 2025.\nThe recently revealed number comes on the heels of the launch of Gemini 3, which showcases the company\u2019s most advanced model yet, providing responses that the company claims exhibit an unprecedented level of depth and nuance.\nCEO Sundar Pichai highlighted that the introduction of Gemini 3 in AI mode was a \u201cpositive driver\u201d for the company\u2019s growth and emphasized that continued investment and iteration will maintain this momentum.\nGoogle recently rolled out a more affordable plan, the Google AI Plus, priced at $7.99 per month. The plan is expected to drive further growth by appealing to budget-conscious consumers, although it was made available too recently to have any influence on the quarterly figures.\n\u201cWe are focused on a free tier and subscriptions and seeing great growth,\u201d Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, said during the call to investors.\nGemini\u2019s growth is particularly notable given Alphabet\u2019s overall financial performance. The company has surpassed $400 billion in annual revenue for the first time this quarter. Google attributes the achievement to the expansion of its AI division, which has seen increased demand. Recently, Google introduced the latest generation of its TPU AI accelerator chip, called Ironwood, to compete with Nvidia.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cThe launch of Gemini 3 was a major milestone, and we have great momentum. Our first party models, like Gemini, now process over 10 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers, and the Gemini App has grown to over 750 million monthly active users. Search saw more usage than ever before, with AI continuing to drive an expansionary moment,\u201d Pichai stated in today\u2019s release.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon to begin testing AI tools for film and TV production next month\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nLast summer, Amazon MGM Studios launched a dedicated AI Studio to develop proprietary AI tools to streamline TV and film production, with a focus on areas like improving character consistency across shots and supporting pre- and post-production.\nAccording to a report from Reuters, those tools are now ready to move beyond internal testing. Amazon will begin a closed beta program in March, inviting industry partners to try out its AI tools.\nAmazon said it anticipates sharing initial outcomes from the program by May. The company chose not to provide further details on the developments when approached by TechCrunch for a comment.\nThe AI Studio is collaborating with notable producers like Robert Stromberg, known for \u201cMaleficent,\u201d Kunal Nayyar from \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d and former animator Colin Brady from Pixar to learn the best way to implement these tools. Amazon is also tapping Amazon Web Services for support and intends to work with several LLM providers.\nAlbert Cheng, who heads the AI Studios initiative, emphasized that the goal is to support creative teams, not to replace them. The focus is on improving efficiency and reducing costs while ensuring that intellectual property is protected and AI-generated content isn\u2019t absorbed into other AI models. One example used is Amazon\u2019s \u201cHouse of David\u201d series, which featured 350 AI-generated shots in season two.\n\u200bHowever, the rise of adoption of AI in Hollywood has stirred up plenty of debate. Many people in the industry worry about what it means for jobs, creativity, and the future of filmmaking.\nThe conversations around AI are only getting louder as more companies experiment with these new tools. For instance, Netflix has also jumped on the AI bandwagon, with co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealing that its series \u201cThe Eternaut\u201d used generative AI to create a building collapse scene.\nIn recent years, Amazon has cited its success with AI as a factor in layoffs. The company recently eliminated 16,000 jobs in January, following 14,000 layoffs last October.\n\ntitle3:\nMundi Ventures closes on \u20ac750M for Kembara, its largest deep tech and climate fund\ndescription3:\nEurope invests billions into early-stage climate startups, only to watch too many fail at Series B, according to a recent report. But new funds are being raised to fill this gap, and Spain-based Mundi Ventures\u2019 latest fund, Kembara Fund I, is one of them.\nAfter securing a \u20ac350 million commitment from the European Investment Fund under the European Tech Champions Initiative in 2024, Mundi Ventures has just completed a \u20ac750 million first close for Kembara, its fifth fund and largest to date.\nRegulatory filing from Spain reveals that the fund \u2014 focused on deep tech \u2014 could even stretch its final closing to \u20ac1.25 billion. But according to Kembara co-founder and general partner Yann de Vries, getting to \u20ac750 million in two years as a first fund in this environment \u201cwas not easy.\u201d\nKembara is managed by a specialist team within Mundi Ventures, with offices in Madrid, London, Barcelona, and Paris. Mundi Ventures founder Javier Santiso is now also a co-founder and GP of the Kembara fund, which has now disclosed the full list of its senior partners.\nAlongside de Vries and Santiso, climate tech VC Robert Trezona and deep tech VC Pierre Festal have also joined as general partners, as well as former Atomico partner Siraj Khaliq as senior strategic advisor.\nTheir individual track records helped them raise funds from institutional backers waking up to the need for European growth capital that can turn its many university spinouts into sizable businesses with industrial synergies. But it also gave them a front-row seat into the broader growing pains of European climate and deep tech startups \u2014 especially de Vries.\nA seasoned venture capitalist who founded Redpoint eVentures Brazil and later became a partner at Atomico, de Vries had moved to the other side of the table to join German electric aircraft startup Lilium \u2014 only for the company to cease operations in 2024 after raising more than $1 billion and going public via a SPAC.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Walk away with tactics you can apply immediately\nSave up to $300 on your pass or save up to 30% with group tickets for teams of four or more. Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nIn de Vries\u2019 view, Lilium went bankrupt because it couldn\u2019t find the growth capital it needed, but this \u201ctraumatizing experience\u201d also had a silver lining. \u201cI saw so many amazing teams in Europe that were going through the same journey,\u201d he said. \u201c[Europe] doesn\u2019t have an innovation problem. It doesn\u2019t have a startup problem. The problem it has is a scale-up problem.\u201d\nKembara\u2019s sweet spot will be Series B and C rounds, with plans to write initial checks from \u20ac15 million to \u20ac40 million into some 20 companies. But the fund\u2019s size leaves room for follow-ons to help portfolio startups scale manufacturing and expand globally, and total investments could go up to \u20ac100 million per company.\nThat\u2019s more than the full size of many European funds, though this may be changing: deep tech VC firm Elaia and asset manager Lazard teamed up to form LEC (Lazard Elaia Capital), whose initial investments will range between \u20ac20 million and \u20ac60 million per company, while operator-led fund Plural is reportedly raising a new fund of up to \u20ac1 billion.\nStill, the capital-intensive nature of most climate and deep tech growth-stage companies means that even large VC checks can only go so far. One lesson de Vries learned from Lilium is that raising only in equity is very hard, and even puts companies in a hard spot later on. This inspired Kembara to take a different approach to financing.\n\u201cSeveral of us have lived through this, and what we want to do now is to productize non-dilutive financing for these deep tech founders to help them de-risk their future financing and optimize the capital structure to minimize dilution. And we\u2019re bringing in [limited partners] who [\u2026] not only want to invest in the fund, but also want to coinvest in those winners,\u201d de Vries said.\nFor these LPs, geopolitics also plays a role in wanting to provide growth capital and venture debt to European growth-stage startups. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of support from sovereign wealth funds in Europe, from government, from corporations, to push and drive for building these European champions in deep tech out of Europe,\u201d de Vries predicted.\nThese geopolitical undertones are also reflected in Kembara\u2019s sector focus, which includes dual use and defense tech to \u201cprotect European sovereignty,\u201d according to a press release. However, de Vries pushed back against the idea that Kembara is simply replacing capital that later-stage European outfits could have raised abroad.\n\u201cThere are lots of gems that are under the radar in Europe, that could be scaling into global champions, and that are not realizing their full potential.\u201d He said DeepMind is a related example, \u201cwhere they were missing this growth capital and sold too early.\u201d (Google acquired the company for more than $500 million in 2014, but it is now estimated to be worth billions.)\nKeeping European companies European has gained urgency in many verticals that overlap with Kembara\u2019s thesis, such as quantum computing, semiconductors, and space tech. But its goal is to foster global champions that cross borders. Coincidentally, Kembara means \u201cto wander\u201d in Malaysian (although the team holds \u201cthe humble path to excellence\u201d as an older meaning).\nBeyond the name, Kembara has Malaysian connections. Santiso is also the former CEO for Europe of Malaysian sovereign wealth fund Khazanah; and doors could open as many countries examine their exposure to the U.S. \u201cIn the second close, we\u2019re going to be looking for global investors, because we want to have global access to markets, but also global access to supply chain,\u201d de Vries said.\n\ntitle4:\nElon Musk's SpaceX company town is getting a police department\ndescription4:\nStarbase, the company town that Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX created in South Texas, is forming its own police squad.\nThe city\u2019s commission approved an ordinance during a special meeting Tuesday that would create a municipal police department, subject to approval from the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE). The department will be run by a chief of police elected by the city\u2019s commission, and is expected to hire eight officers, according to local news outlet Valley Central. It could be up and running in a few months.\n\u201cThere is a lot of assets here with the operations of SpaceX,\u201d Starbase city administrator Kent Myers told the outlet. \u201cThose assets need to be protected, and so the police department will play a critical part in protecting those assets.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear if Starbase has submitted its application to the TCOLE yet. The city and the TCOLE did not respond to requests for comment. Starbase reportedly hired security consulting firm Vision Quest Solutions to build out the department.\nStarbase is where SpaceX makes and tests its prototype Starship rocket. The city is small \u2014 it is currently home to just a few hundred residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees (or family of those workers). But it is geographically isolated. The closest neighboring town is Brownsville, which is about 10 miles away, though the drive can take 45 minutes or longer.\nA police department would be the latest addition to public services that have become available in Starbase since it was incorporated as a city last year. In October, a handful of SpaceX employees who live at Starbase started a volunteer fire department. The city also created a fire marshal position and took on its own building inspections and permitting around that same time.\nStarbase initially tried to handle law enforcement within its city limits by contracting with the Cameron County sheriff\u2019s office. The city struck a $3.5 million, five-year contract with the sheriff\u2019s office that was supposed to see two deputies patrol the city at a time, with eight deputies overall assigned to the detail.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The company town agreed to pay $100 per day per inmate and to reimburse any additional expenses, like medical care.\nThe deal apparently has not worked out, though.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of success in finding deputies through the county, so we decided to change direction,\u201d Myers told Valley Central. That was apparently due in part to the contract not having civil service protections, Sheriff Manuel Trevi\u00f1o told the outlet.\"\n\nResponse:",
