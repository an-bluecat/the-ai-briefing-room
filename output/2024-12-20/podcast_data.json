Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The European Commission determined that if the merger went through, other hardware options compatible with Nvidia would still be available on the market and thus this company combination would not create a monopoly.\nDespite the EU approval, though, the deal is still being held up by the Department of Justice in the U.S. and it\u2019s unclear when/if it will be approved.\nStill, this is likely welcome news to other AI startups with acquisition and acqui-hire aspirations, as it shows consolidation is welcome in the AI market \u2014 at least for now.\nWhile the deal terms weren\u2019t disclosed, the purchase price is estimated to be around $700 million, according to Bloomberg\u2019s reporting that cites local Israeli media. The deal was originally announced in April.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI announces new o3 models\ndescription1:\nOpenAI saved its biggest announcement for the last day of its 12-day \u201cshipmas\u201d event.\nOn Friday, the company unveiled o3, the successor to the o1 \u201creasoning\u201d model it released earlier in the year. o3 is a model family, to be more precise \u2014 as was the case with o1. There\u2019s o3 and o3-mini, a smaller, distilled model fine-tuned for particular tasks.\nOpenAI makes the remarkable claim that o3, at least in certain conditions, approaches AGI \u2014 with significant caveats. More on that below.\nWhy call the new model o3, not o2? Well, trademarks may be to blame. According to The Information, OpenAI skipped o2 to avoid a potential conflict with British telecom provider O2. CEO Sam Altman somewhat confirmed this during a livestream this morning. Strange world we live in, isn\u2019t it?\nNeither o3 nor o3-mini are widely available yet, but safety researchers can sign up for a preview for o3-mini starting today. An o3 preview will arrive sometime after; OpenAI didn\u2019t specify when. Altman said that the plan is to launch o3-mini toward the end of January and follow with o3.\nThat conflicts a bit with his recent statements. In an interview this week, Altman said that, before OpenAI releases new reasoning models, he\u2019d prefer a federal testing framework to guide monitoring and mitigating the risks of such models.\nAnd there are risks. AI safety testers have found that o1\u2019s reasoning abilities make it try to deceive human users at a higher rate than conventional, \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d models \u2014 or, for that matter, leading AI models from Meta, Anthropic, and Google. It\u2019s possible that o3 attempts to deceive at an even higher rate than its predecessor; we\u2019ll find out once OpenAI\u2019s red-team partners release their testing results.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, OpenAI says that it\u2019s using a new technique, \u201cdeliberative alignment,\u201d to align models like o3 with its safety principles. (o1 was aligned the same way.) The company has detailed its work in a new study.\nReasoning steps\nUnlike most AI, reasoning models such as o3 effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models.\nThis fact-checking process incurs some latency. o3, like o1 before it, takes a little longer \u2014 usually seconds to minutes longer \u2014 to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside? It tends to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and mathematics.\no3 was trained via reinforcement learning to \u201cthink\u201d before responding via what OpenAI describes as a \u201cprivate chain of thought.\u201d The model can reason through a task and plan ahead, performing a series of actions over an extended period that help it figure out a solution.\nWe announced @OpenAI o1 just 3 months ago. Today, we announced o3. We have every reason to believe this trajectory will continue. pic.twitter.com/Ia0b63RXIk \u2014 Noam Brown (@polynoamial) December 20, 2024\nIn practice, given a prompt, o3 pauses before responding, considering a number of related prompts and \u201cexplaining\u201d its reasoning along the way. After a while, the model summarizes what it considers to be the most accurate response.\nNew with o3 versus o1 is the ability to \u201cadjust\u201d the reasoning time. The models can be set to low, medium, or high compute (i.e. thinking time). The higher the compute, the better o3 performs on a task.\nNo matter how much compute they have at their disposals, reasoning models such as o3 aren\u2019t flawless, however. While the reasoning component can reduce hallucinations and errors, it doesn\u2019t eliminate them. o1 trips up on games of tic-tac-toe, for instance.\nBenchmarks and AGI\nOne big question leading up to today was whether OpenAI might claim that its newest models are approaching AGI.\nAGI, short for \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d broadly refers to AI that can perform any task a human can. OpenAI has its own definition: \u201chighly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\u201d\nAchieving AGI would be a bold declaration. And it carries contractual weight for OpenAI, as well. According to the terms of its deal with close partner and investor Microsoft, once OpenAI reaches AGI, it\u2019s no longer obligated to give Microsoft access to its most advanced technologies (those that meet OpenAI\u2019s AGI definition, that is).\nGoing by one benchmark, OpenAI is slowly inching closer to AGI. On ARC-AGI, a test designed to evaluate whether an AI system can efficiently acquire new skills outside the data it was trained on, o3 achieved an 87.5% score on the high compute setting. At its worst (on the low compute setting), the model tripled the performance of o1.\nGranted, the high compute setting was exceedingly expensive \u2014 in the order of thousands of dollars per challenge, according to ARC-AGI co-creator Fran\u00e7ois Chollet.\nChollet also pointed out that o3 fails on \u201cvery easy tasks\u201d in ARC-AGI, indicating \u2014 in his opinion \u2014 that the model exhibits \u201cfundamental differences\u201d from human intelligence. He has previously noted the evaluation\u2019s limitations, and cautioned against using it as a measure of AI superintelligence.\n\u201c[E]arly data points suggest that the upcoming [successor to the ARC-AGI] benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart human would still be able to score over 95% with no training),\u201d Chollet continued in a statement. \u201cYou\u2019ll know AGI is here when the exercise of creating tasks that are easy for regular humans but hard for AI becomes simply impossible.\u201d\nIncidentally, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll partner with the foundation behind ARC-AGI to help it build the next generation of its AI benchmark, ARC-AGI 2.\nOn other tests, o3 blows away the competition.\nThe model outperforms o1 by 22.8 percentage points on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark focused on programming tasks, and achieves a Codeforces rating \u2014 another measure of coding skills \u2014 of 2727. (A rating of 2400 places an engineer at the 99.2nd percentile.) o3 scores 96.7% on the 2024 American Invitational Mathematics Exam, missing just one question, and achieves 87.7% on GPQA Diamond, a set of graduate-level biology, physics, and chemistry questions. Finally, o3 sets a new record on EpochAI\u2019s Frontier Math benchmark, solving 25.2% of problems; no other model exceeds 2%.\nThese claims have to be taken with a grain of salt, of course. They\u2019re from OpenAI\u2019s internal evaluations. We\u2019ll need to wait to see how the model holds up to benchmarking from outside customers and organizations in the future.\nA trend\nIn the wake of the release of OpenAI\u2019s first series of reasoning models, there\u2019s been an explosion of reasoning models from rival AI companies \u2014 including Google. In early November, DeepSeek, an AI research firm funded by quant traders, launched a preview of its first reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1. That same month, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen team unveiled what it claimed was the first \u201copen\u201d challenger to o1 (in the sense that it could be downloaded, fine-tuned, and run locally).\nWhat opened the reasoning model floodgates? Well, for one, the search for novel approaches to refine generative AI. As TechCrunch recently reported, \u201cbrute force\u201d techniques to scale up models are no longer yielding the improvements they once did.\nNot everyone\u2019s convinced that reasoning models are the best path forward. They tend to be expensive, for one, thanks to the large amount of computing power required to run them. And while they\u2019ve performed well on benchmarks so far, it\u2019s not clear whether reasoning models can maintain this rate of progress.\nInterestingly, the release of o3 comes as one of OpenAI\u2019s most accomplished scientists departs. Alec Radford, the lead author of the academic paper that kicked off OpenAI\u2019s \u201cGPT series\u201d of generative AI models (that is, GPT-3, GPT-4, and so on), announced this week that he\u2019s leaving to pursue independent research.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.\n\ntitle2:\nFeds clear the way for robotaxis without steering wheels and pedals\ndescription2:\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Friday proposed a new national framework that could make it easier for companies to deploy at scale autonomous vehicles without traditional manual driving controls \u2014 like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors.\nThe guidelines also require AV companies to share a whole lot more safety data with the agency.\nThe AV industry has been anticipating NHTSA\u2019s proposal since last year, when the agency first proposed the ADS-Equipped Vehicle Safety, Transparency and Evaluation Program, known as AV STEP. The program\u2019s goal, among other things, was to allow NHTSA to greenlight the sale and commercialization of autonomous vehicles that are not compliant with federal safety standards due to a lack of manual controls.\nToday, autonomous vehicles that have all their manual parts are allowed to operate on public roads without oversight from NHTSA. But any AVs that can\u2019t be taken over by a human driver have to get an exemption from the agency.\nUnless, of course, they\u2019re Zoox. The Amazon-owned company has maintained that it doesn\u2019t need an exemption from NHTSA because it has \u201cself-certified\u201d the safety of its vehicles \u2014 a claim that the agency is actively investigating.\nZoox, which recently started rolling out its toaster-like vehicles in San Francisco, isn\u2019t the only AV company looking to lose the steering wheel and pedals. Cruise, before it went under, planned to deploy the Origin, its purpose-built robotaxi, at scale. Electric and autonomous trucking company Einride intends to commercialize an AV freight pod that doesn\u2019t even have a cab for a driver, let alone pedals. And Tesla unveiled its two-door robotaxi prototype in October, which it plans to start production on in 2025 or 2026, according to CEO Elon Musk.\nNHTSA\u2019s proposed program is a voluntary one that would give participants \u201can opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to transparency for their vehicles and operations\u201d by providing regular reporting on safety.\nThe AV STEP program has two tiers \u2014 one for vehicles built with human controls, with fallback designs that can be managed by humans; and another for vehicles built without such controls. As more of the latter begin to flood public streets, NHTSA hopes the program and data reporting would make the agency better equipped to \u201caddress emerging risks associated with their deployment.\u201d\nTo qualify for the program, companies will need to submit data related to the safety of the \u201cdesign, development, and operations\u201d of their AVs. Once admitted, participants will be required to submit both periodic and event-triggered reports, like crash reports, to NHTSA \u2014 all of which the agency would be at liberty to publish in the name of transparency.\nNHTSA\u2019s call for more data comes as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team has signaled a desire to quash a Biden-era requirement for car-crash reporting that Musk and Tesla oppose. Tesla has the largest market share of vehicles with automated driving features in the U.S., and as such, the majority of the total reported crashes come from Teslas. Tesla has been targeted in several NHTSA investigations, some of which stemmed from the roughly 1,500 crashes the automaker reported to federal safety regulators.\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether crash reporting for AVs will be eliminated under Trump\u2019s regime, but NHTSA says it wants to collect such data so it can keep up with the fast-moving industry in anticipation of one day establishing minimum standards for AV performance.\nSome industry advocates say the proposed framework is premature. Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, pointed out that the proposal was released shortly after NHTSA issued a set of studies touting the effect of federal safety standards in saving over 860,000 lives from 1968 to 2019.\n\u201cExpanding the deployment of ADS \u2013 and without the safety protections provided by FMVSSs \u2013 at this time seems premature and lacks independent research and data to support the action,\u201d Chase said in a statement.\n\ntitle3:\nVCs pledge not to take money from Russia or China, and Databricks raises a humongous round\ndescription3:\nWelcome to Startups Weekly \u2014 your weekly recap of everything you can\u2019t miss from the world of startups. Want it in your inbox every Friday? Sign up here.\nThis week was full of news, likely because it is also the last \u201creal\u201d week of 2024. Which is another way for us to say goodbye for now, and see you in 2025!\nMost interesting startup stories from the week\nImage Credits:We Are / Getty Images\nThis week brought us some M&As, but also some reminders that it\u2019s always worth looking closer at things, whether that\u2019s prospective LPs or shiny announcements.\nClean capital: More than 20 VC firms, many of which invest in defense tech, signed the Clean Capital Certification, self-attesting that they have not and will not take money from U.S. geopolitical adversaries such as China and Russia.\nHave-nots: The AI hype is distorting aggregate VC data. Digging deeper, the fundraising landscape is radically different for non-AI startups, and many that raised a Series A round 18 months ago are likely facing challenges in raising Series B funding, Tribeca Venture Partners co-founder Brian Hirsch told TechCrunch.\nBig deal with caveats: Nuclear startup Oklo, which is backed by Sam Altman, signed a massive but nonbinding agreement with data center operator Switch. The deal is also subject to the startup receiving approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after having its previous application denied in 2022.\nAI productivity: Grammarly is acquiring productivity startup Coda to expand its scope. In an unusual move, Coda CEO and co-founder Shishir Mehrotra will become the new CEO of Grammarly, replacing Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, who will move on to an adviser role.\nInformed answers: Perplexity acquired Carbon, a Seattle-based startup that connects LLMs to external data before they generate an answer. This could help Perplexity tap into \u201cinternal databases, cloud storage, or document repositories,\u201d the company said.\nMost interesting fundraises this week\nAs startups rushed to disclose their latest fundraising news before the holidays, there were plenty of deal announcements this week.\nMammoth pre-IPO round: Databricks raised $10 billion in one of the largest rounds in VC history. The mammoth Series J might be its last fundraiser before its highly anticipated IPO; but while its CEO isn\u2019t ruling it out for 2025, it could also be in 2026, he said.\nAfrica\u2019s latest unicorn: South African fintech Tyme Group raised a $250 million Series D round. Led by Nu Holdings, the parent company of Latin American fintech Nubank, it put Tyme\u2019s valuation at $1.5 billion.\nRing maker: Finnish wearable startup Oura raised a $200 million Series D funding round at a $5.2 billion valuation. It included participation from Fidelity Management and glucose device maker Dexcom, with which Oura recently entered a partnership.\nTravel is back: Canadian travel startup Hostaway, which makes software for vacation rental operators, raised $365 million at a $925 million valuation. The round was led by General Atlantic and will help the company double down on growth.\nMomentum for accessibility: Evinced, which helps companies comply with online accessibility requirements, raised a $55 million Series C round to expand into Europe, where new regulations will take effect in June.\nFast funding: AI startup Decart, which is based in San Francisco but with operations in Israel, secured $32 million in fresh funding at a $500 million valuation, a mere two months after coming out of stealth.\nFind the money: Agave Games, the Turkish startup behind highly entertaining mobile game Find the Cat, raised an $18 million Series A round of funding it will use to build out its team and work on upcoming titles.\nMost interesting VC and fund news this week\nImage Credits:Axelle/Bauer-Griffin / FilmMagic / Getty Images\nPendulum swing: Marcy Venture Partners, Jay-Z\u2019s VC firm, merged with Pendulum Opportunities to form MarcyPen Capital Partners, which now has $900 million in assets under management.\nGoing backstage: Backstage Capital founder Arlan Hamilton announced that she\u2019s moving on to an advisory role; 360 Venture Collective will be \u201cacquiring a significant stake in Backstage\u2019s management entity\u201d and joining in co-managing operators and providing capital for the firm, which previously faced criticism and struggles.\nVote of confidence: G2 Venture Partners, a spinout of Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers investing in climate and sustainability startups, is raising $750 million for a third fund that would confirm LP bullishness for its thesis.\nLast but not least\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nWe\u2019re leaving you with a list of the 51 most disruptive startups of 2024 \u2014 a collective effort with contributions from several members of the TechCrunch team.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) called Musk an \"out of touch billionaire running the incoming Trump Administration\" who \"enthusiastically supports the neo-Nazi party in Germany.\"\n\"The AfD's mission is to rehabilitate the image of the Nazi movement,\" Murphy wrote. He added that one of the party's leaders has a license plate that's \"an open tribute to Hitler,\" and another \"described Judaism as the 'inner enemy' in Germany.\"\nMusk and Tesla's investor relations team didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nOn Friday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a center-left Social Democrat, dismissed Musk's claim that only the far-right party can \"save Germany.\"\nUnder Scholz's leadership, Germany's left-wing coalition collapsed in November, and AfD is currently polling in second place ahead of February elections. Throughout Germany, where the AfD has placed highly in state elections, the other parties have generally refused to form coalitions with it.\nAccording to Pew Research, \"AfD has campaigned against weapon deliveries to Ukraine and called for an end to sanctions on Russia,\" a view shared by Musk.\nFar right parties have also gained ground in the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and elsewhere.
