Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The company claims this is the first vision language action model focused on autonomous driving. Visual language models can process both text and images together, allowing vehicles to \u201csee\u201d their surroundings and make decisions based on what they perceive.\nThis new model is based on Nvidia\u2019s Cosmos-Reason model, a reasoning model that thinks through decisions before it responds. Nvidia initially released the Cosmos model family in January 2025. Additional models were released in August.\nTechnology like the Alpamayo-R1 is critical for companies looking to reach level 4 autonomous driving, which means full autonomy in a defined area and under specific circumstances, Nvidia said in a blog post.\nNvidia hopes that this type of reasoning model will give autonomous vehicles the \u201ccommon sense\u201d to better approach nuanced driving decisions like humans do.\nThis new model is available on GitHub and Hugging Face.\nAlongside the new vision model, Nvidia also uploaded new step-by-step guides, inference resources, and post-training workflows to GitHub \u2014 collectively called the Cosmos Cookbook \u2014 to help developers better use and train Cosmos models for their specific use cases. The guide covers data curation, synthetic data generation, and model evaluation.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThese announcements come as the company is pushing full-speed into physical AI as a new avenue for its advanced AI GPUs.\nNvidia\u2019s co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly said that the next wave of AI is physical AI. Bill Dally, Nvidia\u2019s chief scientist, echoed that sentiment in a conversation with TechCrunch over the summer, emphasizing physical AI in robotics.\n\u201cI think eventually robots are going to be a huge player in the world and we want to basically be making the brains of all the robots,\u201d Dally said at the time. \u201cTo do that, we need to start developing the key technologies.\u201d\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.\n\ntitle1:\nApple just named a new AI chief with Google and Microsoft expertise, as John Giannandrea steps down\ndescription1:\nIn a carefully worded announcement on Monday, Apple said John Giannandrea, who has been the company\u2019s AI chief since 2018, is \u201cstepping down\u201d to, well, not work at Apple anymore. He\u2019ll stick around through spring as an adviser.\nHis replacement is Amar Subramanya, a highly regarded Microsoft executive who spent 16 years at Google, most recently leading engineering for the Gemini Assistant. It\u2019s a savvy hire, given that Subramanya knows the competition intimately.\nThe move is being characterized as a shake-up. It was seemingly inevitable in retrospect. Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s answer to the ChatGPT moment, has been stumbling since its October 2024 launch. Reviews have ranged from \u201cunderwhelming\u201d to outright alarmed.\nIts first months were some of the roughest. A notification summary feature meant to condense multiple alerts into digestible snippets generated a series of embarrassing, untrue headlines in late 2024 and early 2025. Among other missteps, the BBC complained twice after Apple Intelligence falsely reported that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had shot himself (he hadn\u2019t) and that a darts player, Luke Littler, won a championship before the final even began.\nThen there was Siri\u2019s promised overhaul, which became a black eye for Apple.\nA Bloomberg investigation published in May revealed the depths of Apple\u2019s AI struggles. For instance, when Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s software chief, tested the new Siri on his own phone just weeks before its planned launch in April, he was dismayed to find that many of the features the company had been touting didn\u2019t work. The launch was delayed indefinitely, triggering class-action lawsuits from iPhone 16 buyers who\u2019d been promised an AI-powered assistant.\nBy that point, Giannandrea had already been sidelined, according to Bloomberg. The news organization reported that Tim Cook had stripped Siri from Giannandrea\u2019s oversight entirely back in March, handing it to Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. Apple removed its secretive robotics division from Giannandrea\u2019s control, too.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nBloomberg\u2019s investigation painted a picture of organizational dysfunction, with weak communication between AI and marketing teams, budget misalignments, and a leadership crisis severe enough that some employees had taken to mockingly calling Giannandrea\u2019s group \u201cAI/MLess.\u201d The report also documented an exodus of AI researchers to competitors, including OpenAI, Google, and Meta.\nApple is reportedly now leaning on Google\u2019s Gemini to power the next version of Siri, an astonishing and, presumably, humbling twist considering the intense rivalry between the two companies that dates back more than 15 years, across mobile operating systems, app stores, browsers, maps, cloud services, smart home devices, and now AI.\nGiannandrea came to Apple from Google, where he ran Machine Intelligence and Search. At Apple, he oversaw the AI strategy, machine learning infrastructure, and Siri development.\nNow Subramanya inherits those responsibilities, reporting to Federighi with a clear mandate to help Apple catch up in AI.\nIt\u2019s an interesting moment for the company. While competitors have been pouring billions of dollars into massive AI data centers, Apple has focused on processing AI tasks directly on users\u2019 devices using its custom Apple Silicon chips, a privacy-first approach that avoids collecting user data. (When more complex requests require cloud processing, Apple routes them through Private Cloud Compute, servers that promise to process data temporarily and delete it immediately.)\nWhether that philosophy pays off or whether it has permanently left Apple behind is an outstanding question. Apple\u2019s approach comes with clear trade-offs. Among them, on-device models are smaller and less capable than the massive models running in competitors\u2019 data centers, and Apple\u2019s reluctance to collect user data has left its researchers training models on licensed and synthetic data rather than the giant troves of real-world information that fuel its rivals\u2019 systems.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia\u2019s $2B Synopsys bet tightens its grip on the chip-design stack\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nNvidia is investing $2 billion into Synopsys, which makes software and components for designing semiconductor chips. The deal deepens their existing partnership at a time when analysts have started to scrutinize increasingly common circular AI-industry deals and warn of a potential bubble.\nNvidia said it bought Synopsys shares at $414.79 each as part of a multi-year partnership to integrate Nvidia\u2019s AI hardware and computing capabilities into Synopsys\u2019 electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation software. The deal will help Synopsys transition its platform from CPU-based computing to GPUs, a shift it hopes will speed up chip-design workflows, per a release.\nThe deal gave Synopsys\u2019 stock a lift by signaling long-term growth \u2014 a boon after the company recently reported weakness in its IP segment due to U.S. export restrictions and issues at a major customer.\nFor Nvidia, the investment strengthens its influence over Synopsys\u2019 widely used EDA tools at a time when chip-design competition is starting to heat up. It also comes after major investors such as SoftBank and Peter Thiel have sold off their Nvidia positions.\n\ntitle3:\nData center energy demand forecasted to soar nearly 300% through 2035\ndescription3:\nPlanned data center construction shows no signs of fading, with new additions to require 2.7x \u2014 nearly triple \u2014 the sector\u2019s current demand for electricity over the next decade, according to a new report from BloombergNEF.\nBy 2035, data centers will draw 106 gigawatts, up sharply from the 40 gigawatts they use today. Much of that growth will occur in more rural areas as facilities grow in size and as sites near urban areas become scarce, BloombergNEF said.\nDriving part of the growth is the sheer scale of planned data centers. Today, only 10% of data centers draw more than 50 megawatts of electricity, but over the next decade, the average new facility will draw well over 100 megawatts. The biggest sites help skew the data: Nearly a quarter will be larger than 500 megawatts, and a few will exceed 1 gigawatt.\nPlanned data centers are significantly larger than those currently in operation Image Credits:BloombergNEF\nAt the same time, the utilization rate for all data centers is expected to grow from 59% to 69% as AI training and inference grows to nearly 40% of total data center compute.\nIn some ways, the findings in the new report aren\u2019t surprising. AI companies have been racing to build more powerful data centers, helping to drive global investment in the facilities up to $580 billion this year. That\u2019s more than the world spends finding new supplies of oil.\nStill, the new report shows just how quickly the landscape is changing. It is a sharp revision upwards from a document the group published in April. The upswing was driven by a surge in new projects that have been announced since then. \u201cWith an average seven-year timeline for projects to come online, developments in earlier stages affect the tail end of our forecast the most,\u201d the new report said.\nEarly-stage projects have more than doubled between early 2024 and early 2025, though those are distinct from projects that have been committed or are currently under construction.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

They lie within a region known to industry experts at the PJM Interconnection, a regional transmission organization that\u2019s tasked with operating the electrical grid in those states and others, including Delaware, West Virginia, and parts of Kentucky and North Carolina. Texas\u2019s Ercot grid will see a large number of additions, too.\nThe report arrives as the PJM Interconnection is under scrutiny from its independent monitor, Monitoring Analytics. The group filed a complaint with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) saying that PJM has the authority to authorize new data center connections only when its grid has adequate capacity.\n\u201cAs part of its obligation to maintain reliability, PJM has the authority to require large new data center loads to wait to be added to the system until the loads can be served reliably,\u201d Monitoring Analytics wrote. \u201cPJM has the authority to create a load queue.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, data centers are responsible for today\u2019s high electricity prices within the region, the organization said.\n\u201cPJM\u2019s failure to clarify and enforce its existing rules and to protect reliable and affordable service in PJM is unjust and unreasonable,\u201d it said.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas.

Shopify is one of the most popular e-commerce platforms for millions of businesses to build and manage online stores. The company reports Shopify merchants handle over 10% of all e-commerce transactions in the U.S.\nThe issues began surfacing around 6:45 a.m. PT, when select merchants reported difficulties logging into their Shopify accounts. Additionally, many faced challenges accessing point-of-sale (POS) systems, preventing them from processing transactions.\nShopify\u2019s status page recently confirmed that the company had identified and remedied the cause of the problem: its login authentication flow, which explains the POS login complications. Shopify stated that it\u2019s now seeing signs of recovery and that it will continue monitoring the situation. It also advised merchants that its Help Center was experiencing longer-than-normal wait times for support as a result of today\u2019s outage.\nThe exact number of affected merchants is unclear. However, Downdetector, a website that tracks user-submitted reports about website issues, noted there were about 4,000 outage incidents.\"\n\nResponse:",
