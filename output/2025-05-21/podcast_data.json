As part of the unusual deal announced Wednesday, Ive and his design firm, LoveFrom, will now lead creative and design work at OpenAI.\n\u201cthrilled to be partnering with jony, [in my opinion] the greatest designer in the world,\u201d said Altman in a post on X Wednesday. \u201cexcited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers.\u201d\nthrilled to be partnering with jony, imo the greatest designer in the world.\nexcited to try to create a new generation of AI-powered computers. pic.twitter.com/IPZBNrz1jQ \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) May 21, 2025\nOpenAI and Ive\u2019s collaboration puts one of Apple\u2019s former design heads \u2014 famous for crafting many iPhones, iPods, iPads, and Apple Watches \u2014 at the forefront of the newest technology wave, generative AI. Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI has amped up its consumer business significantly. Earlier this month, the company appointed former Meta executive and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo to lead its consumer applications.\nIve could help OpenAI directly compete with Apple in the consumer hardware space, putting even more pressure on the iPhone maker. In recent years, Apple has struggled to develop AI features that keep up with the latest technology from OpenAI and Google. Apple\u2019s stock fell 2% on Wednesday after the OpenAI and Ive collaboration was announced.\nIo has a staff of around 55 engineers, scientists, researchers, physicists, and product development specialists, per The Wall Street Journal, all of whom will join OpenAI. Many of io\u2019s employees are former Apple designers \u2014 including Scott Cannon, Evans Hankey, and Tang Tan \u2014 who helped build the firm\u2019s most iconic products.\nIve is retaining control of his design firm, LoveFrom, which will continue to operate independently.\nIo, under OpenAI, will develop AI-powered consumer devices and other projects. Altman and Ive have reportedly been working on a device that moves consumers \u201cbeyond screens.\u201d Bloomberg reports that Ive and Altman\u2019s first devices are slated to debut in 2026.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nOpenAI already had a 23% stake in io as part of an agreement between the companies last year, according to The New York Times. That means OpenAI will pay $5 billion to fully acquire io, marking the ChatGPT maker\u2019s largest acquisition ever. Reportedly, the OpenAI Startup Fund made a separate investment in io last year.\nIn a video posted by OpenAI, Altman said the mission of io is to create a family of AI devices that will let people use AI to produce \u201call sorts of wonderful things.\u201d Ive said he\u2019s convinced that everything he\u2019s learned \u201cover the last 30 years has led me to this place and this moment.\u201d The first AI device io is working on has \u201ccompletely captured\u201d Ive\u2019s imagination, he said.\nThe world of AI devices is still in its infancy. Altman was an early investor in Humane, another AI hardware company founded by former Apple employees, which made an AI-powered \u201cpin.\u201d After a series of stumbles, Humane was sold to HP and its devices were sunsetted.\nMeanwhile, other form factors for AI devices have shown more promise. Meta\u2019s AI-powered smart glasses, which it\u2019s developing with the eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, have achieved strong sales and adoption among consumers. This week, Google unveiled its version of AI smart glasses that it\u2019s developing with Samsung, Warby Parker, and other partners.\nUltimately, it\u2019s unclear what shape OpenAI\u2019s devices will take. Later in the video, Altman noted how using a laptop or smartphone to access ChatGPT was too cumbersome. Instead, the OpenAI CEO suggested he\u2019d rather use a device more integrated into his everyday life.\nThe Information first reported on OpenAI\u2019s discussions to acquire io in March. At the time, the two companies were said to be discussing building a device that would bring a version of the technology from the movie \u201cHer\u201d to life.\n\ntitle1:\nSpotify says support for external payments on iOS has already boosted subscriptions\ndescription1:\nSpotify says its ability to direct its customers to external payment links in its iOS app has already had a positive impact on sales. In a newly filed amicus brief in support of Epic Games in its ongoing legal battle with Apple over external payments on the App Store, Spotify claims its internal data indicates that its recent update supporting web payments has resulted in \u201ca significant increase in iOS users upgrading to a Premium subscription.\u201d\nShortly after the U.S. District Court in Northern California ruled in favor of Fortnite maker Epic Games on the matter of external payments, Apple was forced to finally allow U.S. app developers to direct their customers to other ways to pay from within their iOS apps without having to pay Apple\u2019s commission.\nNow, iOS app developers in the U.S. can choose to tell their customers about web billing options and whether there\u2019s a discount for paying directly.\nSpotify was one of the first to update its iOS app to take advantage of the new policy. The updated version explains to customers what subscriptions cost, points them to its website to purchase, and allows users to purchase audiobooks directly.\nThe results have been largely positive, Spotify wrote in the new filing.\n\u201cThe 2025 Order has created substantial benefits for developers and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 consumers,\u201d the filing states. \u201cSpotify\u2019s internal data show that its iOS app updates have already resulted in a significant increase in iOS users upgrading to a Premium subscription. Apple\u2019s compliance has also enabled new product innovations that would not have been possible without the Injunction.\u201d\nSpotify said that its revised \u201cPremium Destination Page\u201d in its iOS app tells free users how to upgrade to a paid subscription by offering information about prices and a link to a checkout page. Since adding the link and pricing information, Spotify says it\u2019s seen the immediate impact of the changes.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nIn the two weeks the new page has been live, Spotify says the rate of conversions from the free to Premium tier has remained \u201crelatively constant\u201d on Android, where Spotify has already been able to offer basic pricing information.\nMeanwhile, the conversion rate among iOS users has increased substantially, the company says.\n\u201cThis strongly suggests that the increase is due to Apple finally complying with the Injunction thanks to the 2025 Order,\u201d Spotify wrote. Plus, the company adds that it\u2019s beginning to see the effects on audiobook purchases just three days after the new product options were launched.\nSpotify declined to share specific numbers related to the increases when reached for comment.\nIts brief joins those from Microsoft and others in support of Epic Games, as Apple tries to fight the injunction that upended its U.S. App Store business.\nApple doesn\u2019t want to comply with the court\u2019s decision, which it\u2019s in the process of appealing, until all legal matters are fully settled.\nIt also tried to keep Epic Games\u2019 Fortnite out of the App Store for the same reason, but the judge pressured Apple to allow the game back in the App Store or return to court to explain why Apple was in non-compliance with the ruling.\nOn Tuesday, Fortnite went live on the U.S. App Store after a five-year hiatus.\nThe case between Apple and Epic now continues in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Apple filed an Emergency Motion so it could revert to its old policy while its appeal was underway. However, the court decided not to grant the motion, saying the panel of judges would follow the default briefing schedule and then rule on the motion in \u201cdue course.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nLuminar secures up to $200M following CEO departure and layoffs\ndescription2:\nLidar company Luminar reached a deal with Yorkville Advisors Global and another unnamed investor that could bring another $200 million into its coffers through the sale of convertible preferred stock over an 18-month period. The agreement, which was announced in a regulatory filing Wednesday, follows an abrupt change in leadership and layoffs.\nEarlier this month, Luminar\u2019s board replaced founder Austin Russell as CEO and board chair. Luminar\u2019s board appointed Paul Ricci to the role. Ricci is the former chairman and CEO of Nuance. The company also launched another round of layoffs \u2014 its third since spring 2024.\nUnder the terms, Luminar will issue $35 million in convertible preferred stock to the investors. Luminar may issue additional tranches in amounts of up $35 million no more than every 60 days at a purchase price equal to 96% of the stated value of the convertible preferred stock. However, Luminar isn\u2019t under any obligation to issue additional stock.\n\u201cToday\u2019s transaction provides us with additional financial flexibility and further strengthens our balance sheet,\u201d Luminar CFO Tom Fennimore said in a statement \u201cWe\u2019ve made substantial progress in extending our liquidity runway with our restructuring efforts, and the additional capital available to us under this facility provides us with another tool to realize our long-term value.\u201d\nThe company said proceeds from the initial $35 million issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes and debt retirement.\nYorkville has offered these lifelines to other struggling publicly traded companies, a list that includes failed Lordstown Motors, Faraday Future, and the now bankrupt Canoo.\nLuminar was founded by Russell in 2012 when he was just a teenager. Luminar, and Russell, became Silicon Valley darlings when the lidar startup broke cover in April 2017 after operating for years in secrecy and at the height of the autonomous vehicle technology hype cycle.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Today, Luminar has a market cap of $179 million. Luminar raised $250 million prior to the SPAC announcement.\nLuminar has had some wins, but also restructured several times. Luminar cut about 30% of its workforce in 2024 via two rounds of layoffs. Some of those layoffs spilled into the first quarter of 2025. A total of 212 employees were laid off.\nIn a regulatory filing earlier this month, the company said it began additional layoffs May 15. These new layoffs are expected to cost $4 million to $5 million in cash charges. These costs are expected to be incurred in the second and third quarters of this year.\n\ntitle3:\nLM Arena, the organization behind popular AI leaderboards, lands $100M\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nLM Arena, a crowdsourced benchmarking project that major AI labs rely on to test and market their AI models, has raised $100 million in a seed funding round that values the organization at $600 million, according to Bloomberg.\nAndreessen Horowitz (a16z) and UC Investments, which manages an investment portfolio for the University of California, led the fundraising.
