Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday September 25), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nSalesforce snatches up Zoomin, a tool for organizing company knowledge\ndescription0:\nSalesforce is on a buying spree.\nAfter snatching up data management firm Own earlier in the month, Salesforce today announced its plans to buy Zoomin, an enterprise knowledge platform. Zoomin \u2014 which we\u2019ve covered a handful of times before \u2014 unifies a company\u2019s docs, like product user guides and tutorials, in one portal.\nThe terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Salesforce expects it to be finalized in Q4 of its fiscal year 2025 (January 31), subject to customary closing conditions.\nFounded in 2019 by Gal Oron, Hannan Saltzman, and Joe Gelb, Zoomin applies AI and big data to help companies build self-service documentation search and support experiences. The Israeli startup\u2019s customers range from tech brands like McAfee and Dell to fast-food franchises including Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes.\nZoomin\u2019s investors \u2014 among them General Atlantic, Bessemer Ventures Partners, Viola Growth, and Salesforce\u2019s own venture org, Salesforce Ventures \u2014 poured $73 million in capital into the firm.\nRahul Auradkar, EVP of unified data sources at Salesforce, says that post-acquisition, Zoomin will augment Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud platform to power use cases like using a company\u2019s knowledge base to automate customer service interactions.\n\u201cProprietary unstructured data is powerful fuel our customers can use for AI agents and customer experiences,\u201d Auradkar said, \u201cand Zoomin\u2019s proven expertise and technology will accelerate Data Cloud\u2019s innovation and enable our customers to get better value.\u201d\nSalesforce\u2019s acquisition of Zoomin comes after the tech giant pledged to spend $500 million in additional cash on AI startups through Salesforce Ventures.\n\ntitle1:\nByteDance is shutting down TikTok Music globally\ndescription1:\nByteDance said it is shuttering its music streaming service, TikTok Music, in November.\n\u201cWe are sorry to inform you that TikTok Music will be closing on 28 November 2024,\u201d a notice on TikTok Music\u2019s website reads. The service was available in Indonesia, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, and Mexico.\nSubscribers can continue to use the service until November 28, after which renewals will be automatically canceled, the notice said. Users who want to transfer their playlists to other streaming services will need to do so by October 28, and refund requests need to be submitted by November 28.\n\u201cOur Add to Music App feature has already enabled hundreds of millions of track saves to playlists on partner music streaming services. We will be closing TikTok Music at the end of November in order to focus on our goal of furthering TikTok\u2019s role in driving even greater music listening and value on music streaming services, for the benefit of artists, songwriters, and the industry,\u201d Ole Obermann, global head of Music Business Development, TikTok, said in a statement.\nTikTok said that it will continue partnering with music streaming services rather than competing with them. In February, the company launched the \u201cAdd to Music\u201d feature on TikTok that lets users add tracks directly to a playlist on Apple Music, Amazon Music, or Spotify.\nTikTok Music was rooted in a ByteDance product called Resso, which was first launched in India and Indonesia in 2019 and later expanded to Brazil.\nIn 2023, ByteDance rebranded Resso to TikTok Music in Brazil and Indonesia, and soon after expanded it to Singapore, Australia, and Mexico. Resso was banned early this year in India.\nTikTok has become a popular way for people to discover music and serves as a launchpad for artists, driving their streams. TikTok has a significant impact on increasing value for artists via streaming and fueling music discovery, per a study conducted by TikTok and entertainment data research firm Lumiate.\nByteDance, which also owns a music distribution platform called SoundOn, likely wanted to bank on TikTok\u2019s popularity to drive streams within its own ecosystem, but the service didn\u2019t expand internationally beyond a few markets.\nTikTok also has had a shaky relationship with the music industry lately. Earlier this year, Universal Music Group (UMG) pulled its music catalog out of the service after disagreements over royalties. In response, TikTok called out UMG for \u201cfalse narrative and rhetoric.\u201d In March, both parties called a truce and signed a new deal.\nSeparately, TikTok is fighting a case against a bill that would possibly lead to the short video app being banned in the U.S. This might have hampered ByteDance\u2019s plans of expanding TikTok Music to markets like the U.S.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI rolls out Advanced Voice Mode with more voices and a new look\ndescription2:\nOpenAI announced it is rolling out Advanced Voice Mode (AVM) to an expanded set of ChatGPT\u2019s paying customers on Tuesday. The audio feature, which makes ChatGPT more natural to speak with, will initially roll out to customers in ChatGPT\u2019s Plus and Teams tiers. Enterprise and Edu customers will start receiving access next week.\nAs part of the rollout, AVM is getting a revamped design. The feature is now represented by a blue animated sphere, instead of the animated black dots that OpenAI presented during its showcase of the technology in May.\nUsers will receive a pop-up in the ChatGPT app, next to the voice icon, when AVM has been made available to them.\nAdvanced Voice is rolling out to all Plus and Team users in the ChatGPT app over the course of the week. While you\u2019ve been patiently waiting, we\u2019ve added Custom Instructions, Memory, five new voices, and improved accents. It can also say \u201cSorry I\u2019m late\u201d in over 50 languages. pic.twitter.com/APOqqhXtDg \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 24, 2024\nChatGPT is also getting five new voices that users can try out: Arbor, Maple, Sol, Spruce, and Vale. This brings ChatGPT\u2019s total number of voices to nine (almost as many as Google\u2019s Gemini Live), alongside Breeze, Juniper, Cove, and Ember. You might notice all of these names are inspired by nature, which could be because the whole point of AVM is to make using ChatGPT feel more natural.\nOne voice missing from this lineup is Sky, the voice OpenAI showcased during its spring update, which led to a legal threat from Scarlett Johansson. The actress, who played an AI system in the feature film \u201cHer,\u201d claimed that Sky\u2019s voice sounded a little too similar to her own. OpenAI promptly took Sky\u2019s voice down, saying it never intended to resemble Johansson\u2019s voice, despite several staff members making references to the movie in tweets at the time.\nAnother feature missing from this rollout: ChatGPT\u2019s video and screen sharing that OpenAI debuted during its spring update four months ago. That feature is supposed to let GPT-4o simultaneously process visual and audible information. During the demo, an OpenAI staff member showed how you could ask ChatGPT real-time questions about math on a piece of paper in front of you, or code on your computer screen. At this time, OpenAI is not offering a timeline for when it will launch these multimodal capabilities.\nThat said, OpenAI says it has made some improvements since releasing its limited alpha test of AVM. ChatGPT\u2019s voice feature is allegedly better at understanding accents now, and the company says its conversations are smoother and faster as well. During our tests with AVM, we found that glitches were not uncommon, but the company claims that\u2019s now improved.\nOpenAI is also expanding some of ChatGPT\u2019s customization features to AVM: Custom Instructions, which allows users to personalize how ChatGPT responds to them, and Memory, which allows ChatGPT to remember conversations to reference later on.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson says AVM is not yet available in several regions, including the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein.\n\ntitle3:\nBlackstone and Vista Equity Partners to acquire software maker Smartsheet\ndescription3:\nCollaboration software maker Smartsheet on Tuesday announced Blackstone and Vista Equity Partners will acquire it in an all-cash deal valuing the company at about $8.4 billion.\nStockholders will receive $56.50 per share, a 41% premium to Smartsheet's average closing price over the last three months.\nThe company had been gauging interest from potential acquirers for several months. Smartsheet went public in 2018 and sought to go head-to-head with other software companies like Atlassian.\n\"As we look to the future, we are confident that Blackstone and Vista's expertise and resources will help us ensure Smartsheet remains a great place to work where our employees thrive,\" CEO Mark Mader said in a release. Smartsheet shares rose 6% on the news.\nThe transaction has a 45-day go-shop period, allowing Smartsheet to solicit other bidders. Barring another offer, the deal is expected to close by January 2025, pending shareholder approval.\nQatalyst advised Smartsheet. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley advised the private equity bidders.\n\ntitle4:\nCaroline Ellison sentenced to two years in prison for FTX fraud\ndescription4:\nCaroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX affiliate Alameda Research, was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday.\nEllison pled guilty to conspiring with FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried to steal $8 billion worth of customers\u2019 funds, but she was an exceedingly cooperative witness, helping law enforcement to investigate the massive fraud scheme. Her two-year sentence stands in stark contrast to Bankman-Fried\u2019s 25-year sentence.\nThough he is currently in prison, Bankman-Fried has continued to appeal his sentence. Unlike Ellison, the former FTX founder pled not guilty. Two other former FTX executives, Gary Wang and Nishad Singh, await sentencing.\"\n\nResponse:",
