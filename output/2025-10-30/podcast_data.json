Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

If the SEC later finds material deficiencies or undisclosed issues, the company may be forced to amend its statements, which could lead to a lower stock price and even potential litigation.\nDespite this risk, Navan decided to proceed with its IPO, primarily because the bulk of its registration statements had already been reviewed by the SEC staff before the government shutdown began on October 1.\nThe stock\u2019s initial decline is likely influenced, at least in part, by this regulatory uncertainty.\nThe market\u2019s reaction to Navan\u2019s offering is being closely monitored by other IPO contenders. Startups looking to go public before the end of the year need to decide soon whether they\u2019re ready to deal with the regulatory unknowns or delay their filing until the next year.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

The company reportedly filed its confidential IPO paperwork in 2022 and planned to debut at a $12 billion valuation in early 2023.\nThe company, formerly known as TripActions, was last valued at $9.2 billion when it raised a $154 million Series G round in October 2022.\nNavan customers include Shopify, Zoom, Wayfair, OpenAI, and Thomson Reuters. The company claims that its AI-powered assistant, Ava, handles approximately 50% of customer conversations related to booking or changing flight, hotel, and car rental reservations. Navan\u2019s expense management solution helps companies manage employee expenses through features like automated receipt scanning and categorization.\nThe company generated revenue of $613 million over the last 12 months (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to its S1.\nNavan\u2019s largest venture capital backers before its IPO included Lightspeed (holding a 24.8% stake), solo VC Oren Zeev (18.6% stake), Andreessen Horowitz (12.6%), and Greenoaks (7.1%).\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle partners with Ambani's Reliance to offer free AI Pro access to millions of Jio users in India\ndescription2:\nIn a push to expand its AI footprint in emerging markets, Google has partnered with billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2013led Reliance Industries to bundle its AI Pro subscription with Jio 5G plans at no extra cost.\nOn Thursday, Google announced a partnership with Reliance, India\u2019s largest company by market capitalization, to offer its AI Pro subscription free for 18 months to eligible Jio users. The alliance comes just three months after Perplexity teamed up with Reliance\u2019s archrival Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s second-largest telecom operator, to provide free access to Perplexity Pro for Airtel\u2019s 360 million subscribers.\nIndia, the world\u2019s most populous nation and the second-largest internet market with over a billion users, has long been an irresistible target for global tech firms. While the country has not yet seen a major homegrown AI breakthrough, U.S. tech giants increasingly view it as the next big frontier \u2014 a place to gather diverse data, refine models, and test AI use cases that could later scale across other emerging markets. The latest partnership between Google and Reliance is a clear reflection of that strategy.\nThe Jio offer will initially reach users aged 18 to 25 before expanding to all Jio subscribers nationwide, the companies said. It includes access to Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro model via the Gemini app, higher limits for generating AI images and videos with Nano Banana and Veo 3.1, expanded use of Notebook LM for study and research, and 2 TB of cloud storage across Google Photos, Gmail, Drive, and WhatsApp backups.\n\u201cThis partnership will also explore bringing more delightful local experiences powered by AI to Jio users,\u201d the Indian telecom giant said.\nThe 18-month offer is valued at \u20b935,100 (about $396), the companies said. Google\u2019s AI Pro plan normally costs \u20b91,950 (around $22) per month in India and includes a free one-month trial.\nBeyond the consumer offer, Reliance also partnered with Google Cloud to broaden access to its tensor processing units (TPUs) in India. Reliance\u2019s AI subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence, will become a strategic go-to-market partner for Google Cloud to expand Gemini Enterprise across Indian organizations and will develop its own prebuilt AI agents for the platform.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement will put Google\u2019s cutting-edge AI tools in the hands of consumers, businesses, and India\u2019s vibrant developer community,\u201d Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet, said in a prepared statement.\nAt its 48th annual general meeting in late August, Reliance announced partnerships with its investors Google and Meta to strengthen its AI infrastructure in India through a newly created subsidiary, Reliance Intelligence. Reliance and Meta also committed to setting up a joint venture with a combined investment of \u20b98.55 billion (approximately $100 million), with a 70/30 ownership split.\nEarlier this week, Google rival OpenAI announced plans to offer free access to its sub-$5 ChatGPT Go plan to all users in India starting November 4. The entry-level tier, launched locally in August, has since expanded to 17 countries across Asia.\nAI heavyweights like OpenAI and Anthropic are also setting up shop in India, hoping to learn more about local users and grow their reach in the world\u2019s biggest emerging market.\nEarlier this year, Google offered Indian students a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan. That promotion ran until September 15.\nIndia has already helped drive adoption of U.S.-led AI platforms and ranks among the top consumer markets for tools such as Google\u2019s Nano Banana, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. Extending free access to paid AI versions could further accelerate adoption and cement India\u2019s position as a key growth consumer market for generative AI offerings. However, it remains to be seen how India will translate into meaningful revenue for these AI companies once the current wave of free bundling offers runs its course.\n\u201cThrough our collaboration with strategic and long-term partners like Google, we aim to make India not just AI-enabled but AI-empowered \u2014 where every citizen and enterprise can harness intelligent tools to create, innovate, and grow,\u201d Ambani said.\n\ntitle3:\nFigma acquires AI-powered media generation company Weavy\ndescription3:\nDesign platform Figma said today that it has acquired AI-powered image and video generation company Weavy. The startup will join Figma under a new brand called Figma Weave.\nFigma said that 20 people from Weavy will join the company but didn\u2019t disclose the valuation of the deal. The Tel Aviv-based startup was founded in 2024 and raised $4 million in a seed round in June led by Entr\u00e9e Capital, with participation from Designer Fund, Founder Collective, and Fiverr founder Micha Kaufman.\nFigma said that Weavy will exist as a stand-alone product for now and that, in the future, it will be integrated with the Figma Weave brand, along with the rest of the Figma platform.\nWeavy\u2019s web tools enable users to combine different AI models and offer users pro editing tools to create high-quality images and videos for use in product mock-ups or brand styling. Users can edit these media generations with layer edits, adjust lighting, and change colors and angles through prompts to achieve the final result they want.\nImage Credits:Figma\nUsers start with an element like a prompt for an image generation on an infinite canvas, look at results from different models, pick one image, add another prompt for video generation, and look at different results produced by various models. At any point, users can use the edit tools to change the look of a video. Designers can also combine multiple prompts and models to get to the output they want.\nThe startup offers different models such as Seedance, Sora, and Veo for video, and Flux, Ideogram, Nano Banana, and Seedream for image generation.\nImage Credits:Figma\n\u201cThis node-based approach brings a new level of craft and control to AI generation. Outputs can be branched, remixed, and refined, combining creative exploration with iteration and craft. The Weavy team has inspired us with the balance they\u2019ve struck between simplicity, approachability, and power. They\u2019ve also created a tool that\u2019s just a joy to use,\u201d Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a statement.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAI-powered design platforms are in demand to create media generation and design workflow capabilities. Earlier this month, AI search platform Perplexity acquired the team behind the Sequoia-backed design platform Visual Electric. In April, Krea announced that it had raised $83 million across various rounds from firms like Bain Capital, a16z, and Abstract Ventures.\n\ntitle4:\nCanva launches its own design model, adds new AI features to the platform\ndescription4:\nCreative suite company Canva launched its own design model on Thursday that understands design layers and formats to power its features. The company also introduced new products and features, updates to its AI assistant, and the ability to use its spreadsheet tool alongside its app-building feature to create data visualization widgets.\nCanva said that it is launching its own foundational model, trained on its design elements, that generates designs with editable layers and objects rather than flat images. The model works across different formats, including social media posts, presentations, whiteboards, and websites.\n\u201cWe started by creating flat images with diffusion models. Omni models have taken that a step further, where you\u2019re able to edit those flat images with a lot of sophistication through prompting. But the tools have made you prompt your way to the final result, which, for a visual medium, is challenging,\u201d Canva\u2019s global head of product, Robert Kawalsky, told TechCrunch over a call.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that people . . . want the ability to start with a prompt and get far, but also be able to iterate directly themselves.\u201d\nEarlier this year, the company unveiled an AI assistant called Canva AI that has a chat-like interface for generating visual content from text prompts. The platform is now making that assistant available throughout the interface, including the design and elements tabs.\nUsers can also tag (@mention) the bot in comments to get text or media suggestions while working on a project with others. Plus, the AI tool can now generate 3D objects and allows users to copy the art style of any design.\nThe company also added a spreadsheet product and a feature that lets users create mini apps through prompts. Now it\u2019s connecting these two products, allowing users to use data stored in the spreadsheet and create widgets from that.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nCanva also acquired an ad analytics company called MagicBrief earlier this year. Using its own platform for creation along with the new measurement tool, Canva is launching Canva Grow, an all-in-one marketing platform that uses AI for both asset creation and performance analytics. It also allows marketers to publish their ads directly on platforms like Meta.\nAlong with AI features, the Australian design company announced several new products and features for its platform. Users can now create forms with Canva to collect responses from their clients or audiences as an alternative to services like Google Forms.\nThe company is also adding email design to the platform for users to create templates and layouts for marketing or transactional emails that follow their brand\u2019s aesthetics.\nCanva acquired the professional design suite Affinity last year to better compete with Adobe. With this release, the company said that it is making Affinity free forever for users.\nCanva is also redesigning the Affinity interface to merge vector, pixel, and layout tools under one interface. It\u2019s tightly integrating Affinity with Canva so designers can create objects in the professional tool and move them into Canva. Users can also take advantage of Canva AI to generate images or designs within Affinity, the company said.\"\n\nResponse:",
