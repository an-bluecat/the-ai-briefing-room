Usage is still growing at a rapid pace as the AI developer behind the AI chatbot, ChatGPT, \u201conly\u201d had 300 million users in December 2024. Though OpenAI has not revealed the number of paid customers with an active subscription to ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Pro.\nOn the B2B front, ChatGPT\u2019s enterprise plans are growing nicely: OpenAI now has 2 million paying enterprise users \u2014 with the usage figure doubling since September 2024. As for OpenAI\u2019s developer APIs, the company said that its developer traffic has doubled in the past six months.\nIt\u2019s interesting to note that OpenAI shared these metrics just a few weeks after China\u2019s DeepSeek released rival tech: an AI model, a reasoning model, and an AI assistant app. OpenAI is keen to demonstrate that its business is thriving \u2014 thank you for asking.\n\ntitle1:\nRivian inches closer to profitability but warns 'changes to government policies' could hurt\ndescription1:\nRivian\u2019s cost-cutting measures have gotten it a lot closer to profitability, but the company is warning that 2025 could still be a challenging year \u2014 especially because of the whorl of uncertainty caused by the new Trump administration.\nThe company announced Thursday its fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, and along with it, shared plans to deliver between 46,000 and 51,000 EVs across 2025. Rivian cautioned that \u201cchanges to government policies and regulations, and a challenging demand environment\u201d could affect those results, according to the shareholder letter the EV maker released alongside its results.\nRivian didn\u2019t specify what those changes might be, but Trump said on the campaign trail that he was inclined to find a way to kill the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. Friend of the Trump administration Vivek Ramaswamy has also called for the clawback of a $6.6 billion loan from the Department of Energy to build a plant in Georgia. That loan was finalized three days before Trump took office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really looking forward to working with the new administration and Department of Energy on our loan, and we share in the President\u2019s desire to bring jobs back to the US,\u201d Rivian\u2019s chief financial officer Claire McDonough said on a conference call Thursday, noting that the company plans to create 7,500 manufacturing jobs at the planned Georgia plant. She said later in the call that Rivian is planning to take a hit as big as \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars related to tariffs, any loss of EV credits, and other policy changes.\n\u201cWe really believe, and we\u2019re very aligned with the administration on this, that the U.S. needs to continue to be a world leader in this regard, and our investment into electronics, into software, into autonomy and AI \u2014 these are really key areas for us as a country to continue to exercise a leadership position in,\u201d CEO RJ Scaringe said on the call.\nRivian\u2019s cost-cutting tear\nRivian spent much of 2024 on a cost-cutting tear. It laid off 10% of its workforce in February, and rolled out simplified, cheaper-to-make versions of its flagship EVs \u2014 the R1T pickup and the R1S SUV \u2014 in June. The company ended up changing 600 parts on those vehicles to drive down manufacturing costs, while also revamping its electric architecture and software user interface.\nChanges like those helped Rivian notch $170 million of positive gross profit in the final quarter of 2024 \u2013 though $60 million of that came from software and services.\nRivian reported $1.7 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, a 32% increase from the same period in 2023. The bulk of its Q4 revenue \u2014 about $1.5 billion \u2014 came from the sale of 14,183 vehicles as well as $299 million from the sale of zero-emissions regulatory credits to automakers. For the year, Rivian reported $325 million in revenues from the sale of regulatory credits.\nRevenue from software is increasingly playing an important role. Rivian generated $214 million from software and services in the fourth quarter, double the amount from the same-year ago period. Rivian reported $484 million in revenue for 2024 from software and services.\nRivian may be in the business of building and selling EVs, but its future is also largely pinned to software, namely through a lucrative joint venture with Volkswagen Group.\nRevenue from software was primarily driven by charging and subscriptions fees, repair and maintenance services, and new vehicle electrical architecture and software development services provided by the joint venture, according to Rivian.\nGen AI comes to Rivian\nThe company has turned to generative AI as one tool to streamline customer service and reduce costs. The idea is to use AI to automate processes and \u201cgreatly reduce administrative overhead on all non-repair tasks,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter.\nWhat that looks like in practice is an AI assistant, or chatbot, integrated into the Rivian app. The company rolled out a beta version in the Rivian mobile app for R1 customers this past December.\nThe AI assistant was built using a combination of in-house AI agent infrastructure and a third-party large language models, according to a Rivian spokesperson, who added the company has guardrails in place to limit the conversation to Rivian service and guide-related questions.\nThe AI assistant was designed to answer questions about service needs and general questions about the vehicle. A company spokesperson said it can also do basic troubleshooting, collect necessary information for service, and answer general questions about the vehicle.\nThis story has been updated with information from Rivian\u2019s quarterly earnings call.\n\ntitle2:\n6 new tech unicorns were minted in January 2025\ndescription2:\nDespite a still tight venture capital market, new unicorns are still being created every month.\nUsing data from Crunchbase and PitchBook, TechCrunch tracked down the newly VC-backed startup minted unicorns so far this year (as of the end of January). These include healthcare companies like Hippocratic AI and satellite space companies like Loft Orbital.\nThis list will be updated throughout the year, so check back and see the powerhouses raising this year!\nJanuary\nKikoff \u2014 $1 billion: This personal finance platform last raised an undisclosed amount that valued it at $1 billion, according to PitchBook. The company, founded in 2019, has raised $42.5 million to date and counts Female Founders Fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and basketballer Steph Curry as investors.\nNetradyne \u2014 $1.35 billion: Founded in 2015, this computer vision startup raised a $90 million Series D valuing it at $1.35 billion, according to Crunchbase. The round was led by Point72 Ventures.\nHippocratic AI \u2014 $1.6 billion: This startup, founded in 2023, creates healthcare models. It raised a $141 million Series B, valuing it at $1.64 billion, according to Crunchbase. The round was led by Kleiner Perkins.\nTruveta \u2014 $1 billion: This genetic research company raised a $320 million round valuing it at $1 billion, according to Crunchbase. Founded in 2020, its investors include the CVCs from Microsoft and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.\nMercor \u2014 $2 billion: This contract recruiting startup raised a $100 million Series B valuing it at $2 billion. The company, founded in 2022, counts Felicis, Menlo Ventures, Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, and Anthology Fund as investors.\nLoft Orbital \u2014 $1 billion: Founded in 2017, the satellite company raised a $170 million Series C valuing the company at $1 billion, according to Crunchbase. Investors in the round included Temasek and Tikehau Capital.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon is shutting down its app store on Android\ndescription3:\nAmazon will discontinue its app store for Android on August 20 this year. The company sent a notice to developers indicating that they will no longer be able to submit new apps to the store.\nThe company said on a support page that it will also discontinue its Coins digital currency, which could be used to purchase games and apps on the app store.\n\u201cStarting August 20, 2025, you will no longer have access to the Amazon Appstore on your Android device. We will also be discontinuing the Amazon Coins program on August 20, 2025,\u201d the company said on a support page.\nAmazon said that it will refund any coins that users hold as of August 20. The company added that only a small number of customers used the app store outside Amazon devices.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to discontinue the Amazon Appstore on Android to focus our efforts on the Appstore experience on our own devices, as that\u2019s where the overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\nThe company added that the app store will still be functional on its own devices, such as Fire TV and Fire Tablet.\nLast year, security researchers at McAfee Labs found that an application on the Amazon app store was masquerading as a health tool to spread malware.\nAmazon has tried to compete with Google and create an alternative app store ecosystem since 2011. The company also tried to power its failed Fire Phone project through its own app store.\nAmazon last year said it will discontinue support for its app store on Windows, which offered Android apps, starting March 5, 2025. The company started the program for Windows in 2021.\nThe story has been updated with Amazon\u2019s comments.\n\ntitle4:\nMercor, an AI recruiting startup founded by 21-year-olds, raises $100M at $2B valuation\ndescription4:\nMercor, the AI recruiting startup founded by three 21-year-old Thiel Fellows, has raised $100 million in a Series B round, the company confirmed to TechCrunch.\nMenlo Park-based Felicis led the round, valuing Mercor at $2 billion \u2014 eight times its previous valuation, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Existing investors Benchmark and General Catalyst, as well as DST Global and Menlo Ventures participated.\nGeneral Catalyst led the company\u2019s $3.6 million seed round in 2023, while Benchmark backed its $32 million Series A in 2024 at a $250 million valuation.\nThe round makes CEO Brendan Foody, CTO Adarsh Hiremath, and COO Surya Midha, some of the youngest founders of a billion-dollar startup. The two-year-old platform, which counts Peter Thiel, Jack Dorsey, and Adam D\u2019Angelo as backers, says the latest funding will help \u201caccelerate its ability to match billions of people with their calling, applying human talent to its highest potential.\u201d\nFounded in 2023, Mercor uses AI to streamline hiring. Its platform automates resume screening and candidate matching, and offers AI-powered interviews and payroll management. Employers upload job descriptions and Mercor\u2019s system recommends the best candidates.\nMercor claims its automated system not only streamlines hiring but also removes bias from the process. That claim alleges that AI systems are less biased than humans, which hasn\u2019t always proved to be true. Nevertheless, tech companies such as OpenAI are already using Mercor\u2019s automated tools, which the company claims can find better human candidates than, well, other humans.\nJob seekers complete a 20-minute AI interview that evaluates their skills and creates a profile. The platform then matches them with relevant full-time, part-time, or hourly roles.\n\u201cWe collect performance data on candidates and use it to refine our predictions on who will perform best in the future,\u201d Foody said.\nMercor initially focused on hiring software engineers and tech professionals in operations, content creation, product development, and design. Software engineers are still the most in-demand talent on Mercor today, Foody said. But AI labs are increasingly seeking other professionals \u2014 consultants, PhDs, bankers, doctors, and lawyers.\nTo meet rising demand, Mercor has expanded its talent pool, helping HR teams evaluate 468,000 applicants. India remains its largest talent source, followed by the U.S., while Europe and South America are seeing rapid growth.\nRevenue skyrockets as companies embrace flexible work\nThis momentum has driven a sharp increase in Mercor\u2019s revenue, which it generates by charging hourly finders\u2019 fees to its clients.\nLast September, the startup was growing 50% month-over-month, with an annual revenue run rate (calculated by multiplying its latest monthly revenue by 12) in the \u201ctens of millions.\u201d Maintaining that pace, it now stands at a $75 million ARR, most of which comes from AI labs. Mercor says it now works with the world\u2019s top five AI labs, including OpenAI.\nMercor\u2019s $2 billion valuation gives it a 27x ARR multiple, a reasonable figure compared to the more inflated valuations seen today. Some investors are willing to pay up to 50 times ARR for the fastest-growing generative AI companies.\nAside from concerns about hiring bias, another debate surrounding Mercor\u2019s technology is its potential to accelerate job displacement as AI advances.\nFoody, however, argues that rather than displacing workers, Mercor is automating large parts of the economy, making workers even more valuable in the areas where they are still needed.\nAccording to the chief executive, Mercor helps identify jobs humans should be doing in an AI-driven economy or jobs AI can\u2019t perform \u2014 such as training AI models, managing complex decisions, or filling creative and strategic roles.\n\u201cIf AI automates 90% of the economy, then humans become the bottleneck for the remaining 10%. So there\u2019s 10x leverage on every unit of economic output that humans contribute because the rest has been automated,\u201d Foody explains. \u201cThat means the way people work is changing as we move toward a more fractional, gig-like work model.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why the founder believes Mercor will remain relevant in the long run, as more companies prioritize expertise over tenure and hire specialists for short-term projects instead of relying on full-time staff.\n\u201cI think work becomes more efficient through smarter job matching,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery project should be handled by the best person for the job, not just whoever is available on staff.\u201d\nAs for its own hiring, Mercor, with an average team age of 22, recently hired the former head of Human Data Operations at OpenAI and the previous head of Growth at Scale.\"\n\nResponse:",
