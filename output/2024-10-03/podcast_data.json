Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Thrive planned to invest $1 billion in the round, CNBC previously reported.\nOpenAI's rapid ascent, which began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has been the biggest story in the tech industry over the last couple years, bringing the concept of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and paving the way for tens of billions of dollars of investments in AI infrastructure.\n\"The new funding will allow us to double down on our leadership in frontier AI research, increase compute capacity, and continue building tools that help people solve hard problems,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog post Wednesday.\n\"We look forward to continuing our partnership with OpenAI,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.\nOpenAI generated $300 million in revenue last month, up 1,700% since the beginning of last year, CNBC confirmed last week, following reporting by The New York Times. The company expects to bring in $11.6 billion in sales next year, up from $3.7 billion in 2024, according to a person close to OpenAI who asked not to be named because the financials are confidential.\nBut all that revenue is extremely costly, as OpenAI has to ramp up purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and run its large language models. The company expects to lose about $5 billion this year, the person said. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a key partner as the software giant bolsters its Azure cloud business.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI was valued at a reported $80 billion, up from $29 billion in 2023. Following the viral growth of ChatGPT, momentum has continued with new products for businesses and an expansion into AI-generated photos and videos.\nOpenAI now has 250 million weekly active users on ChatGPT, CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC in a statement. There are also 11 million ChatGPT Plus subscribers and 1 million paying business users on ChatGPT, a person close to the company said.\n\"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating healthcare breakthroughs, and driving productivity,\" Friar said in the statement. \"And this is just the start.\"\nOpenAI is experiencing plenty of growing pains along the way, including the loss of key executives, a trend that continued through last week.\nLast Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, who briefly served as interim CEO, said she would be leaving after 6\u00bd years. Shortly after that, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, said they were leaving the company.\nIn an interview the next day at Italian Tech Week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, \"I think this will be hopefully a great transition for everyone involved and I hope OpenAI will be stronger for it, as we are for all of our transitions.\"\nAlso on Thursday, OpenAI held an all-hands meeting, following the board's decision to consider restructuring the company to a for-profit business, according to a separate person with knowledge of the matter. Altman said the departures were not related to the potential restructuring, contrary to some media reports.\nShould the change occur, the nonprofit segment would remain as a separate entity, the source said.\nAt Thursday's meeting, Altman denied reports of plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling that information \"just not true,\" according to a person who was in attendance.\nOpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor told CNBC in a statement last week that while the board has talked about the matter, no specific figures are on the table.\n\"The board has had discussions about whether it would be beneficial to the company and our mission to have Sam be compensated with equity, but no specific figures have been discussed nor have any decisions been made,\" Taylor said.\nThe latest funding round also included participation from Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Fidelity, MGX and Tiger Global, sources told CNBC.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI gets $4 billion revolving credit line on top of latest funding\ndescription1:\n\"This means we now have access to over $10 billion in liquidity, which gives us the flexibility to invest in new initiatives and operate with full agility as we scale,\" OpenAI wrote in a Thursday blog post, adding that the company plans to use the money to invest in research and products, expand infrastructure, and attract talent. \"It also reaffirms our partnership with an exceptional group of financial institutions, many of whom are also OpenAI customers.\"\nThe base credit line is $4 billion, with an option to increase it by an additional $2 billion. The loan is unsecured and can be tapped over the course of three years. OpenAI's interest rate is equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 100 basis points. SOFR, a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, sat at just over 5% as of early this week, meaning OpenAI would be paying roughly 6% on money that it borrows right away.\nOpenAI has a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion, CNBC has learned. It follows news Wednesday that OpenAI closed its recent funding round at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies.\nIn this photo illustration, the OpenAI logo is displayed on a mobile phone screen with a photo of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.\nOpenAI's latest funding round included an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies. Led by Thrive Capital, which planned to invest $1 billion, investors included existing backer Microsoft as well as chipmaker Nvidia. SoftBank, Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Fidelity Management & Research Co., MGX and Tiger Global also participated, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nOpenAI's rapid ascent, which began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has been the biggest story in the tech industry over the last couple of years, bringing the concept of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and paving the way for tens of billions of dollars of investments in AI infrastructure.

The company expects to lose about $5 billion this year, the person said. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a key partner as the software giant bolsters its Azure cloud business.\nIn an on-air appearance Thursday, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said of the restructuring rumors, \"We have discussed this, that we are looking into how we restructure from here.\"\nLater, Friar added, \"We just want to be kind of a more traditional company. Why make things complicated that don't need to be complicated? We need to make sure we can continue to get investments so that we are a sustainable, long-term participant in this ecosystem, and we want to make sure it's a company that works for all of our stakeholders.\"\nOpenAI has also experienced plenty of growing pains in recent months, including the loss of key executives, a trend that continued through last week with the departures of CTO Mira Murati, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, research vice president.\nOpenAI held an all-hands meeting last Thursday following the board's decision to consider restructuring the company to a for-profit business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who said that should the change occur, the nonprofit segment would remain as a separate entity.\nAt that meeting, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman denied reports of plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling that information \"just not true,\" according to the person, who was in attendance.\nOpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor told CNBC in a statement last week that while the board has talked about the matter, no specific figures are on the table.\n\"The board has had discussions about whether it would be beneficial to the company and our mission to have Sam be compensated with equity, but no specific figures have been discussed nor have any decisions been made,\" Taylor said.\nWhen asked about whether the company will eventually go public, Friar told CNBC Thursday in the same on-air appearance that the company has \"really big aspirations of, 'How do we keep investing and what drives this technology?' It's compute first, and it's not cheap. It's great talent second, and then, of course, it's all the normal operating expenses of a more traditional company.\"\nFriar added, \"To that end, we do want to get make sure we're being creative in where we can go to tap capital. To your point, sometimes that's public markets, sometimes that's debt markets, sometimes it's project finance, structured finance. There's a lot of things that I need to get my kind of fingers into as I look forward over the next several quarters.\"\n\ntitle2:\nA co-lead on Sora, OpenAI's video generator, has left for Google\ndescription2:\nOne of the co-leads on OpenAI\u2019s video generator, Sora, has left for Google.\nTim Brooks, who was heading development on Sora with William Peebles, announced in a post on X that he\u2019ll be joining Google DeepMind, Google\u2019s AI research division, to work on video generation technologies and \u201cworld simulators.\u201d\n\u201cI had an amazing two years at OpenAI making Sora,\u201d Brooks wrote. \u201cThank you to all the passionate and kind people I worked with.\u201d\nI will be joining @GoogleDeepMind to work on video generation and world simulators! Can't wait to collaborate with such a talented team.\nI had an amazing two years at OpenAI making Sora. Thank you to all the passionate and kind people I worked with. Excited for the next chapter! \u2014 Tim Brooks (@_tim_brooks) October 3, 2024\nGoogle DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis welcomed Brooks in a reply on X, saying that he\u2019ll help to \u201cmake the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality.\u201d World simulator is a rather vague phrase \u2014 and poorly defined \u2014 but DeepMind has applied it to models like its recently released Genie, which can generate playable, action-controllable virtual worlds from synthesized images, real photos, and even sketches.\nHere\u2019s how DeepMind researchers explained it in a 2023 paper: \u201cApplications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world.\u201d\nThrilled to welcome @_tim_brooks to @GoogleDeepMind. So excited to be working together to make the long-standing dream of a world simulator a reality!! https://t.co/dJrvXjMRBQ \u2014 Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) October 3, 2024\nBrooks was one of the first to work on Sora, having kickstarted the project at OpenAI in January 2023. On his LinkedIn, Brooks claims to have spearheaded the project\u2019s research direction and model training.\nHis departure comes as Sora, which has yet to be released, reportedly suffers from technical setbacks that position it poorly against rival systems from Luma, Runway, and others. Per The Information, the original system, revealed in February, took more than 10 minutes of processing time to make a 1-minute video clip. OpenAI is in the process of training an improved Sora that could quickly make clips, sources tell The Information.\nGoogle has its own video generation model, Veo, that it unveiled this spring at its annual I/O developer conference, and which will soon come to YouTube Shorts, YouTube\u2019s short-form video format, to let creators generate backgrounds and six-second clips.\nAside from tech-related hurdles, OpenAI has appeared to cede vaulable partnership ground to video generation challengers in recent months. Earlier this month, Runway signed a deal with Lionsgate, the studio behind the \u201cJohn Wick\u201d franchise, to train a custom video model on Lionsgate\u2019s movie catalog. Roughly a week later, Stability, which is developing its own set of video generation models, recruited \u201cAvatar,\u201d \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cTitanic\u201d director James Cameron to its board.\nOpenAI was said to be meeting with filmmakers and Hollywood studios earlier this year to demo Sora \u2014 ex-CTO Mira Murati attended Cannes \u2014 and the company has teamed up with a number of independent directors and some brands to showcase the system\u2019s capabilities.\nHowever, OpenAI has yet to announce a long-term collaboration with a major production house.\nBrooks \u2014 who, in a curious turn of events, is actually returning to Google, having once worked on the company\u2019s Pixel phones \u2014 is the latest in a string of high-profile resignations from OpenAI.\nCTO Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, and research VP Barret Zoph announced their departures in late September. Prominent research scientist Andrej Karpathy left OpenAI in February; months later, OpenAI co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever quit, along with ex-safety leader Jan Leike. In August, co-founder John Schulman said he would leave OpenAI. And Greg Brockman, the company\u2019s president, is on sabbatical.\n\ntitle3:\nDemand for Blackwell AI chip is 'insane'\ndescription3:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview with CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that demand for the company's next-generation artificial intelligence chip Blackwell is \"insane.\"\n\"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first,\" Huang said during the interview, which aired on Wednesday. Shares of Nvidia were up about 3% on Thursday morning.\nBlackwell, expected to cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is in hot demand from companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta and other firms building AI data centers to power products like ChatGPT and Copilot.\nNvidia has been the main beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, with shares up about 150% year-to-date. The company's revenue continued to surge during the fiscal second quarter to $30.04 billion, up 122% on an annual basis. It expects $32.5 billion in sales during the current quarter.\n\"At a time when the technology is moving so fast, it gives us an opportunity to triple down, to really drive the innovation cycle so that we can increase capabilities, increase our throughput, decrease our costs, decrease our energy consumption,\" Huang told CNBC. \"We're on a path to do that, and everything's on track.\"\nChief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in August that the company expects to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue in the company's fourth fiscal quarter.\nJensen said Nvidia plans to update its AI platform each year to increase performance by two to three times.\n\ntitle4:\nInvestors are scrambling to get into ElevenLabs, which may soon be valued at $3 billion\ndescription4:\nElevenLabs, a startup that makes AI tools for audio applications, is being approached by existing and new investors about a new round, which could value the company as highly as $3 billion, TechCrunch has learned.\nThe two-year-old company specializes in making AI tools to generate synthetic voices for audiobook narrations, and for real-time video dubbing into other languages.\nOne source at an interested VC firm told TechCrunch that investors are scrambling to get into the fast-growing company, and that their firm is willing to offer up to a $3 billion valuation, thinking that\u2019s what it might take to get into the next round. This person said a deal is likely in coming weeks.\nInvestors from two other firms confirmed that ElevenLabs is raising, but are passing on the deal. One of these sources heard secondhand that the company\u2019s annualized recurring revenue (ARR) has grown from $25 million at the end of last year to roughly $80 million in recent months, making it one of the fastest-growing startups developing actual applications for AI. (These investors asked for anonymity for competitive reasons.)\nIf accurate, that revenue figure means that investors could value ElevenLabs at around 38 times the most recent ARR figure. That multiple is slightly lower than some enterprise-focused companies such as Hebbia and Glean.\nThe lower multiple may be because a substantial portion of its revenue comes from consumer usage for narration and personal video dubbing. Consumer revenue is often considered more volatile than revenue generated from corporate clients.\nThe round, if completed at a $3 billion valuation, would triple ElevenLabs\u2019 valuation from its Series B in January, which was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross.\nThis would be Eleven Labs\u2019 third round in a little over a year, but TechCrunch couldn\u2019t learn the size of the potential investment, as the discussions with investors are still ongoing. Eleven Labs has already raised $100 million.\nWhile Google\u2019s Gemini and OpenAI have introduced their own human voice models, neither company\u2019s offerings can clone the speech of other humans like Eleven Labs. Other companies that are targeting the synthetic voice generation market include Murf, Tavus, Resemble AI, Respeecher and Lovo.\nElevenLabs didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
