Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday December 19), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft bought nearly 500K Nvidia Hopper chips this year\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft bought more than twice as many Nvidia Hopper chips this year than any of its biggest rivals.\nThe tech giant bought 485,000 Nvidia Hopper chips across 2024 according to reporting from the Financial Times, which cited data from tech consultancy Omdia. To compare, Meta bought 224,000 of the same flagship Nvidia chip this year. Microsoft\u2019s 2024 chip purchase more than tripled the number of Nvidia chips the company bought in 2023.\nMicrosoft is building its own custom AI chips, too, called Maia, which it announced at its Ignite conference in late 2023.\nThe company has really immersed itself in AI this year. Microsoft deepened its partnership with OpenAI and participated in the company\u2019s colossal $6.6 billion funding round in October. The company also signed a deal to reopen the infamous Three Mile Island nuclear plant in September and purchase all of the power that the plant creates for 20 years to help juice its data centers.\n\ntitle1:\nBroadcom (AVGO) earnings report Q4 2024\ndescription1:\nBroadcom reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday and said artificial intelligence revenue for the year more than tripled.\nThe chipmaker's stock jumped after Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company is developing custom AI chips with three large cloud customers. The shares were up 13% in extended trading.\nHere's how Broadcom did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Nov. 3:\nEarnings per share: $1.42, adjusted vs. $1.38 expected\n$1.42, adjusted vs. $1.38 expected Revenue: $14.05 billion vs. $14.09 billion expected\nBroadcom said it expects first-quarter revenue of about $14.6 billion, just ahead of the $14.57 billion average analyst estimate. For the fourth quarter, year-over-year revenue increased 51% from $9.3 billion.\nNet income in the fourth quarter came in at $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, up 23% from $3.52 billion, or 83 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier.\nIn its semiconductor solutions group, which includes the company's artificial intelligence chips, revenue increased 12% to $8.23 billion from $8.03 billion a year ago.\nBroadcom is seeing soaring demand from the boom in generative AI infrastructure. For the year, the company said AI revenue jumped 220% to $12.2 billion. Some of that growth is from ethernet networking parts, which are used to tie together thousands of AI chips.\n\"We see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive,\" Tan told investors on the earnings call. \"Specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.\"\nTan said Broadcom is currently developing AI chips with three very large customers, and he expects each of them them to deploy 1 million AI chips in networked clusters by 2027. Tan said the total market opportunity for its AI chips, which it calls XPUs, as well as parts for AI networking could be between $60 billion and $90 billion by 2027.\nBroadcom said its infrastructure software division generated $5.82 billion in revenue for the quarter, nearly tripling from last year's $1.96 billion. That includes a boost from the $69 billion acquisition of VMware, which was completed after the year-ago quarter.\nBroadcom said it would increase its quarterly dividend by 11% in fiscal 2025 to 59 cents per share.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to more accurately reflect Hock Tan's quote on the activity of hyperscalers.\nWATCH: Broadcom shares spike on earnings\n\ntitle2:\nMicron shares plunge on weak second-quarter guidance\ndescription2:\nSanjay Mehrotra, CEO of Micron Technology Inc., speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., April 26, 2024.\nMicron shares plunged 13% in extended trading on Wednesday after the chipmaker issued weak second-quarter guidance despite an earnings beat for the latest period.\nHere's how the company did compared to analysts' expectations surveyed by LSEG:\nEarnings per share: $1.79, adjusted vs. $1.75 expected\nRevenue: $8.71 billion vs. $8.71 billion expected\nFor the second quarter, Micron said it expects revenue of $7.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.43, plus or minus 10 cents. Analysts were expecting revenue of $8.98 billion and EPS of $1.91, according to LSEG.\nThe computer memory and storage company has seen its shares climb 22% year to date as of market close, trailing the Nasdaq's 29% gain. In the earnings report, Micron highlighted data centers and artificial intelligence ventures with Nvidia's processors as growth areas.\n\"While consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half of our fiscal year, said CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in a press release. \"We continue to gain share in the highest margin and strategically important parts of the market and are exceptionally well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth to create substantial value for all stakeholders.\"\nWATCH: Micron shares continue to slip on guidance\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline\ndescription3:\nChatGPT is coming to phones. No, not smartphones \u2014 landlines. Call 1-800-242-8478 (1-800-CHATGPT), and OpenAI\u2019s AI-powered assistant will respond as of Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201c[Our mission at] OpenAI is to make artificial general intelligence beneficial to all of humanity, and part of that is making it as accessible as possible to as many people as we can,\u201d OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said during a livestream. \u201cToday, we\u2019re taking the next step and bringing ChatGPT to your telephone.\u201d\nThe experience is more or less identical to Advanced Voice Mode, OpenAI\u2019s real-time conversational feature for ChatGPT \u2014 minus the multimodality. ChatGPT responds to the questions users ask over the phone and can handle tasks such as translating a sentence into a different language.\nOpenAI is offering 15 minutes of free calling for U.S. users, then the call just ends. The company notes that standard carrier fees may apply.\nYou can now talk to ChatGPT by calling 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478) in the U.S. or by sending a WhatsApp message to the same number\u2014available everywhere ChatGPT is. pic.twitter.com/R0XOPut7Qw \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 18, 2024\nBeginning Wednesday, ChatGPT is also available on WhatsApp for those who prefer to text the AI assistant. It\u2019s a basic back-and-forth exchange; given that it\u2019s WhatsApp, you won\u2019t find the customization options offered in the official ChatGPT app.\nAs with ChatGPT over the phone, you don\u2019t need an account for the WhatsApp experience \u2014 but there\u2019s a daily limit. Users will get a notice as they approach this limit, at which point they\u2019ll be able to continue chatting by downloading the ChatGPT app or using ChatGPT on desktop.\nOpenAI says it\u2019s working on additional features for the WhatsApp integration like image analysis and web search, but the company didn\u2019t share when those might ship.\n\u201cThis came out of a hack week project,\u201d Weil said. \u201cThe team built this just a few weeks ago, and we loved it, and they hustled really hard to ship it, and it\u2019s awesome to see it here. We\u2019re just getting started making ChatGPT more accessible to all of you.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nExclusive: Google's Gemini is forcing contractors to rate AI responses outside their expertise\ndescription4:\nGenerative AI may look like magic, but behind the development of these systems are armies of employees at companies like Google, OpenAI, and others, known as \u201cprompt engineers\u201d and analysts, who rate the accuracy of chatbots\u2019 outputs to improve their AI.\nBut a new internal guideline passed down from Google to contractors working on Gemini, seen by TechCrunch, has led to concerns that Gemini could be more prone to spouting out inaccurate information on highly sensitive topics, like healthcare, to regular people.\nTo improve Gemini, contractors working with GlobalLogic, an outsourcing firm owned by Hitachi, are routinely asked to evaluate AI-generated responses according to factors like \u201ctruthfulness.\u201d\nThese contractors were until recently able to \u201cskip\u201d certain prompts, and thus opt out of evaluating various AI-written responses to those prompts, if the prompt was way outside their domain expertise. For example, a contractor could skip a prompt that was asking a niche question about cardiology because the contractor had no scientific background.\nBut last week, GlobalLogic announced a change from Google that contractors are no longer allowed to skip such prompts, regardless of their own expertise.\nInternal correspondence seen by TechCrunch shows that previously, the guidelines read: \u201cIf you do not have critical expertise (e.g. coding, math) to rate this prompt, please skip this task.\u201d\nBut now the guidelines read: \u201cYou should not skip prompts that require specialized domain knowledge.\u201d Instead, contractors are being told to \u201crate the parts of the prompt you understand\u201d and include a note that they don\u2019t have domain knowledge.\nThis has led to direct concerns about Gemini\u2019s accuracy on certain topics, as contractors are sometimes tasked with evaluating highly technical AI responses about issues like rare diseases that they have no background in.\n\u201cI thought the point of skipping was to increase accuracy by giving it to someone better?\u201d one contractor noted in internal correspondence, seen by TechCrunch.\nContractors can now only skip prompts in two cases: if they\u2019re \u201ccompletely missing information\u201d like the full prompt or response, or if they contain harmful content that requires special consent forms to evaluate, the new guidelines show.\nGoogle did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s requests for comment by press time.\"\n\nResponse:",
