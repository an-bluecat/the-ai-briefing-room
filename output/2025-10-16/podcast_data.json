Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday October 17), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft, AWS, and Google are trying to drastically reduce China's role in their supply chains\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nAs geopolitical tensions intensify between the U.S. and China, tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are ramping up efforts to move production of their products and data centers outside of China, Nikkei reported, citing supply chain sources.\nIn particular, Microsoft wants to have up to 80% of the components needed to make its Surface notebooks and tablets, as well as its data centers, manufactured outside of China as soon as 2026, the report said. The scope of the change is \u201cquite wide\u201d and includes components and assembly for the company\u2019s future notebooks and server products, Nikkei cited a supply chain source as saying.\nThe company is reportedly asking its existing partners to prepare manufacturing capabilities outside the country starting next year, and it is also pushing to move some production of its Xbox gaming consoles to other parts of Asia.\nAmazon Web Services, meanwhile, is considering buying fewer printed circuit boards for its AI data centers from its long-time supplier SYE, and has conducted an evaluation of what it could need to do. And Google is pushing its suppliers to ramp up server production in Thailand, where it has already secured multiple partners for parts, components, and assembly, the report said.\nHowever, moving production outside the country so quickly would prove difficult, given the vast range of components involved and their Chinese partners\u2019 technological and manufacturing prowess, Nikkei noted.\nThe news follows a wave of retaliatory measures from both China and the U.S., who have taken turns to impose increasing tariffs on each other, tighten export controls on crucial components and resources, and restrict what tech can be sold.\nMicrosoft, Google, and Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon's Ring to partner with Flock, a network of AI cameras used by ICE, feds, and police\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nAmazon\u2019s surveillance camera maker Ring announced a partnership on Thursday with Flock, a maker of AI-powered surveillance cameras that share footage with law enforcement.\nNow agencies that use Flock can request that Ring doorbell users share footage to help with \u201cevidence collection and investigative work.\u201d\nFlock cameras work by scanning the license plates and other identifying information about cars they see. Flock\u2019s government and police customers can also make natural language searches of their video footage to find people who match specific descriptions. However, AI-powered technology used by law enforcement has been proven to exacerbate racial biases.\nOn the same day that Ring announced this partnership, 404 Media reported that ICE, the Secret Service, and the Navy had access to Flock\u2019s network of cameras. By partnering with Ring, Flock could potentially access footage from millions more cameras.\nRing has long had a poor track record with keeping customers\u2019 videos safe and secure. In 2023, the FTC ordered the company to pay $5.8 million over claims that employees and contractors had unrestricted access to customers\u2019 videos for years.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI pauses Sora video generations of Martin Luther King Jr.\ndescription2:\nOpenAI announced Thursday it paused the ability for users to generate videos resembling the late civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. using its AI video model, Sora. The company says it\u2019s adding this safeguard at the request of Dr. King\u2019s estate after some Sora users generated \u201cdisrespectful depictions\u201d of his image.\n\u201cWhile there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,\u201d OpenAI said in a post on X from its official newsroom account. \u201cAuthorized representatives or estate owners can request that their likeness not be used in Sora cameos.\u201d\nStatement from OpenAI and King Estate, Inc.\nThe Estate of Martin Luther King, Jr., Inc. (King, Inc.) and OpenAI have worked together to address how Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s likeness is represented in Sora generations. Some users generated disrespectful depictions of Dr.\u2026 \u2014 OpenAI Newsroom (@OpenAINewsroom) October 17, 2025\nThe restriction comes just a few weeks after OpenAI launched its social video platform, Sora, which allows users to create realistic AI-generated videos resembling historical figures, their friends, and users who elect to have their likeness recreated on the platform. The launch has stirred fervent public debate around the dangers of AI-generated videos, and how platforms should implement guardrails around the technology.\nDr. Bernice King, Dr. King\u2019s daughter, posted on Instagram last week asking people to stop sending her AI videos resembling her father. She joined Robin Williams\u2019 daughter, who also asked Sora users to stop generating AI videos of her father.\nThe Washington Post reported earlier this week that Sora users had created AI-generated videos of Dr. King making monkey noises and wrestling with another civil rights icon, Malcolm X. Scrolling through OpenAI\u2019s Sora app, it\u2019s easy to find crude videos resembling other historical figures, including artist Bob Ross, singer Whitney Houston, and former President John F. Kennedy.\nThe licensor of Dr. King\u2019s estate did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nBeyond how Sora represents humans, the launch has also raised a flurry of questions around how social media platforms should handle AI videos of copyrighted works. The Sora app is also full of videos depicting cartoons like SpongeBob, South Park, and Pok\u00e9mon.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Earlier in October, the company said it planned to give copyright holders more granular control over the types of AI videos that can be generated with their likeness. That may have been a response to Hollywood\u2019s initial reaction to Sora, which was not great.\nAs OpenAI adds restrictions to Sora, the company seems to be taking a more hands-off approach to moderating content in ChatGPT. OpenAI announced this week that it would allow adult users to have \u201cerotic\u201d chats with ChatGPT in the coming months.\nWith Sora, it seems that OpenAI is grappling with the concerns that come along with AI video generation. Some OpenAI researchers publicly wrestled with questions about the company\u2019s first AI-powered social media platform in the days after its launch, and how such a product fits into the nonprofit\u2019s mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company felt \u201ctrepidation\u201d about Sora on launch day.\nNick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, told me earlier this month that the best way to teach the world about a new technology is putting it out in the world. He said that\u2019s what the company learned with ChatGPT, and that\u2019s what OpenAI is finding with Sora, too. It seems the company is learning something about how to distribute this technology, as well.\n\ntitle3:\nReddit expands its AI-powered search to five new languages\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nReddit announced Thursday that it is expanding its AI-powered search experience to five new languages: French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. With this expansion, the feature is now available in countries like Brazil, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and Italy.\nUsers who have set one of these languages as their default, instead of English, can now chat with the AI in question-and-answer format. Reddit uses a Google AI model to power the feature.\nReddit first debuted AI-powered search last year and has been working to expand it in different ways. The feature is part of Reddit Answers, which lives alongside the platform\u2019s traditional search.\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman said in August that Reddit search has more than 70 million weekly users, while Reddit Answers is used by more than 6 million people. He also discussed plans to unify the search experience during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call.\nQ&A-style search and chat interfaces have been gaining popularity since ChatGPT integrated web search. Incumbent search engines like Google and Brave have introduced similar features to improve user engagement and retention. Newer startups like Perplexity have also gained steam with chat-based search interfaces.\n\ntitle4:\nDeel hits $17.3B valuation after raising $300M from big-name VCs\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAs entertaining as it\u2019s been for the tech industry to watch rival payroll decacorns Deel and Rippling sue each other over a corporate spying scandal, top-tier VCs are apparently not terribly scared off. Deel on Thursday announced that it has raised a $300 million Series E round co-led by A-list fintech VC firm Ribbit Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from existing investors like Coatue Management and General Catalyst.\nDeel says it\u2019s been profitable for three years and surpassed $1 billion in ARR, including having a month \u2014 September \u2014 that hit $100 million in revenue. Deel\u2019s business model focuses on serving global companies, handling the complexities of currency and employment regulation for far-flung international teams. It says it\u2019s now grown to 35,000+ customers with more than 1.5 million workers in over 150 countries.\nThose are the types of numbers that attract investment, pending lawsuits or no. (Rippling\u2019s California-filed lawsuit against Deel does not yet have a trial date and is in the discovery phase, according to court records.) Indeed, Ribbit\u2019s founder, Micky Malka, and a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz, gave Deel their full-throated supported in the announcement. In prepared statements, Malka said that Ribbit has been a \u201cfan\u201d of the HR company for a long time, because it\u2019s a \u201ca brand companies trust,\u201d and Horowitz said that a16z has been \u201cblown away\u201d by Deel\u2019s work to build \u201cthe best HR platform\u201d for global companies.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the lawsuits have not slowed down Rippling\u2019s fundraising efforts either. In May, Rippling raised a $450 million Series G round at a $16.8 billion valuation.\"\n\nResponse:",
