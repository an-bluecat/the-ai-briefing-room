Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday January 17), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple has worst day since August, down 11% from December peak\ndescription0:\nTim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, US, on Monday, June 10, 2024.\nApple stock closed down 4% on Thursday, its worst day since Aug. 5, following several reports of lackluster iPhone sales in China.\nThe iPhone maker's stock price is down nearly 12% from its most recent peak in December, and it's the worst-performing of the seven largest technology stocks so far in 2025.\nThe slide comes after a report Thursday from Canalys, a market research firm, which suggested that Apple had fallen to third place in terms of smartphones sold in China in 2024, behind homegrown manufacturers Vivo and Huawei.\nApple shipped 15% of the 284 million phones sold in China last year, according to the report, but that was down 17% on an annual basis. Vivo and Huawei, meanwhile, saw strong growth.\nTSMC, a key Apple supplier, on Thursday reported a smartphone sales forecast for the first quarter that suggested a nearly 6% sequential drop. TSMC, which makes the chips at the heart of Apple's devices, attributed the drop to seasonality. TSMC said AI chips comprised over half of its revenue in the fourth quarter, displacing smartphones, which had been its largest business.\nNotable Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo on Monday wrote that he expects iPhone shipments to decline 6% on an annual basis in the first half of 2025, with most of the decline happening in the second quarter. Kuo wrote that he believes Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that is not yet available in China, isn't boosting iPhone demand.\n\"There is no evidence of Apple Intelligence's ability to benefit hardware replacement cycles or service business,\" Kuo wrote.\nApple reports its December quarter results on Jan. 30.\nWATCH: Apple correction due to fundamentals, iPhone 17 upgrades expected, says Morgan Stanley's Woodring\n\ntitle1:\nTSMC fourth-quarter profit beats expectations on strong AI chip demand\ndescription1:\nA logo of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen during the TSMC global RnD Center opening ceremony in Hsinchu on July 28, 2023. (Photo by Amber Wang / AFP)\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's fourth-quarter revenue and profit beat expectations, as demand for advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications continued to surge.\nHere are TSMC's fourth-quarter results versus LSEG consensus estimates:\nNet revenue: 868.46 billion New Taiwan dollars ($26.36 billion), vs. NT$850.08 billion expected\nNet income: NT$374.68 billion, vs. NT$366.61 billion expected\nTSMC profit rose 57% from a year earlier to a record high, while revenue jumped 38.8%. The firm had forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion.\nAs the world's largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC produces advanced processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple and has benefited from the megatrend in favor of AI.\nTSMC's high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, drove sales in the fourth quarter, contributing 53% of revenue. That HPC revenue was up 19% from the previous quarter.\n\"The surging demand for AI chips has exceeded expectations in Q4,\" Brady Wang, associate director at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, adding that revenue was also bolstered by demand for the advanced chips in Apple's latest iPhone 16 model.\nThe Taiwan-based company first released its December revenue last week, bringing its annual total to NT$ 2.9 trillion \u2014 a record-breaking year in sales since the company went public in 1994.\n\"We observed robust AI related demand from our customers throughout 2024,\" Wendell Huang, chief financial officer and vice president at TSMC, said in an earnings call on Thursday, adding that revenue from AI accelerator products accounted for \"close to a mid-teens percentage\" of total revenue in 2024.\n\"Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025 as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues as a key enabler of AI applications,\" Huang added.\nHowever, TSMC may face some headwinds in 2025 from U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor shipments to China and uncertainty surrounding the trade policy of President-elect Donald Trump.\nTSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said the company will not attend Trump's inauguration as its philosophy is to keep a low profile, Reuters reported.\nTrump, who will assume office next week, has threatened to impose broad tariffs on imports and has previously accused Taiwan of \"stealing\" the U.S. chip business. .\nStill, Counterpoint's Wang forecasts 2025 to be another strong year for TSMC, with significant revenue growth fueled by strong and expanding demand for AI applications, both in diversity and volume.\nTaiwan-listed shares of TSMC gained 81% in 2024 and were trading 3.75% higher on Thursday.\nStocks of European semiconductor companies trading on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange rose Thursday, with ASML up 3.5%, ASM International gaining 3.75% and Besi rising 5.1%.\n\ntitle2:\nNintendo announces Switch 2 console with bigger screen and controllers\ndescription2:\nNintendo on Thursday said its long-awaited new Switch 2 hybrid will be available this year, touting a bigger screen and controllers, as the company looks to breathe new life into its struggling hardware business.\nThe business showed off the Switch 2 in a video trailer. The start of the clip features a current version of the console before detaching the two \"joy-con\" controllers to expand the size of the tablet they attach onto. The video then shows the joy cons growing in size and changing to a matte black color.\nThe joysticks and controller covers come in light blue and red variations. The joy con covers appear to be able to connect to the controllers magnetically when removed from the Switch 2's main tablet when propping the console up on its stand or docking it to play via a home TV.\nThe Switch 2 also features an improved kickstand that's U-shaped and can be placed further back, to the point where the console's position is almost flat on a surface. The look of the device is similar to mock-ups that were leaked online in the lead-up to the Switch 2's official announcement.\nNintendo didn't give a release date for the Switch 2, but said it would reveal more details during its next \"Nintendo Direct\" online event on April 2. The company revealed that the Switch 2 is backward compatible, meaning users will be able to play old Switch games on the new model.\nNintendo is hoping that the Switch 2 will help boost console sales. The current-generation Switch was released way back in March 2017 and has now reached an almost eight-year lifetime. Most console makers tend to wait roughly six to seven years before replacing them with a new model.\nNintendo took in net profit of 27.7 billion Japanese yen ($178.2 million) in its September quarter, down around 69% year-over-year. Company revenues sank 17% year-over-year to 276.7 billion Japanese yen.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon lays off about 200 employees in its stores unit\ndescription3:\nPackages ride on a conveyor belt during Cyber Monday, one of the company's busiest days at an Amazon fulfillment center on December 2, 2024 in Orlando, Florida.\nAmazon is laying off roughly 200 employees in its North America stores division, the company confirmed.\nThe core retail business, which Amazon also refers to as its stores division, encompasses a wide range of divisions, including its private label brands, Prime membership program, and consumables business.\n\"We've adjusted parts of our North America Stores team because we believe this structure will better enable us to deliver on our priorities,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. \"As part of these changes, we've made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles, and we're committed to supporting affected employees through their transition.\"\nThe layoffs included employees in the fashion and fitness business, among others, the spokesperson said. Business Insider earlier reported on the job cuts.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has moved to rein in costs across the company, laying off about 27,000 employees since the beginning of 2022. The bulk of the job cuts came in 2022 and 2023, though they have been ongoing at a smaller scale, and have impacted almost every business across the company's portfolio.\nAmazon has also shuttered some of its more experimental and unprofitable initiatives, including its telehealth offering, a brick-and-mortar delivery program, and try-on service for clothing and shoes.\nWATCH: Amazon Prime Video head of global sports on the brand's ambitions\n\ntitle4:\nFAA had to divert flights because of SpaceX Starship explosion\ndescription4:\nThe Federal Aviation Administration told TechCrunch it had to \u201cbriefly\u201d slow and divert a number of aircraft near the area where debris was seen falling after SpaceX\u2019s Starship exploded during a test flight Thursday.\nMultiple flights could be seen entering holding patterns or completely changing course in the airspace near Puerto Rico shortly after the ship exploded on its way to space, according to data from Flightradar24. The FAA said normal airspace operations have since resumed.\nAirports suffered disruptions as a result of the diversions. Miami International Airport posted a 30-minute delay warning due to the \u201crocket launch anomaly,\u201d according to the FAA\u2019s website. The Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida also cited the same reason for a short delay.\nSpaceX\u2019s Starship lifted off earlier Thursday from the company\u2019s facility in Boca Chica, Texas in what was the seventh test flight of the heavy launch system. SpaceX was able to catch the massive booster rocket on its descent with the launch tower for the second time ever. The company was hoping to test out a load of new equipment and upgrades on the Starship portion.\nSpaceX had already caught some flak this week when Qantas airlines complained that debris from the spaceflight company\u2019s rocket launches was apparently causing delays of some flights.\nNot long after the ship broke apart Thursday, videos and images of the debris went viral on social media. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared one of the videos on X, writing: \u201cSuccess is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
