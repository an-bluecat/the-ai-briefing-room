Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Anthropic initially set out to raise $2 billion, but investors have now agreed to a larger tranche, per the WSJ.\nLightspeed Venture Partners, General Catalyst, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX are said to be in talks to participate in the coming round. Should it top out at $3.5 billion, it\u2019d bring Anthropic\u2019s total raised to around $18 billion.\nAnthropic, which this week released a new flagship AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, recently hit about $1.2 billion in annualized revenue, according to the WSJ. But it\u2019s still losing money. The company intends to put the proceeds from its next round toward developing more capable AI technologies.\n\ntitle1:\nApple commits $500B to US manufacturing, including a new AI server facility in Houston\ndescription1:\nThe U.S. government is leaning hard on tech companies to make more commitments to building their businesses in the country, and Big Tech is falling in line. On Monday, Apple laid out its own plans in that area: It will spend $500 billion over the next four years in areas like high-end manufacturing, engineering, and education covering technologies like artificial intelligence and chip making.\nBig projects will include a new factory in Houston, Texas, to produce servers that support Apple\u2019s in-house AI effort, Apple Intelligence; doubling the value of Apple\u2019s U.S. Advanced Manufacturing Fund to $10 billion; a new academy in Michigan to train people to work in next-generation factories; and more R&D.\nSome of this is not \u201cnew\u201d news. Apple has worked for years with thousands of suppliers across the U.S. in areas like chip making \u2014 currently 24 factories across 12 states \u2014 alongside directly employing people in the country. Globally, Apple employs 164,000 people, according to recent filings. It does not break out how many of them are in the U.S. specifically. It said today it plans to hire another 20,000 people in the next four years. But again, it does not specify if these people will be in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nNevertheless, Apple\u2019s news is significant because of what it underscores. First, there is the bigger effort that the U.S. has been making to expand its economic footing, specifically to remove some of the reliance that the U.S. currently has on ecosystems outside of the U.S. itself, such as China for manufacturing. The U.S. is waging a fairly drastic effort to shift investment in line with that, for example, by floating new tariffs on certain goods in an effort to drive more national production.\nThe magic number is $500 billion: It\u2019s also the amount that SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI are apparently committing to their own major AI data center project.\nApple, as a major consumer electronics company, relies heavily on production outside of the U.S. The exercise of laying out plans to invest within the U.S. will not completely replace that, now or ever, but becomes a bone \u2014 a very valuable bone \u2014 that it can throw to show that it\u2019s making efforts too.\nSecond, the focus on artificial intelligence in Apple\u2019s news today should be noted. The major server factory that it will be building will be focused on building machines that can handle AI compute. Similarly, the ecosystem fund and training budget are largely focused on skills and manufacturing of hardware that will be used in AI systems.\nOf note: It is not clear what kinds of tax breaks (if any) companies will get on the investments such as the ones Apple listed today. That will be top of mind for companies, their investors, and hopefully the U.S. public. Apple did note that it \u201cremains one of the largest U.S. taxpayers, having paid more than $75 billion in U.S. taxes over the past five years, including $19 billion in 2024 alone.\u201d\nThe news today, in any case, is being represented as Apple\u2019s own commitment to growing America\u2019s industry profile in the world.\n\u201cWe are bullish on the future of American innovation, and we\u2019re proud to build on our long-standing U.S. investments with this $500 billion commitment to our country\u2019s future,\u201d said Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, in a statement. \u201cFrom doubling our Advanced Manufacturing Fund, to building advanced technology in Texas, we\u2019re thrilled to expand our support for American manufacturing. And we\u2019ll keep working with people and companies across this country to help write an extraordinary new chapter in the history of American innovation.\u201d\nOne of the bigger specific projects announced today will be a new 250,000-square-foot AI server manufacturing facility in Houston \u2014 taking on building services that up to now have been manufactured in other countries. Ground breaks later this year, and it will be completed by 2026, it said.\nThe project is important not just in value but also intention: Apple is doubling down on how it believes AI will be used within its products and services. So the project is coming along with an expansion of server capacity in Apple\u2019s other data centers in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\u201cTeams at Apple designed the servers to be incredibly energy efficient, reducing the energy demands of Apple data centers,\u201d Apple said, although it also claimed these are already run on renewable energy.\nThe manufacturing fund, in contrast, will be used to help finance expansions for its partners, including a \u201cmultibillion-dollar commitment\u201d to TSMC for advanced silicon made in the latter company\u2019s Fab 21 facility in Arizona. Apple said it is Fab 21\u2019s largest customer.\nApple has not specified how much it has earmarked for educational initiatives aimed at training workforces \u2014 although the costs of building factories or investing in frontier-level research and development are likely to be substantial.\nThe first effort in that vein will be a new Apple Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, it said, where \u201cApple engineers, along with experts from top universities such as Michigan State,\u201d will work in consultation with SMBs to help them implement \u201cAI and smart manufacturing techniques.\u201d There are a large number of smaller businesses in that region that have worked in concert in other legacy industries like automotive, and it will be worth watching to see how and if they make the transition as envisioned.\n\ntitle2:\nChegg sues Google over AI search summaries\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nEdtech company Chegg has sued Google claiming that the tech giant\u2019s AI summaries of search results have hurt Chegg\u2019s traffic and revenue.\nIn the suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Chegg accuses Google of unfair competition \u2014 specifically reciprocal dealing, monopoly maintenance, and unjust enrichment. Google, Chegg claims, forces companies to supply their content in order to be included in Google Search, unfairly exercising its monopoly power in search to reap the benefits of third-party IP.\nChegg is seeking compensatory damages and other forms of relief, as well as an injunction on Google\u2019s alleged \u201cunlawful and unfair\u201d conduct.\nChegg is only the latest publisher to take issue with Google\u2019s efforts to inject Google Search with AI. A number of news outlets claim they\u2019ve seen an impact on traffic from Google\u2019s AI summaries in search, which draw from sources around the web to answer Google Search user queries.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this post if we hear back.\n\ntitle3:\nSpaceX says Starship self-destructed after propellant leaks caused fires and comms blackout\ndescription3:\nSpaceX said Monday that last month\u2019s Starship explosion was brought on by a cascading series of events caused by propellant leaks \u2014 a problem the company says has been addressed ahead of an eighth test flight that could happen as early as Friday.\nThe spaceflight company is still waiting for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to either officially close the \u201cmishap investigation\u201d into the explosion, or specially authorize SpaceX to perform the flight while the investigation continues.\nThis is, notably, the first time SpaceX has been subjected to a mishap investigation while CEO Elon Musk is operating inside the United States government, with workers from his so-called Department of Government Efficiency actively making changes at the FAA. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSpaceX\u2019s January test of Starship started off fine enough. The company was hoping to test out a number of upgrades to the Super Heavy booster, the launch-and-catch tower, and on Starship itself. The heavy-lift rocket system launched without any problem and headed off to space, with the booster eventually separating and coming back down to the ground in Texas where it was caught by the tower.\nThe problems started about two minutes after Starship ignited its own rocket engines to get to orbit. The company wrote in a blog post that \u201ca flash was observed in the aft section of the vehicle near one of the Raptor vacuum engines.\u201d Sensors onboard the ship started picking up a rise in pressure after the flash \u201cindicative of a leak\u201d of propellant, according to SpaceX.\nAnother flash was seen two minutes later, and SpaceX says \u201csustained fires\u201d began in that section of Starship due to the leaks. The fires caused \u201call but one of Starship\u2019s engines to execute controlled shut down sequences and ultimately led to a loss of communication with the ship.\u201d\nSpaceX says the leaks were most likely caused by vibrations that exceeded what the company expected from testing, \u201cwhich led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system.\u201d The automatic in-flight abort system eventually triggered the destruction of the ship following the fires and communications blackout.\nThat explosion led to a spectacular display over the islands of Turks and Caicos, and also resulted in the FAA diverting a number of flights to avoid any danger. SpaceX claims that all of the Starship debris \u201ccame down within the pre-planned Debris Response Area\u201d \u2014 a sort of safe-zone that it typically negotiates ahead of flights with government agencies. Residents have been posting photos of debris washing up on beaches and at least one vehicle was struck, receiving minor damage.\nSpaceX says it has made changes to the lines that send fuel to Starship\u2019s engines, tweaked the temperature of the propellant, and has added extra vents and \u201ca new purge system\u201d to make the aft section in question \u201cmore robust to propellant leakage.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nUK\u2019s internet watchdog toughens approach to deepfake porn\ndescription4:\nOfcom, the U.K.\u2019s internet safety regulator, has published another new draft guidance as it continues to implement the Online Safety Act (OSA) \u2014 the latest set of recommendations aim to support in-scope firms to meet legal obligations to protect women and girls from online threats like harassment and bullying, misogyny, and intimate image abuse.\nThe government has said that protecting women and girls is a priority for its implementation of the OSA. Certain forms of (predominantly) misogynist abuse \u2014 such as sharing intimate images without consent or using AI tools to create deepfake porn that targets individuals \u2014 are explicitly set out in the law as enforcement priorities.\nThe online safety regulation, which was approved by the U.K. parliament back in September 2023, has faced criticism that it\u2019s not up to the task of reforming platform giants, despite containing substantial penalties for non-compliance \u2014 up to 10% of global annual turnover.\nChild safety campaigners have also expressed frustration over how long it\u2019s taking to implement the law, as well as doubting whether it will have the desired effect.\nIn an interview with the BBC in January, even the technology minister Peter Kyle \u2014 who inherited the legislation from the previous government \u2014 called it \u201cvery uneven\u201d and \u201cunsatisfactory.\u201d But the government is sticking with the approach. Part of the discontent around the OSA can be traced back to the long lead time ministers allowed for implementing the regime, which requires parliament to approve Ofcom compliance guidance.\nHowever, enforcement is expected to start to kick in soon in relation to core requirements on tackling illegal content and child protection. Other aspects of OSA compliance will take longer to implement. And Ofcom concedes this latest package of practice recommendations won\u2019t become fully enforceable until 2027 or later.\nApproaching the enforcement start line\n\u201cThe first duties of the Online Safety Act are coming into force next month,\u201d Ofcom\u2019s Jessica Smith, who led development of the female safety-focused guidance, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cSo we will be enforcing against some of the core duties of the Online Safety Act ahead of this guidance [itself becoming enforceable].\u201d\nThe new draft guidance on keeping women and girls safe online is intended to supplement earlier broader Ofcom guidance on illegal content \u2014 which also, for example, provides recommendations for protecting minors from seeing adult content online.\nIn December, the regulator published its finalized guidance on how platforms and services should shrink risks related to illegal content, an area where child protection is a clear priority.\nIt has also previously produced a Children\u2019s Safety Code, which recommends online services dial up age checks and content filtering to ensure kids are not exposed to inappropriate content such as pornography. And as it\u2019s worked toward implementing the online safety regime, it\u2019s also developed recommendations for age assurance technologies for adult content websites, with the aim of pushing porn sites to take effective steps preventing minors from accessing age-inappropriate content.\nThe latest set of guidance was developed with help from victims, survivors, women\u2019s advocacy groups, and safety experts, per Ofcom. It covers four major areas where the regulator says females are disproportionately affected by online harm \u2014 namely: online misogyny; pile-ons and online harassment; online domestic abuse; and intimate image abuse.\nSafety by design\nOfcom\u2019s top-line recommendation urges in-scope services and platforms to take a \u201csafety by design\u201d approach. Smith told us the regulator wants to encourage tech firms to \u201ctake a step back\u201d and \u201cthink about their user experience in the round.\u201d While she acknowledged some services have put in place some measures that are helpful in shrinking online risks in this area, she argued there\u2019s still a lack of holistic thinking when it comes to prioritizing the safety of women and girls.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really asking for is just a sort of step change in how the design processes work,\u201d she told us, saying the goal is to ensure that safety considerations are baked into product design.\nShe highlighted the rise of image generating AI services, which she noted have led to \u201cmassive\u201d growth in deepfake intimate image abuse as an example of where technologists could have taken proactive measures to crimp the risks of their tools being weaponized to target women and girls \u2014 yet did not.\n\u201cWe think that there are sensible things that services could do at the design phase which would help to address the risk of some of those harms,\u201d she suggested.\nExamples of \u201cgood\u201d industry practices Ofcom highlights in the guidance includes online services taking actions such as:\nRemoving geolocation by default (to shrink privacy/stalking risks);\nConducting \u201cabusability\u201d testing to identify how a service could be weaponized/misused;\nTaking steps to boost account security;\nDesigning in user prompts that are intended to make posters think twice before posting abusive content;\nAnd offering accessible reporting tools that let users report issues.\nAs is the case with all Ofcom\u2019s OSA guidance, not every measure will be relevant for every type or size of service \u2014 since the law applies to online services large and small, and cuts across various arenas, from social media, to online dating, gaming, forums and messaging apps, to name a few. So a big part of the work for in-scope companies will be understanding what compliance means in the context of their product.\nWhen asked if Ofcom had identified any services currently meeting the guidance\u2019s standards, Smith suggested they had not. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work to do across the industry,\u201d she said.\nShe also tacitly acknowledged that there may be growing challenges given some of the retrograde steps taken vis-\u00e0-vis trust and safety by some major industry players. For example, since taking over Twitter and rebranding the social network as X, Elon Musk has gutted its trust and safety headcount \u2014 in favor of pursuing what he has framed as a maximalist approach to free speech.\nIn recent months, Meta \u2014 which owns Facebook and Instagram \u2014 appears to have taken some mimicking steps, saying it\u2019s ending thirty-party fact-checking contracts in favor of deploying an X-style \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system of crowdsourced labeling on content disputes, for example.\nTransparency\nSmith suggested that Ofcom\u2019s response to such high-level shifts \u2014 where operators\u2019 actions could risk dialing up, rather than damping down, online harms \u2014 will focus on using transparency and information-gathering powers it wields under the OSA to illustrate impacts and drive user awareness.\nSo, in short, the tactic here looks set to be \u201cname and shame\u201d \u2014 at least in the first instance.\n\u201cOnce we finalize the guidance, we will produce a [market] report \u2026 about who is using the guidance, who is following what steps, what kind of outcomes they\u2019re achieving for their users who are women and girls, and really shine a light on what protections are in place on different platforms so that users can make informed choices about where they spend their time online,\u201d she told us.\nSmith suggested that companies wanting to avoid the risk of being publicly shamed for poor performance on women\u2019s safety will be able to turn to Ofcom\u2019s guidance for \u201cpractical steps\u201d on how to improve the situation for their users, and address the risk of reputational harm too.\n\u201cPlatforms that are operating in the U.K. will have to comply with the U.K. law,\u201d she added in the context of the discussion on major platforms de-emphasizing trust and safety. \u201cSo that means complying with the illegal harms duties and the protection of children duties under the Online Safety Act.\u201d\n\u201cI think this is where our transparency powers also come in \u2014 if the industry is changing direction and harms are increasing, this is where we will be able to shine a light and share relevant information with U.K. users, with media, with parliamentarians.\u201d\nTech to tackle deepfake porn\nOne type of online harm where Ofcom is explicitly beefing up its recommendations even before it\u2019s actively started OSA enforcement is intimate image abuse \u2014 as the latest draft guidance suggests the use hash matching to detect and remove such abusive imagery, whereas earlier Ofcom recommendations did not go that far.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve included additional steps in this guidance that go beyond what we\u2019ve already set out in our codes,\u201d Smith noted, confirming Ofcom plans to update its earlier codes to incorporate this change \u201cin the near future.\u201d\n\u201cSo this is a way of saying to platforms that you can get ahead of that enforceable requirement by following the steps that are set down in this guidance,\u201d she added.\nOfcom recommended the use of hash matching technology to counter intimate image abuse due to a substantial increase in this risk, per Smith \u2014 especially in relation to AI-generated deepfake image abuse.\n\u201cThere was more deepfake intimate image abuse reported in 2023 than in all previous years combined,\u201d she noted, adding that Ofcom has also gathered more evidence on the effectiveness of hash matching to tackle this harm.\nThe draft guidance as a whole will now undergo consultation \u2014 with Ofcom inviting feedback until May 23, 2025 \u2014 after which it will produce final guidance by the end of this year.\nA full 18 months after that, Ofcom will then produce its first report reviewing industry practice in this area.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting into 2027 before we\u2019re producing our first report on who\u2019s doing what [to protect women and girls online] \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing to stop platforms acting now,\u201d she added.\nResponding to criticism that the OSA is taking Ofcom too long to implement, she said it\u2019s right that the regulator consults on compliance measures. However, with the final measure taking effect next month, she noted that Ofcom anticipates a shift in the conversation surrounding the issue, too.\n\u201c[T]hat will really start to change the conversation with platforms, in particular,\u201d she predicted, adding that it will also be in a position to start demonstrating progress on moving the needle when it comes to reducing online harms.\"\n\nResponse:",
