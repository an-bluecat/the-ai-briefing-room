Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The company says it\u2019s identified a pathway to recovery and is working on a fix as of 4:55pm PT Wednesday evening.\nIt remains unclear what the cause of the outage is. OpenAI said ChatGPT, the API, and Sora are slowly coming back online, according to an update posted to its status page around 7pm PT. OpenAI first started investigating this outage around 3:17pm PT.\n\u201cChatGPT is currently unavailable,\u201d reads an error message that appears when visiting ChatGPT.com. \u201cWe have identified the issue and are working to roll out a fix.\u201d\nLogging onto ChatGPT on Wednesday produced this message. (image credit: OpenAI)\nThe ChatGPT outage comes on the same day that OpenAI launched its integration with Apple in iOS 18.2, which could have caused an influx of traffic on the company\u2019s servers. Some users reported on social media that ChatGPT was not working in Apple Intelligence because of the downtime on Wednesday.\nEarlier this week, OpenAI also launched Sora publicly. CEO Sam Altman said the startup didn\u2019t anticipate the amount of interest it would receive, and had to limit the number of users that could sign up. Many users who did sign up were unable to generate videos on launch day, receiving a message that OpenAI\u2019s servers were at capacity.\nError message shown when visiting Sora.com on Wednesday (image credit: openai)\nThe outage also follows another global service interruption to Meta\u2019s products early Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear if these outages were related.\nThis outage for OpenAI\u2019s products falls on day five of the company\u2019s \u201c12 days of shipmas\u201d event, where the company has shipped new products everyday leading up the holiday season. So far in the program, OpenAI has announced the full release of its o1 reasoning model, a reinforcement fine-tuning research program, the release of Sora, some updates to Canvas, and the Apple Intelligence integration.\nWe're experiencing an outage right now. We have identified the issue and are working to roll out a fix.\nSorry and we'll keep you updated! \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) December 12, 2024\nOpenAI referred TechCrunch to a tweet from its official X account when we reached out for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft will take an $800M hit over Cruise robotaxi shutdown\ndescription1:\nGM\u2019s decision to shut down its Cruise robotaxi program continues to ripple through the market, extending to the self-driving car company\u2019s minority investors.\nMicrosoft, which in 2021 made an investment into Cruise, will take $800 million impairment charge as a result of GM\u2019s actions, according to a regulatory filing. Microsoft said the charge will be recorded in other income and expense and was not included in its second quarter guidance provided on October 30, 2024. It is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately $0.09 to second quarter diluted earnings per share, according to the filing.\nGM owns about 90% of Cruise. GM said it has agreements with other minority shareholders to buy back shares and raise its ownership to more than 97%. GM previously brought on a number of external investors including Microsoft, Walmart, Softbank, T.Rowe Price and Honda as the company sought to raise the billions in capital needed to bring robotaxis to the public.\nCruise raised $2 billion in January 2021 in a round that included Microsoft as well as GM and partner Honda. That raise pushed Cruise\u2019s valuation up to $30 billion. The two companies also struck a long-term strategic partnership that included plans for Cruise to use Azure, Microsoft\u2019s cloud and edge computing platform, for its autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service.\nGeneral Motors announced Tuesday it would no longer fund development of the robotaxi and instead absorb its self-driving car subsidiary Cruise and combine it with the automaker\u2019s own efforts to develop driver assistance features \u2014 and eventually fully autonomous personal vehicles. GM acquired the self-driving startup Cruise in March 2016 for $1 billion. Since then, GM has spent more than $10 billion on the company in a bid to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology via a robotaxi business.\nMinority investor Honda said Wednesday it will stop funding a joint venture with General Motors and Cruise to launch a robotaxi service in Japan.\n\ntitle2:\nApple launches its ChatGPT integration with Siri\ndescription2:\nApple released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.\nThe ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple's software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won't store requests. The integration uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\nApple users don't need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.\nThe iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup's marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company's suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.\nApple released the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.\nThe company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.\nMany investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.\nThe integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.\nUsers need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.\nAfter updating to the latest Apple software, users will be promoted to set up Apple Intelligence. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple's AI models, that the service needs to operate.\nThe Wednesday updates also include Apple's image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.\nWATCH: MLS Commissioner on Apple media deal: We have more subscribers than either of us thought we would\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle releases the first of its Gemini 2.0 AI models\ndescription3:\nGoogle released the first version of its Gemini 2.0 family of artificial intelligence models on Wednesday.\nGemini 2.0 Flash, as the model is called, is available in a chat version for users globally while an experimental multimodal version of the model, with text-to-speech and image generation features, is available to developers.\n\"If Gemini 1.0 was about organizing and understanding information, Gemini 2.0 is about making it much more useful,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement.\nGoogle's latest large language model outperforms its predecessors in the majority of user request areas, such as code generation and the ability to provide factually correct responses from user requests. One area where it is inferior to Gemini 1.5 Pro is when it comes to evaluating longer contexts.\nTo access the chat-optimized version of the experimental Flash 2.0, Gemini users can select it in the model drop-down menu on desktop and mobile web. It will be available on the Gemini mobile app soon, the company said.\nThe multimodal version of Gemini Flash 2.0 will be available via the Google's AI Studio and Vertex AI developer platforms.\nGeneral availability of Gemini 2.0 Flash's multimodal version will come in January, along with more Gemini 2.0 model sizes, Google said Wednesday. The company said it also plans to expand Gemini 2.0 to more Google products in early 2025.\nGemini 2.0 represents Google's latest efforts in the tech industry's increasingly competitive AI race. Google is competing against the likes of rivals like tech giants Microsoft and Meta and startups like OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, Perplexity and Anthropic, which makes Claude.\nAlong with the release of the new Flash model are other research prototypes aimed at developing more \"agentic\" AI models and experiences. Agentic models, according to the company, \"can understand more about the world around you, think multiple steps ahead, and take action on your behalf, with your supervision.\"\nLast week, in a conversation with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times' DealBook Summit, Pichai challenged Microsoft's AI advancement, saying he'd \"love to do a side-by-side comparison\" of the two companies' models \"any day, any time.\"\nWATCH: Google unveils Willow quantum computing chip\n\ntitle4:\nAlphabet and Tesla reach fresh records, joining Amazon and Meta\ndescription4:\nAlphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh records on Wednesday, closing at all-time highs alongside Amazon and Meta as the tech megacaps lifted the Nasdaq past 20,000 for the first time.\nTech's seven trillion-dollar companies added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day.\nFor Alphabet, the two-day 11% rally was driven by the company's launch of its latest quantum computing chip, which it revealed on Monday and described as a \"breakthrough\" and \"an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications\" in drug discovery, battery design and other areas.\nAlphabet closed at $195.40 on Wednesday, topping its prior high of $191.18, which it reached on July 10.\nTesla had been below its previous record for much longer. Shares of the electric vehicle maker jumped almost 6% on Wednesday to $424.77, climbing above their prior closing high of $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021. The stock has soared 69% since Donald Trump's election victory last month, on Wall Street's optimism that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's cozy relationship with the incoming president will pay dividends.\nAmazon, Apple and Meta have all been regularly reaching new highs, though Apple slipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Microsoft , meanwhile, is about 4% below its high reached in July, and chipmaker Nvidia is 6% off its record from last month.\nThe outsized weighting of tech's megacaps has pushed the Nasdaq to a 33% gain for the year. The index rose 1.8% on Wednesday to close at an all-time high of 20,034.89.\nThe market has rallied since Trump's victory on Nov. 4, partly on expectations that the new administration will dial down regulatory pressure on the tech industry and allow for more dealmaking.\nOn Tuesday, Trump named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission, replacing Lina Khan, who is best known for blocking the top tech companies' acquisition efforts. Ferguson, currently one of the FTC's five commissioners, \"will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\nTom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" that investors see more gains in tech with the expectation that a Federal Reserve rate cut is coming this month. The consumer price index showed a 12-month inflation rate of 2.7% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday, further solidifying the market outlook for a cut.\n\"We know that when interest rates fall, the megacaps actually are very sensitive to that, and I think today was a day where the odds of a December cut increased,\" Lee said. \"That's actually bullish for tech.\"\nWATCH: What Fundstrat's Tom Lee expects from the markets in 2025\"\n\nResponse:",
