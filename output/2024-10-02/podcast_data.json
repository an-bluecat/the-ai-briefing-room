Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday October 3), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI raises at $157 billion valuation; Microsoft, Nvidia join round\ndescription0:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the Microsoft Build conference at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on May 21, 2024.\nOpenAI has closed its long-awaited funding round at a valuation of $157 billion, including the $6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies.\nWhile OpenAI didn't name the investors in Wednesday's press release, a person with knowledge of the matter said the round was led by Thrive Capital and included participation from existing backer Microsoft as well as chipmaker Nvidia , SoftBank and others. Thrive planned to invest $1 billion in the round, CNBC previously reported.\nOpenAI's rapid ascent, which began with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, has been the biggest story in the tech industry over the last couple years, bringing the concept of generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and paving the way for tens of billions of dollars of investments in AI infrastructure.\n\"The new funding will allow us to double down on our leadership in frontier AI research, increase compute capacity, and continue building tools that help people solve hard problems,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog post Wednesday.\n\"We look forward to continuing our partnership with OpenAI,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.\nOpenAI generated $300 million in revenue last month, up 1,700% since the beginning of last year, CNBC confirmed last week, following reporting by The New York Times. The company expects to bring in $11.6 billion in sales next year, up from $3.7 billion in 2024, according to a person close to OpenAI who asked not to be named because the financials are confidential.\nBut all that revenue is extremely costly, as OpenAI has to ramp up purchases of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to train and run its large language models. The company expects to lose about $5 billion this year, the person said. Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a key partner as the software giant bolsters its Azure cloud business.\nEarlier this year, OpenAI was valued at a reported $80 billion, up from $29 billion in 2023. Following the viral growth of ChatGPT, momentum has continued with new products for businesses and an expansion into AI-generated photos and videos.\nOpenAI now has 250 million weekly active users on ChatGPT, CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC in a statement. There are also 11 million ChatGPT Plus subscribers and 1 million paying business users on ChatGPT, a person close to the company said.\n\"AI is already personalizing learning, accelerating healthcare breakthroughs, and driving productivity,\" Friar said in the statement. \"And this is just the start.\"\nOpenAI is experiencing plenty of growing pains along the way, including the loss of key executives, a trend that continued through last week.\nLast Wednesday, OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, who briefly served as interim CEO, said she would be leaving after 6\u00bd years. Shortly after that, research chief Bob McGrew and Barret Zoph, a research vice president, said they were leaving the company.\nIn an interview the next day at Italian Tech Week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, \"I think this will be hopefully a great transition for everyone involved and I hope OpenAI will be stronger for it, as we are for all of our transitions.\"\nAlso on Thursday, OpenAI held an all-hands meeting, following the board's decision to consider restructuring the company to a for-profit business, according to a separate person with knowledge of the matter. Altman said the departures were not related to the potential restructuring, contrary to some media reports.\nShould the change occur, the nonprofit segment would remain as a separate entity, the source said.\nAt Thursday's meeting, Altman denied reports of plans for him to receive a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, calling that information \"just not true,\" according to a person who was in attendance.\nOpenAI Chairman Bret Taylor told CNBC in a statement last week that while the board has talked about the matter, no specific figures are on the table.\n\"The board has had discussions about whether it would be beneficial to the company and our mission to have Sam be compensated with equity, but no specific figures have been discussed nor have any decisions been made,\" Taylor said.\nThe latest funding round also included participation from Khosla Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Fidelity, MGX and Tiger Global, sources told CNBC.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk's decade-long journey to Tesla robotaxis\ndescription1:\nFor a decade, Elon Musk has championed the idea that one day Tesla cars will drive themselves as robotaxis. Next week, the company will unveil the design of its autonomous cabs.\nDespite years of bold predictions and missed deadlines, fans of the company are holding out hope that Musk will finally deliver at an Oct. 10 event. Regardless of what the company showcases at its robotaxi day, experts are skeptical of the company's strategy, citing its Auotpilot and FSD technology as a barometer for Tesla's progress, or lack thereof.\nIn the decade that Musk has promised driverless vehicles, competitors have made them.\nAlphabet -owned Waymo already operates a commercial robotaxi service in several U.S. cities, surpassing 100,000 paid rides per week as of August. Amazon -owned Zoox began testing rides for employees in February 2023 with ambitions to launch its own robotaxi service. In China, Pony.ai and Baidu are running commercial robotaxi services too.\nThe market could be lucrative. In one bullish estimate, Raymond James predicts $50 billion in annual robotaxi bookings by 2030.\nWith U.S. EV sales growth slowing, there's a lot riding on Tesla's potential pivot to autonomy.\nWatch the video to see the road Tesla has taken to realizing its robotaxi ambitions.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla (TSLA) Q3 2024 vehicle delivery and production numbers\ndescription2:\nTesla posted its third-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report on Wednesday. The stock fell as much as 3.7% after the report.\nHere are the key numbers:\nTotal deliveries Q3 2024: 462,890\nTotal production Q3 2024: 469,796\nAnalysts were expecting deliveries of 463,310 in the period ended Sept. 30, according to estimates compiled by FactSet StreetAccount.\nBased on some other estimates, Tesla missed by even more. According to LSEG, analysts on average were expecting deliveries of 469,828 vehicles. An independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans who publishes as \"Troy Teslike\" predicted the EV maker would report deliveries of 472,000 in the quarter.\nTesla also sends its own company-compiled consensus to select investors and influencers. In its most recent survey of 30 analysts' estimates, Tesla had said analysts were expecting 461,978 deliveries, which would suggest a beat.\nDeliveries are not defined in Tesla's financial disclosures, but are the closest approximation to units sold reported by the company. It's one of the most closely watched metrics on Wall Street.\nIn the year-ago period, Tesla reported 435,059 deliveries and production of 430,488 EVs. Last quarter, the company reported 443,956 deliveries, and production of 410,831 vehicles.\nTesla is facing increased competitive pressure, especially in China, from companies like BYD and Geely, along with a new generation of automakers, including Li Auto and Nio.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta confirms it may train its AI on any image you ask Ray-Ban Meta AI to analyze\ndescription3:\nWe recently asked Meta if it trains AI on photos and videos that users take on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. The company originally didn\u2019t have much to say.\nSince then, Meta has offered TechCrunch a bit more color.\nIn short, any image you share with Meta AI can be used to train its AI.\n\u201c[I]n locations where multimodal AI is available (currently US and Canada), images and videos shared with Meta AI may be used to improve it per our Privacy Policy,\u201d said Meta policy communications manager Emil Vazquez in an email to TechCrunch.\nIn a previous emailed statement, a spokesperson clarified that photos and videos captured on Ray-Ban Meta are not used by Meta for training as long as the user doesn\u2019t submit them to AI. However, once you ask Meta AI to analyze them, those photos fall under a completely different set of policies.\nIn other words, the company is using its first consumer AI device to create a massive stockpile of data that could be used to create ever-more powerful generations of AI models. The only way to \u201copt out\u201d is to simply not use Meta\u2019s multimodal AI features in the first place.\nThe implications are concerning because Ray-Ban Meta users may not understand they\u2019re giving Meta tons of images \u2013 perhaps showing the inside of their homes, loved ones, or personal files \u2013 to train its new AI models. Meta\u2019s spokespeople tell me this is clear in the Ray-Ban Meta\u2019s user interface, but the company\u2019s executives either initially didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t want to share these details with TechCrunch. We already knew Meta trains its Llama AI models on everything Americans post publicly on Instagram and Facebook. But now, Meta has expanded this definition of \u201cpublicly available data\u201d to anything people look at through its smart glasses and ask its AI chatbot to analyze.\nThis is particularly relevant now. On Wednesday, Meta started rolling out new AI features that make it easier for Ray-Ban Meta users to invoke Meta AI in more natural way, meaning users will be more likely to send it new data that can also be used for training. In addition, the company announced a new live video analysis feature for Ray-Ban Meta during its 2024 Connect conference last week, which essentially sends a continuous stream of images into Meta\u2019s multimodal AI models. In a promotional video, Meta said you could use the feature to look around your closet, analyze the whole thing with AI, and pick out an outfit.\nWhat the company doesn\u2019t promote is that you are also sending these images to Meta for model training.\nMeta spokespeople pointed TechCrunch towards its privacy policy, which plainly states: \u201cyour interactions with AI features can be used to train AI models.\u201d This seems to include images shared with Meta AI through the Ray-Bans smart glasses, but Meta still wouldn\u2019t clarify.\nSpokespeople also pointed TechCrunch towards Meta AI\u2019s terms of service, which states that by sharing images with Meta AI, \u201cyou agree that Meta will analyze those images, including facial features, using AI.\u201d\nMeta just paid the state of Texas $1.4 billion to settle a court case related to the company\u2019s use of facial recognition software. That case was over a Facebook feature rolled out in 2011 called \u201cTag Suggestions.\u201d By 2021, Facebook made the feature explicitly opt-in, and deleted billions of people\u2019s biometric information it had collected. Notably, several of Meta AI\u2019s image features are not being released in Texas.\nElsewhere in Meta\u2019s privacy polices, the company states that it also stores all the transcriptions of your voice conversations with Ray-Ban Meta, by default, to train future AI models. As for the actual voice recordings, there is a way to opt-out. When you first login to the Ray-Ban Meta app, users can choose whether voice recordings can be used to train Meta\u2019s AI models.\nIt\u2019s clear that Meta, Snap, and other tech companies are pushing for smart glasses as a new computing form factor. All of these devices feature cameras that people wear on their face, and they\u2019re mostly powered by AI. This rehashes a ton of privacy concerns we first heard about in the Google Glass era. 404 Media reported that some college students have already hacked the Ray-Ban Meta glasses to reveal the name, address, and phone number of anyone they look at.\n\ntitle4:\nWP Engine sues Automattic and WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg\ndescription4:\nHosting provider WP Engine has filed a lawsuit against Automattic and WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg, accusing them of extortion and abuse of power. The lawsuit comes after nearly two weeks of tussling between Mullenweg, who is also CEO of Automattic, and WP Engine over trademark infringement and contributing to the WordPress community.\nWP Engine accused Automattic and Mullenweg of not keeping promises to run WordPress open-source projects without any constraints and giving developers the freedom to build, run, modify, and redistribute the software.\n\u201cMatt Mullenweg\u2019s conduct over the last ten days has exposed significant conflicts of interest and governance issues that, if left unchecked, threaten to destroy that trust. WP Engine has no choice but to pursue these claims to protect its people, agency partners, customers, and the broader WordPress community,\u201d the company added.\nThe case document, filed in a court in California, also accused Mullenweg of having a \u201clong history of\nobfuscating the true facts\u201d about his control of WordPress Foundation and WordPress.org\nThe story until now\nFor over a week, Mullenweg has criticized WP Engine for infringing WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks. He called them the \u201cCancer of WordPress\u201d and also called out WP Engine\u2019s private equity partner, Silver Lake, for not caring about the open-source community. Later, WP Engine sent a cease-and-desist letter asking Mullenweg and Automattic to withdraw these comments. Automattic sent its own cease-and-desist letter alleging WP Engine of infringing WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks.\nNotably, Mullenweg then banned WP Engine on September 25 from accessing WordPress.org resources, including plug-ins and themes, preventing sites from updating them. Two days later, Mullenweg provided a temporary reprieve and unblocked WP Engine until October 1.\nOn Wednesday, Automattic published a proposed seven-year term sheet that it sent to WP Engine on September 20, which asks the hosting company to pay 8% of its gross revenues as a royalty fee on a monthly basis for using WordPress and WooCommerce trademarks.\nAlternatively, WP Engine could also commit 8% by deploying employees to contribute to WordPress\u2019s core features and functionalities or combination of both hours and money.\nWP Engine didn\u2019t accept these terms, which included a probation on forking plugins and extension from Automattic and WooCommerce.\nYou can contact this reporter at im@ivanmehta.com or on Signal: @ivan.42\"\n\nResponse:",
