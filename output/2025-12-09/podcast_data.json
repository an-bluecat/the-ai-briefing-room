Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas.

Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

It would also be a bit of a reversal for SpaceX, which previously considered spinning off its Starlink division for an IPO, while keeping the main company private.\nBloomberg\u2019s report comes just a few days after The Information was first to report that Elon Musk\u2019s space company was targeting a late 2026 IPO.\nThe Wall Street Journal also recently broke the news that SpaceX was engaged in another secondary share sale for employees that would peg the company\u2019s current valuation at around $800 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s report says SpaceX has \u201cfirmed up\u201d that share sale in recent days and the valuation is above the $800 billion figure, with employees being allowed to sell around $2 billion worth of shares at $420 per share.\nThis story has been corrected to have $1.5T in the headline, not $1.5B.\n\ntitle2:\nFord and Renault team up on cheaper EVs in a 'fight for our lives'\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nFord CEO Jim Farley acknowledged the automaker is in \u201ca fight for our lives in our industry\u201d as it seeks to remain competitive in Europe amid pressure from Chinese competitors. One of its weapons to stave off those threats is a partnership with French automaker Renault Group.\nThe two automakers announced an agreement Tuesday to bring two affordable Ford-branded electric vehicles to the European market in 2028. Ford will lead the design and Renault will assemble the vehicles at its factory in northern France. The EVs will be built on Renault\u2019s technology platform known as Ampere.\nThe companies have also agreed to \u201cexplore\u201d making light commercial vehicles together.\nThe partnership is part of what Ford has described as the next phase of its European transformation \u2014 a plan that aims to make the U.S. automaker more agile and cost-efficient in a market teeming with cheaper Chinese vehicles from companies like BYD and SAIC Motor.\n\u201cAs an American company, we see Europe as the frontline in the global transformation of our industry,\u201d said Farley in a statement. \u201cHow we compete here \u2014 how we innovate, partner, and invest \u2014 will write the playbook for the next generation. We are committed to a vibrant future in Europe, but that future requires us to move with greater speed and efficiency than ever before.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nFal nabs $140M in fresh funding led by Sequoia, tripling valuation to $4.5B\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nFal, a startup that hosts image, video, and audio AI models for developers, has announced that it raised a $140 million Series D led by Sequoia, with participation from Kleiner Perkins, Nvidia, and other existing investors. Its existing investors include Andreessen Horowitz, among others.\nThe round, which was Fal\u2019s third fundraise this year, valued the company at $4.5 billion, about three times what the company was worth when it raised its $125 million Series C in July, Bloomberg reported.\nTechCrunch reported in October that Fal raised a new round from investors, including Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins at a valuation of over $4 billion. We also reported at the time that the raise was around $250 million, according to our sources. This higher amount reflects the $140 million capital raised from the company and a secondary sale where existing investors sold shares, people familiar with the deal tell TechCrunch.\nFal provides the infrastructure layer for multimodal AI for customers, including Adobe, Shopify, Canva, and Quora. Founded in 2021 by Burkay Gur (a former Coinbase machine learning leader) and Gorkem Yurtseven (an ex-Amazon developer), the company has already surpassed $200 million in revenue as of October, Bloomberg reported.\"\n\nResponse:",
