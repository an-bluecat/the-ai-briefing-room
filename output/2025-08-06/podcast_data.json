Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The $500 billion commitment includes opening a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers that support Apple Intelligence, producing Apple TV+ productions in 20 U.S. states, and working with U.S. suppliers.\nThe news comes as President Trump has threatened the iPhone maker with tariffs unless it moves more of its manufacturing from Asia to the United States.\nApple, which mainly manufactures its devices in India, China, and Vietnam, has already been affected by tariffs. The company incurred $800 million in tariff-related costs during June and expects to spend $1.1 billion in the next quarter, CEO Tim Cook said during an earnings call last month.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle denies AI search features are killing website traffic\ndescription1:\nNumerous studies indicate that the shift to AI search features and the use of AI chatbots are killing traffic to publishers\u2019 sites. But Google on Wednesday denied that\u2019s the case, at least in aggregate. Instead, the search giant says that total organic click volume from its search engine to websites has been \u201crelatively stable\u201d year-over-year and that average click quality has slightly increased.\n\u201cThis data is in contrast to third-party reports that inaccurately suggest dramatic declines in aggregate traffic \u2014 often based on flawed methodologies, isolated examples, or traffic changes that occurred prior to the roll out of AI features in Search,\u201d writes Google VP and Head of Search, Liz Reid, in a new blog post.\nThough Google hasn\u2019t shared any specific data to back up its conclusions, even if we assume Google\u2019s claims to be true, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that AI isn\u2019t having an impact.\nEven Google has to admit this, as Reid acknowledges that \u201cuser trends are shifting traffic to different sites, resulting in decreased traffic to some sites and increased traffic to others.\u201d\nThat word \u201csome\u201d is doing heavy lifting here, as Google doesn\u2019t share data about how many sites are gaining or losing. And while chatbots like ChatGPT have certainly seen traffic increase in recent months, that doesn\u2019t mean online publishers aren\u2019t suffering.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle has been revamping its search engine for years to answer more questions directly on the search results page, and now does so with AI through its \u201cAI Overviews\u201d that appear at the top of search results. Google also allows users to interact with an AI chatbot for some queries. Yet Google denies that this is significantly reshaping the search landscape. Rather, it points to users shifting their attention to other sites to start their queries.\nReid explains, \u201cPeople are increasingly seeking out and clicking on sites with forums, videos, podcasts, and posts where they can hear authentic voices and first-hand perspectives.\u201d\nReading between the lines, it seems like Google.com isn\u2019t necessarily people\u2019s first stop on the web these days. But that\u2019s something we\u2019ve known for some time. Back in 2022, a Google exec even said that social sites like TikTok and Instagram were eating into Google\u2019s core products, like Search and Maps.\n\u201cIn our studies, something like almost 40% of young people, when they\u2019re looking for a place for lunch, they don\u2019t go to Google Maps or Search,\u201d said Google SVP Prabhakar Raghavan, who ran the company\u2019s Knowledge and Information organization at the time (he is now its chief technologist). \u201cThey go to TikTok or Instagram,\u201d he noted.\nGoogle has also long been worried that Amazon.com had become people\u2019s first stop for online shopping searches, and Reddit.com had become the first stop for researching topics of interest.\nOver many years, the company has tried to come up with compelling features for both consumers and retailers that would attract more users to Google Shopping. These efforts have included universal shopping carts, local inventory checks, deal finders, shopping from product images on websites, and more. It even made its Shopping listings free for merchants in 2020.\nMeanwhile, as users complained that Google Search quality was declining, the search giant was seeing so much demand for Reddit that it finally added a \u201cReddit\u201d filter to allow users to narrow down results on relevant search queries. (Now that filter simply reads \u201cforums.\u201d)\nSo perhaps there\u2019s some truth in Google\u2019s denials \u2014 it\u2019s not AI that\u2019s entirely responsible for killing search. Search was already dying.\nImage Credits:Smith Collection/Gado / Getty Images\nGoogle\u2019s new blog post also attempts to move the goalposts a bit about what it means for websites receiving Google\u2019s clicks. Now, instead of counting clicks, it wants publishers to think about click quality.\nThe company says average click quality has increased, and Google is sending \u201cslightly more quality clicks\u201d to websites than a year ago. (Google explains that a quality click is one where users don\u2019t quickly click back \u2014 they stay and read.) How much of an increase, though, Google doesn\u2019t say. The company only points out that when people click through on an AI response to the source, they\u2019re more likely to dive deeper, so those clicks are more valuable.\nWhat\u2019s more, Google paints AI as an opportunity for web publishers to gain increased exposure, saying that \u201cwith AI Overviews, people are seeing more links on the page than before,\u201d Reid writes. \u201cMore queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked.\u201d\nBut AI, while a growing referral source, isn\u2019t yet making up the difference in terms of clicks, reports have shown. One recent study from Similarweb indicates that the number of news searches on the web resulting in zero clicks to news websites has grown from 56% (when Google launched AI Overviews in May 2024) to 69% as of May 2025.\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nGoogle appears to knows this is a trend, too, as it recently launched a product for publishers that helps them monetize their dwindling traffic in other ways that don\u2019t rely only on advertising, like micropayments or newsletter sign-ups.\nThe fact that Google is pushing this \u201cAI is not the end of search traffic!\u201d PR now only makes the situation seem more dire. It\u2019s as if Google wants publishers to believe not what their own eyes \u2014 and graphs and charts \u2014 tell them, but instead take comfort in the fact that Google still sends \u201cbillions of clicks to websites\u201d every day, just as the post claims.\n\ntitle2:\nUpwork is buying its way into corporate staffing beyond freelancers\ndescription2:\nUpwork, a platform that connects companies with freelancers, announced two acquisitions to help build out a new stand-alone enterprise-focused business that could expand its market reach.\nThe San Francisco-based company announced it has acquired Bubty, a workforce management platform, and has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ascen, a global compliance and EOR (employer of record) company, ahead of its second-quarter earnings call on August 6.\nUpwork will integrate these two companies into its existing enterprise business to create a stand-alone entity under the Upwork umbrella.\nThe move is significant because it will allow Upwork to offer access to talent beyond the independent contractor workforce Upwork is known for \u2014 essentially enabling the company to compete in new areas of the corporate staffing market. The new entity will support contract types, including agent of record, employer of record, and staff augmentation.\nUpwork president and CEO Hayden Brown told TechCrunch that the timing was right to launch this new enterprise-focused business because Upwork\u2019s existing enterprise customers have been increasingly asking for access to these talent pools.\n\u201cMost of the providers that exist today force their customers to choose between flexibility and compliance, or speed and scale, or having a digital tool versus having something that\u2019s actually robust and for the enterprise,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd with this new capability, we\u2019re refusing to compromise. We\u2019re giving our customers all of the benefits they\u2019ve been looking for, and we\u2019ve heard loud and clear that they want this singular solution.\u201d\nBrown said that Upwork\u2019s existing enterprise business makes up about $100 million of the company\u2019s overall $750 million in yearly revenue.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nUpwork decided to make the enterprise business a stand-alone entity because enterprises have very different needs regarding compliance and software integrations than the small and midsize businesses Upwork\u2019s main business works with.\nKeeping them separate allows for better external branding and better internal focus, Brown said.\nUpwork vetted more than 100 potential companies to acquire to build out this business, Brown said. The company landed on Bubty and Ascen not only for what they bring separately but also for how they worked together \u2014 Upwork piloted the companies both individually and together.\n\u201cWe saw through the power of those pilots how impactful their technology was and how easy it was to basically snap together what each of them offers, along with our existing offering to deliver something very new and innovative in the market,\u201d Brown added.\nDetails on the branding and full offerings of the new stand-alone business are set to be unveiled later this year.\n\ntitle3:\nFederal regulators give Zoox an exemption for its custom-built robotaxis\ndescription3:\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given Zoox an exemption to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads and closed a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.\nThe decision, which was announced Wednesday, clears up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox\u2019s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, which place requirements on vehicles such as having a steering wheel and pedals. Zoox had argued that it did and announced in July 2022 that it had self-certified; NHTSA balked. The agency opened an investigation in March 2023 to look into the matter, and specifically the process and data that Zoox had used to self-certify.\nThe investigation didn\u2019t slow Zoox\u2019s development and testing of its autonomous vehicle technology. In early 2023, Zoox began testing its custom-built robotaxis, which don\u2019t have a steering wheel or other traditional controls, on public roads near its Foster City, California headquarters. The company has since expanded its testing footprint to Las Vegas and San Francisco.\nZoox does not operate a commercial service yet. However, in San Francisco it has opened its robotaxis up to employees and hosted family and friends. Earlier this year, the company launched an Zoox Explorer program, aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas.\nFor now, the exemption allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially.\nNHTSA\u2019s announcement is connected to its new national framework, which the agency argues will make it easier for companies to deploy autonomous vehicles without traditional manual driving controls \u2014 like steering wheels, pedals, and sideview mirrors \u2014 at scale.\nThe framework, known as AV STEP (or ADS-Equipped Vehicle Safety, Transparency and Evaluation Program), allows NHTSA to green-light the sale and commercialization of autonomous vehicles that are not compliant with federal safety standards due to a lack of manual controls.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe revised process involves an expedited application that allows companies like Zoox to receive exemptions for testing and demonstrations, and eventually, commercial operations. Zoox spokesperson Whitney Jencks said in an email that Zoox is working in close cooperation with NHTSA on this process, beginning with the demonstration exemption and followed by the commercial exemption.\nAs part of the agreement, NHTSA has closed its investigation into Zoox\u2019s self-certification of its AVs. Zoox has agreed to remove or cover all statements that its purpose-built vehicles comply with applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle takes on ChatGPT's Study Mode with new 'Guided Learning' tool in Gemini\ndescription4:\nAs the new school year approaches, Google announced on Wednesday that it\u2019s launching a new tool called Guided Learning within Gemini. The tool sort of functions like an AI tutor, as it\u2019s designed to help users build a deep understanding instead of just getting answers.\nThe launch follows just over a week after OpenAI rolled out Study Mode for ChatGPT, which is also designed to go beyond simply obtaining answers to questions by actually helping users develop critical thinking skills.\nBoth companies\u2019 launches come amid concerns that AI chatbots undermine the learning process because they spit out direct answers. The new tools from Google and OpenAI likely aim to address these concerns by positioning their chatbots as learning tools rather than simple answer engines.\nWith Guided Learning, Gemini will break down problems step-by-step and adapt explanations to its users\u2019 needs. The feature responds using images, diagrams, videos, and interactive quizzes to help users build and test themselves on their knowledge, rather than simply giving them the answer.\nImage Credits:Google\nGoogle says the feature will help users uncover the \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201chow\u201d behind concepts.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re preparing for an exam about enzymes, starting the first draft of a paper on the importance of bee populations in supporting our food systems, or exploring your passion for photography, Guided Learning is a collaborative thinking partner that helps you get it \u2014 each step of the way,\u201d wrote Maureen Heymans, Google\u2019s VP of Learning & Sustainability, in the blog post.\nIn addition to the new feature, Google announced that it\u2019s working to make Gemini as a whole better equipped to help users learn. Gemini will now automatically incorporate images, diagrams, and YouTube videos directly into responses to help users better understand complex topics. Plus, users can now also ask Gemini to create flashcards and study guides based on their quiz results or other class materials.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
