Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

And this year, the statistic is 80%.\u201d\nThe round was co-led by Thrive (Ghodsi counts Thrive\u2019s founder Joshua Kushner as a personal friend) and one of Databricks\u2019 early investors, Insight Partners. The firms co-led the previous $10 billion, too.\nInsight Partners managing director John Wolff tells TechCrunch in an emailed statement that it has seen firsthand how Databricks marched to $4 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\u201cWe have seen many of our portfolio companies adopt Databricks,\u201d Wolff said.\n\ntitle1:\nNetskope follows Rubrik as a rare cybersecurity IPO, both backed by Lightspeed\ndescription1:\nCybersecurity is a massive sector, but startups in the category are more likely to be acquired than go public. Even Wiz, which for a time held the title of the fastest-growing startup, abandoned its IPO ambitions when it agreed to sell to Google earlier this year.\nIn the past few years, there have been scant few significant cybersecurity debuts such as SentinelOne in 2021, and Rubrik last year.\nNext week, the sector is expected to add one more public company: the cloud cybersecurity platform Netskope. The 13-year-old startup also shares its earliest and largest investor with Rubrik: Lightspeed Venture Partners.\nThe large Silicon Valley firm had a 23.9% ownership of Rubrik when it went public at $6.6 billion last year. In the case of Netskope, Lightspeed owns 19.3% of the company that aims to achieve a valuation of as much as $6.5 billion, according to the updated S1 filing.\nLightspeed first backed Netskope in 2013, leading the company\u2019s $21 million Series B.\nThe company set its IPO price between $15 and $17 per share, and at the upper end of that range, giving Lightspeed an approximately $1.1 billion windfall, in terms of the value of its stake.\nNetskope\u2019s other major investors include ICONIQ Growth, which holds 19.2% of the company\u2019s stock, followed by Accel with a stake of nearly 9%.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nNetskope is known as a Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) provider. It offers cybersecurity for an enterprise\u2019s cloud infrastructure, with such products as secure web gateways and firewall as a service. The company\u2019s main competitors are Zscaler and Palo Alto Networks.\nThe company was last valued at $7.5 billion, when it raised a $300 million Series H led by ICONIQ Growth in 2021, the height of the ZIRP era. It also took on a $401 million convertible note in 2023.\nBut those capital infusions weren\u2019t enough to get Netskope to profitability. For the first half of the year, Netskope\u2019s revenue grew to $328.5 million from $251.3 million a year ago. During that time, its net loss narrowed to $169.5 million from $206.7 million, the filing shows.\nIf Netskope goes public at a valuation of $6.5 billion, the company would be among a number of VC-backed companies that have recently debuted below their final private market valuation.\nOther companies that went public below their latest private valuations include Chime and Hinge Health. But not all new listings are being met with caution. Some recent IPOs, like Figma and Circle, have soared on the first day of trading.\n\ntitle2:\nCognition AI defies turbulence with a $400M raise at $10.2B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nCognition AI, the startup behind AI coding agent Devin, has hit a $10.2 billion valuation after raising $400 million, marking a jump from the company\u2019s $4 billion valuation earlier this year, reports Bloomberg.\nFounders Fund, the Peter Thiel-backed VC, led Cognition\u2019s latest round, with participation from existing investors like Lux Capital, Joe Lonsdale\u2019s 8VC, Elad Gil, Definition Capital and Swish Ventures.\nIn July, Cognition acquired AI coding startup Windsurf, just days after Google poached the startup\u2019s CEO, co-founder, and research leads.\nThe raise comes after serious growth for Cognition\u2019s core product. The startup\u2019s annual recurring revenue from Devin has climbed to $73 million in June, up from $1 million in September 2024. Net burn has remained under $20 million since its founding two years ago, per Bloomberg.\nAt the same time, the company has built a reputation for placing strict demands on its workers. Last month, Cognition laid off 30 staffers and offered buyouts to the remaining 200 employees, offering them a way out of the expectation to work 80-hour, six-day weeks.\n\ntitle3:\nIntel's chief executive of products departs among other leadership changes\ndescription3:\nSemiconductor giant Intel continues to shake up its senior leadership since Lip-Bu Tan took the helm as CEO in March.\nIntel announced Monday that Michelle Johnston Holthaus will depart the company after more than three decades. Johnston Holthhaus was most recently chief executive officer of Intel products and will remain a strategic adviser.\nThe company also announced the creation of a central engineering group that will build a new custom silicon business for outside customers, according to Intel. This group will be helmed by Srinivasan \u201cSrini\u201d Iyengar who joined Intel from Cadence Design Systems in July.\nIntel also said that Kevok Kechichian, formerly of ARM, will join the company as head of its data center group. Jim Johnson has been appointed senior vice president and general manager of Intel\u2019s client computing group. Naga Chandrasekaran, the chief technology and operations officer of Intel Foundry, the company\u2019s business unit that builds custom chips for outside customers, is also taking on an expanded role.\n\u201cWith Srini leading Central Engineering, we\u2019re aligning innovation and execution more tightly in service to customers,\u201d Tan said in a company press release. \u201cWe are laser-focused on delivering world-class products and empowering our engineering teams to move faster and execute with excellence. Kevork, Jim, and Srini are exceptional leaders whose deep technical acumen and industry relationships will be instrumental as we continue building a new Intel.\u201d\nThis news comes just a few weeks after the U.S. government announced a plan to convert existing government grants into a 10% stake in Intel. The deal was structured to penalize Intel if the company dropped below 50% ownership of its foundry unit.\nThese weren\u2019t the only leadership changes at Intel this year.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

In July the company announced that it hired four new people for sales and engineering roles including Greg Ernst to serve as Intel\u2019s chief revenue officer.\nIntel declined to comment.\n\ntitle4:\nSnap breaks into 'startup squads' as ad revenue stalls\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nSnap is breaking itself apart and rebuilding from within. In a new annual company letter, CEO Evan Spiegel just announced the company is restructuring around small \u201cstartup squads\u201d of 10 to 15 people to better compete against larger competitors.\nThe move comes as the 5,000-person company faces mounting pressure. Advertising revenue growth flatlined at 4% in the second quarter, and North American daily active users declined 2% to 98 million, a troubling sign in Snap\u2019s most important market.\nSpiegel does highlight one bright spot: Snapchat+ subscriptions now generate over $700 million in annual recurring revenue from more than 15 million paying subscribers, making direct revenue \u201cone of Snap\u2019s fastest-growing opportunities.\u201d\nSnap is also doubling down on Specs, building its own AR glasses that Spiegel envisions will replace smartphones entirely. He calls them a \u201ca once-in-a-generation transformation towards human-centered computing.\u201d (Meta and Google see the same future, partnering with Ray-Ban and Warby Parker, respectively.)\nSpiegel acknowledges the current stock price \u201creflects doubt\u201d but writes that there\u2019s \u201cstartup-style return potential\u201d at Snap\u2019s roughly $12 billion valuation. Left unsaid: that number is down 90% from September 2021, when Snap\u2019s market cap topped $116 billion during the height of social media mania.\"\n\nResponse:",
