Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Then OpenAI said it would build out five more Stargate AI data centers with Oracle and SoftBank, adding gigawatts of new capacity online in the coming years. And it was later revealed that Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds to pay for these data centers.\nOn their own, each deal is dizzying in scale. But in aggregate, we see how Silicon Valley is moving heaven and earth to give OpenAI enough power to train and serve future versions of ChatGPT.\nThis week on Equity, Anthony Ha and I (Max Zeff) go beyond the headlines to break down what\u2019s really going on in these AI infrastructure deals.\nRather conveniently, OpenAI also gave the world a glimpse this week of a power-intensive feature it could serve more broadly if it had access to more AI data centers.\nThe company launched Pulse \u2014 a new feature in ChatGPT that works overnight to deliver personalized morning briefings for users. The experience feels similar to a news app or a social feed \u2014 something you check first thing in the morning \u2014 but doesn\u2019t have posts from other users or ads (yet).\nPulse is part of a new class of OpenAI products that work independently, even when users aren\u2019t in the ChatGPT app. The company would like to deliver a lot more of these features and roll them out to free users, but they\u2019re limited by the number of computer servers available to them. OpenAI said it can only offer Pulse to its $200-a-month Pro subscribers right now due to capacity constraints.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The feature looks cool and all, but that\u2019s a tall order.\nWatch the full episode to hear more about the massive AI infrastructure investments reshaping Silicon Valley, TikTok\u2019s ownership saga, and the policy changes affecting tech\u2019s biggest players.\n\ntitle2:\nYouTube Music tests AI hosts that share trivia and commentary\ndescription2:\nYouTube Music is testing AI music hosts that provide relevant stories, fan trivia, and commentary about what you\u2019re listening to, the company announced on Friday.\nThe move comes two years after Spotify launched an AI DJ that delivers a curated selection of music alongside AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists you like.\nYouTube Music\u2019s new feature builds on its ongoing experiments with conversational AI. In July, the service rolled out an AI conversational radio feature that lets users create a custom radio station by describing what they want to hear.\nYouTube Music\u2019s new AI hosts are currently being tested through YouTube Labs, the platform\u2019s new hub for AI experiments. In a blog post, the company said YouTube Labs is \u201ca new initiative dedicated to exploring the potential of AI on YouTube.\u201d\nYouTube Labs is similar to Google Labs, Google\u2019s experimental arm that lets users test early-stage AI products and provide feedback.\nYouTube Labs is open to all YouTube users, which means they don\u2019t need a Premium membership to sign up. However, the company notes that only a limited number of U.S.-based participants will be given access to the experimental program.\nYouTube Labs has been implementing AI features across YouTube recently.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nEarlier this month, the company released a series of AI features for creators, including GenAI tools for Shorts creation. A few months ago, YouTube launched an AI-powered search results carousel similar to Google\u2019s AI Overviews and expanded access to its conversational AI tool to help users find more information, receive content recommendations, and get video summaries.\nWhile YouTube is embracing AI features, it\u2019s also cracking down on AI slop. The platform recently updated its policies to crack down on creators\u2019 ability to generate revenue from \u201cinauthentic\u201d content, including mass-produced videos and other types of repetitive content.\n\ntitle4:\n'The Social Network' sequel will focus on Haugen leaks, with Jeremy Strong as Mark Zuckerberg\ndescription4:\nFifteen years after \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d Aaron Sorkin will write and direct a sequel film called \u201cThe Social Reckoning,\u201d set for release on October 9, 2026.\nJesse Eisenberg will not reprise his breakout role as Mark Zuckerberg, but instead will be replaced with the more sallow, serious Jeremy Strong.\nBest known for playing Kendall Roy in \u201cSuccession,\u201d Strong is known for his method acting, a technique in which the actor tries to immerse themselves in the mental and emotional state of the character\u2026 so if Strong suddenly takes up MMA fighting and gets really excited about a social metaverse that no one wants, then we\u2019ll know that filming is imminent.\nThis film won\u2019t pick up directly where \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d which chronicled the rise of Facebook, left off. Instead, the story centers around Frances Haugen (played by Mikey Madison), the former Facebook employee who leaked a massive trove of internal documents to a Wall Street Journal reporter (played by Jeremy Allen White) and accused the company of prioritizing \u201cprofits over people\u201d in 2021.\nAmong the most damning revelations from Haugen\u2019s leak was internal research showing that the company was well aware that Instagram was harming the mental health of teenage girls. Haugen said in congressional testimony that Facebook was \u201cliterally fanning ethnic violence\u201d in Ethiopia, since content moderation efforts in non-English languages were under-resourced. Her leaked documents also revealed that 87% of Meta\u2019s spending on reducing misinformation went toward English language content, though English speakers make up just 9% of users.\nZuckerberg and Facebook \u2014 rebranded to Meta shortly after Haugen\u2019s leaks \u2014 have always rankled at how \u201cThe Social Network\u201d depicts the company\u2019s origin. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg revealed in an interview that he saw the movie one time as part of an outing with other Facebook employees, which was arranged because he knew that they would go see the movie anyway.\n\u201cIt was weird, man,\u201d he said. \u201cThey got all these very specific details of what I was wearing, or these specific things correct, but then the whole narrative arc around my motivations and all this stuff were like, completely wrong.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
