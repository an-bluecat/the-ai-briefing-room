Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday January 23), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft 365 hit by outage, preventing access to emails and files\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nAn ongoing Microsoft outage is preventing enterprise customers from accessing email inboxes, files, meetings, and other Microsoft cloud services.\nThe technology giant said in a post on X around 2:30 p.m. ET that the outage was caused by a \u201cportion of service infrastructure in North America that is not processing traffic as expected.\u201d Microsoft didn\u2019t provide specific details of the cause of the outage, but said it was \u201cworking to restore the infrastructure to a healthy state to achieve recovery.\u201d\nMicrosoft said on its status page that the outage affects its Exchange Online email service, searching files within SharePoint Online or OneDrive, and creating chats, meetings, or adding members in its video meeting platform, Teams.\nThe outage also prevents admins from accessing their Microsoft Purview and Defender XDR security dashboards and their admin centers.\nWe\u2019ll reach out to Microsoft for comment \u2014 as soon as our email, which is hosted by Microsoft, returns to normal.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla launches robotaxi rides in Austin with no human safety driver\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nTesla is offering passengers robotaxi rides in Austin without a human safety driver in the front seat.\nCEO Elon Musk on Thursday posted on X, his social media platform: \u201cJust started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car. Congrats to the Tesla AI team!\u201d\nHe then made a recruitment pitch for engineers interested in \u201csolving real-world AI,\u201d which he says will \u201clikely lead to AGI\u201d to join the Tesla AI team.\nThe automaker launched its robotaxis in the Texas city last June in a limited deployment with a safety operator in the front passenger seat. Tesla initially offered those first rides to influencers and handpicked customers. In December, Tesla began testing its robotaxis in Austin without a safety driver in the front seat \u2014 a precaution in case the vehicle needs a human to take over.\nNot all of Tesla\u2019s fleet in Austin will be fully driverless. Per Tesla\u2019s AI lead Ashok Elluswamy, the company will be \u201cstarting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time.\u201d\nTesla is charging for the rides, according to one rider who posted on X. There also appears to be a chase car following the driverless vehicles.\nSome of Tesla\u2019s rivals, like Zoox and Waymo, did not immediately charge for driverless rides upon initial deployment.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nTechCrunch has attempted to reach out to Tesla for clarification.\nThe article has been updated to reflect new information, including that Tesla is charging for the rides.\n\ntitle3:\nFormer Sequoia partner\u2019s new startup uses AI to negotiate your calendar for you\ndescription3:\nKais Khimji has spent most of his professional career as a venture investor, including six years as a partner at the prominent VC firm Sequoia Capital.\nBut just like several other former Sequoia partners \u2014 including David V\u00e9lez, who founded the Brazilian digital bank Nubank \u2014 Khimji (pictured left) has always wanted to be a startup founder. On Thursday, he announced that he has revived an idea he began working on as a student at Harvard about 10 years ago, turning it into the AI calendar-scheduling company Blockit. In a major vote of confidence, Khimji\u2019s former employer, Sequoia, led the company\u2019s $5 million seed round.\n\u201cBlockit has a chance to become a $1Bn+ revenue business, and Kais will make sure it gets there,\u201d Pat Grady, Sequoia\u2019s general partner and co-steward who led the investment, wrote in a blog post.\nWhile many startups have tried to automate scheduling in the past, Khimji believes that thanks to advances in LLMs, Blockit\u2019s AI agents can handle scheduling more seamlessly and efficiently than many of its predecessors, including now-defunct startups Clara Labs and x.ai. (Yes, that domain name ended up with Elon Musk\u2019s AI company.)\nUnlike the current category leader Calendly, which was last valued at $3 billion and relies on users sharing links to find availability, Blockit is betting that its AI agents can master the nuance required to handle the entire scheduling process without human involvement.\nWith Blockit, Khimji and co-founder John Hahn \u2014 who previously worked on calendar products, including Timeful, Google Calendar, and Clockwise \u2014 are building what is essentially an AI social network for people\u2019s time.\n\u201cIt always felt very odd. I have a time database \u2014 my calendar. You have a time database \u2014 your calendar, and our databases just can\u2019t talk to each other,\u201d Khimji told TechCrunch.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nKhimji says that Blockit can finally solve this disconnection. When two users need to meet, their respective AI agents communicate directly to negotiate a time, bypassing the typical back-and-forth emails entirely.\nUsers can invoke the Blockit agent by copying it on an email or messaging it in Slack about a meeting. The bot then takes over the logistics, negotiating a mutually convenient time and location that fits the preferences of all participants.\nKhimji said that Blockit can work as seamlessly as a human executive assistant. Users simply need to provide the system with specific instructions about their preferences, such as which meetings are nonnegotiable and which are \u201cmovable\u201d based on daily needs. \u201cSometimes my calendar is crazy, so I need to skip lunch, and the agent needs to know that it\u2019s okay to skip lunch,\u201d he said.\nThe system can even be trained to prioritize meetings based on the tone of an email. For instance, a user might instruct the agent that a meeting request signed with a formal \u201cBest regards\u201d should take precedence over a casual interaction ending with \u201cCheers.\u201d\nBy learning the preferences of its users, Blockit appears to be capitalizing on what venture firm Foundation Capital\u2019s partners Jaya Gupta and Ashu Garg call \u201ccontext graphs.\u201d In a widely shared essay, the investors describe a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AI agents to capture the \u201cwhy\u201d behind every business decision by relying on the hidden logic that previously only existed in a person\u2019s head.\nBlockit is already being used by more than 200 companies, including AI startup Together.ai, the newly acquired fintech company Brex, and robotics startup Rogo, as well as venture firms a16z, Accel, and Index. The app is available for free for 30 days. After that, it costs $1,000 annually for individual users and $5,000 annually for a team license with support for multiple users, Khimji said.\n\ntitle4:\nGM to end Chevy Bolt EV production next year, move China-made Buick to US factory\ndescription4:\nGeneral Motors is shuffling where its vehicles are made in a move that will shift production away from China and Mexico and to a U.S. factory in Kansas. That change will also mean the end of its rebooted Chevrolet Bolt EV, the only vehicle currently built at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas.\nThe factory musical chairs reflect an economic and political environment, shaped by the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policy and its decision to end the federal EV tax credit, which provided up to $7,500 off qualifying electric vehicles. These changes have made it more expensive to build vehicles in China and Mexico that are then sold in the United States.\nProduction of the 2027 Chevy Bolt EV, which landed in dealerships this month, is expected to end in about a year and a half. The new Chevy Bolt EV, which is priced at $29,990 including the destination fee, is one of the most affordable new EVs available to U.S. consumers.\nGM confirmed to TechCrunch that the next-generation Buick Envision, currently built in China, will move to the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas, beginning in 2028. The gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox, which is made in the San Luis Potos\u00ed plant in Mexico, will move to the Kansas factory in mid-2027.\nThe Bolt, meanwhile, will have a short life if GM follows through with its previously announced plans.\n\u201cWhen we revealed Bolt in October, we said and it was widely reported that it\u2019d be a limited run model,\u201d a GM spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. \u201cWe had also previously announced the gas-powered Equinox would be coming to Fairfax in mid 2027 after Bolt production ramps down. Today we\u2019re announcing the next-generation Buick compact SUV will come to Fairfax beginning in 2028.\u201d\nThe company still sells other EVs, including an electric Chevy Equinox and Chevy Blazer. The question is whether GM will change course and save the Bolt if sales are better than expected. We do know that GM has promised to make new future investments in Fairfax Assembly for its next generation of affordable EVs. We just don\u2019t know when.\"\n\nResponse:",
