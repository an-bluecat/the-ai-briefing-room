Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

At the time, Amazon said that Alexa+ would roll out in waves over the coming months.\nAmazon\u2019s new digital assistant aims to let users talk with it in a more natural style, and eventually have agentic abilities that allow it to use third-party apps on a user\u2019s behalf. Alexa+ should be able to generate original responses on the fly, much like the voice modes in OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini, rather than the predetermined responses of the old Alexa and Siri systems.\nHowever, as The Washington Post reported at launch, the Alexa+ that\u2019s rolling out today lacks some of the key features the company demoed in February. The report notes that, at launch, Alexa+ did not have the ability to use third party apps like GrubHub, generate a bedtime story for children, or brainstorm a gift idea. It\u2019s unclear when those features will make it into Alexa+.\n\u201cWe have a lot more functionality that we plan to add in coming months,\u201d Jassy said on the call.\nDuring his opening comments, Jassy claimed that Alexa+ is one of the first action-oriented AI agents for consumers. But he noted that this technology is still rather \u201cprimitive\u201d and \u201cinaccurate.\u201d Currently, most multi-step AI agents have a low accuracy rate, between 30% and 60%, the Amazon CEO said. Jassy set a goal for the company\u2019s web-browsing agent that powers Alexa+, Nova Act, to achieve 90% accuracy in this domain.\nAmazon\u2019s rollout of Alexa+ seems to be progressing faster than Apple\u2019s rollout of its new, LLM-powered Siri. When asked about the new Siri delays on Apple\u2019s Thursday earnings call, which occurred simultaneously wiith Amazon\u2019s, CEO Tim Cook said the company needed \u201cmore time to complete the work.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nAlong the road to supercharge legacy digital assistants with generative AI, both Apple and Amazon have reportedly run into snags and delays. Some of the biggest hiccups are around getting LLMs to use tools and integrate with other systems. Doing so allows Alexa and Siri to complete practical tasks such as setting timers and reading texts, but implementing it has proven harder than expected.\n\ntitle1:\nApple CEO Tim Cook says tariffs to add $900M in costs in Q3, but future uncertain\ndescription1:\nApple CEO Tim Cook offered the company\u2019s first comments on the impact of President Trump\u2019s tariffs during Thursday\u2019s second-quarter earnings call with investors. While the iPhone maker saw only \u201climited impact\u201d from tariffs in the March quarter, Cook said Apple couldn\u2019t forecast what that would mean for the coming quarter. However, if things remained the same, the company estimates tariffs will only add $900 million to its costs in Q3.\nThe news was a relief to investors, with one even calling it a \u201cpretty good outcome.\u201d However, investors were still concerned as to what the next quarters could hold, given the rapid changes to U.S. trade policy in recent weeks.\nCook told investors Apple\u2019s estimate was meant to provide some color and would only hold if the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications didn\u2019t change for the balance of the quarter and if no new tariffs were added.\nHe also warned that this estimate shouldn\u2019t be used to project the impact of tariffs in future quarters, as there are \u201cunique factors\u201d that benefit the June quarter.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Cook had downplayed the impact of tariffs, noting that Apple is already sourcing about half its iPhones for the U.S. from India, and most other products for the U.S. market from Vietnam.\nWhen pressed by one investor to offer more details on the June quarter and beyond, Cook said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to predict the future, because I\u2019m not sure what will happen with the tariffs.\u201d\nCook added that he wouldn\u2019t want to predict the mix of production in the future, but noted that he was very engaged with the tariff discussions. (That much was already clear. Shortly after a meeting with President Trump, Apple\u2019s iPhones were spared from the trade policy changes that could have sent iPhone pricing soaring.)\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\n\u201cFor our part, we will manage the company the way we always have, with thoughtful and deliberate decisions, with a focus on investing for the long term, and with dedication to innovation and the possibilities it creates,\u201d Cook said. \u201cAs we look ahead, we remain confident, confident that we will continue to build the world\u2019s best products and services, confident in our ability to innovate and enrich our users\u2019 lives, and confident that we can continue to run our business in a way that has always set Apple apart.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia takes aim at Anthropic's support of chip export controls\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nNvidia clearly doesn\u2019t agree with Anthropic\u2019s support for export controls on U.S.-made AI chips.\nOn Wednesday, Anthropic doubled down on its support for the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s \u201cFramework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion,\u201d which would impose sweeping AI chip export restrictions starting May 15.\nThe next day, Nvidia responded with a very different take on the upcoming controls.\n\u201cAmerican firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in \u2018baby bumps\u2019 or \u2018alongside live lobsters,\u2019\u201d a spokesperson for Nvidia told CNBC, in reference to Anthropic\u2019s claims of how these AI chips are being smuggled into countries targeted by the U.S. controls, like China.\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, an Nvidia spokesperson added that \u201cChina, with half of the world\u2019s AI researchers, has highly capable AI experts at every layer of the AI stack. America cannot manipulate regulators to capture victory in AI.\u201d\nExport restrictions would hurt Nvidia\u2019s global revenue stream. Nvidia recently stated that a new licensing requirement for its H20 AI chips to be sold in China could cost the company $5.5 billion in Q1 of its 2026 fiscal year.\nThis piece has been updated to include additional commentary from Nvidia.\n\ntitle3:\nStripe shows iOS developers how to avoid Apple's App Store commission\ndescription3:\nPayments processing software provider Stripe is ready to help iOS app developers bypass Apple\u2019s cut of App Store transactions.\nFollowing yesterday\u2019s ruling in the Apple-Epic antitrust trial, where Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers outright shamed Apple for not permitting external payment links in apps as she had previously ruled, Stripe shared documentation that shows iOS developers how to avoid the Apple commission.\nIn a post on X, Stripe product manager Michael Luo said the team \u201ccooked up a quick guide\u201d that walks iOS developers through how to accept payments using Stripe outside of their apps, so they can take advantage of the new option, which was made possible by the court\u2019s decision.\nStripe \ud83e\udd1diOS developers\nBig news iOS app developers! You can now accept payments with @stripe outside of your app, with no iOS app store commissions.\nThe Stripe team \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udf73cooked up a quick guide walking you through how. Go live now!\nDocs in the \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/gKguWwBanv \u2014 Michael Luo (@AzianMike) May 1, 2025\nApple allowed developers to link to external websites to make purchases, but it only reduced its 30% commission by 3%, and added \u201cscare screens\u201d that warned consumers about the potential dangers of paying developers outside its App Store. Judge Rogers said Apple\u2019s policy didn\u2019t follow either the spirit or the letter of the law, in terms of her prior injunction, and ordered the company to change its policies immediately.\nStripe\u2019s new documentation explains how developers can set up a link inside their app to accept payments on iOS for digital goods using Stripe Checkout. The option would redirect an app\u2019s customers to a secure, Stripe-hosted payments page as a part of the new checkout experience, the company says.\nOf course, using Stripe is not as simple as taking advantage of the default option of Apple\u2019s in-app purchases, as it requires developers to set up and maintain their own payments page and checkout experience. However, Stripe\u2019s standard payment processing fees are 2.9% plus $0.30 per transaction, making it a much more affordable alternative to Apple\u2019s 30% commission (or even its 15% commission for select apps, like those in Apple\u2019s Small Biz program or subscription apps, starting in year two).\nStripe\u2019s announcement is already gaining traction, with the news getting thousands of likes on X from eager developers.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nLongtime Apple critic, David Heinemeier Hansson, who is the creator of Ruby on Rails and co-owner of 37Signals, which makes software like Basecamp and HEY, also praised Stripe\u2019s solution. Hansson, over the years, has repeatedly feuded with Apple for rejecting HEY\u2019s email and calendaring apps because they were set up to avoid using Apple\u2019s in-app purchase mechanisms.\nOn X, Hansson suggested the change to Apple\u2019s policies to now allow for external payments will make more businesses possible on the App Store.\n\u201cApple\u2019s loss in court is immediately opening up a whole new world for app developers,\u201d he says. \u201cEntire business models were impossible under the old 30% regime.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nRising star defense tech startup Mach Industries is raising $100 million, sources say\ndescription4:\nMach Industries, the defense tech founded by 21-year-old Ethan Thornton, is about to close a fresh $100 million in financing co-led by new investor Khosla and existing investor Bedrock Capital, a source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch.\nThe new round will value the company at around $470 million, according to the source. However, the deal hasn\u2019t closed and terms may still change. The Khosla investor leading the deal is Keith Rabois.\nMach Industries is a buzzy defense tech startup, a status propelled by its founding origin story and connection to Sequoia. Thornton was just a teenager when he dropped out of MIT to found Mach Industries, which was Sequoia\u2019s first defense tech investment.\nMach is developing vertical liftoff vehicles and weapons that can work from the edge of space. It is also developing smaller factories that can be easily built and distributed when more production is needed.\nIn March, Mach announced it was selected by the Army Applications Laboratory to develop a vertical takeoff precision cruise missile it calls \u201cStrategic Strike.\u201d It also announced plans for its first factory, a 115,000-square foot-facility in Huntington Beach, California.\nThis new funding should bring the startup\u2019s total funding to about $185 million, to date. Sequoia led Mach\u2019s $5.7 million seed round, which was announced in June 2023. Geoff Lewis, founder of Bedrock Capital, led Mach\u2019s $79 million Series A round a few months later.\"\n\nResponse:",
