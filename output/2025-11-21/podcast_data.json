In that earlier case, the hackers stole Drift authentication tokens from those customers, allowing the hackers to break into their linked Salesforce instances and download their contents.\nAt the time, Gainsight confirmed it was among the victims of that hacking campaign.\n\u201cGainsight was a customer of Salesloft Drift, they were affected and therefore compromised entirely by us,\u201d a spokesperson for the ShinyHunters group told TechCrunch.\nSalesforce spokesperson Nicole Aranda told TechCrunch that \u201cas a matter of policy, Salesforce does not comment on specific customer issues.\u201d\nGainsight did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s requests for comment.\nOn Thursday, Salesforce said there is \u201cno indication that this issue resulted from any vulnerability in the Salesforce platform,\u201d effectively distancing itself from its customers\u2019 data breaches.\nGainsight has been publishing updates about the incident on its incident page. On Friday, the company said that it is now working with Google\u2019s incident response unit Mandiant to help investigate the breach, that the incident in question \u201coriginated from the applications\u2019 external connection \u2014 not from any issue or vulnerability within the Salesforce platform,\u201d and that \u201ca forensic analysis is continuing as part of a comprehensive and independent review.\u201d\n\u201cSalesforce has temporarily revoked active access tokens for Gainsight-connected apps as a precautionary measure while their investigation into unusual activity continues,\u201d according to Gainsight\u2019s incident page, which said Salesforce is notifying affected customers whose data was stolen.\nIn its Telegram channel, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters said it plans to launch a dedicated website to extort the victims of its latest campaign by next week. This is the group\u2019s modus operandi; in October, the hackers also published a similar extortion website after stealing victims\u2019 Salesforce data in the Salesloft incident.\nThe Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of English-speaking hackers made up of several cybercriminal gangs, including ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$, whose members use social engineering tactics to trick company employees into granting the hackers access to their systems or databases. In the last few years, these groups have claimed several high-profile victims, such as MGM Resorts, Coinbase, DoorDash, and more.\nThis story was updated to include comments from Docusign, Thomson Reuters, and Verizon.\n\ntitle1:\nCrowdStrike fires 'suspicious insider' who passed information to hackers\ndescription1:\nCybersecurity giant CrowdStrike has confirmed firing a \u201csuspicious insider\u201d last month who allegedly fed information about the company to a notorious hacking group.\nA hacking collective known as Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters published screenshots late Thursday and Friday morning in a public Telegram channel that allegedly showed insider access to CrowdStrike systems. The screenshots, which TechCrunch has seen, show dashboards containing links to company resources, including a user\u2019s Okta dashboard used by employees for accessing internal apps.\nThe hackers claimed in the Telegram channel to have compromised CrowdStrike through a recent breach at Gainsight, a customer relationship management company that helps Salesforce customers track and manage their own customers\u2019 data. The hackers said they used information stolen from Gainsight to break into CrowdStrike.\nBut CrowdStrike says the hackers\u2019 claims are \u201cfalse,\u201d and says it terminated the insider\u2019s access after the company \u201cdetermined he shared pictures of his computer screen externally.\u201d\n\u201cOur systems were never compromised and customers remained protected throughout. We have turned the case over to relevant law enforcement agencies,\u201d CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch.\nSeveral other tech companies were allegedly hacked as part of the same campaign. Gainsight did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s requests for comment.\nScattered Lapsus$ Hunters is a collective of hackers made up of several hacking groups, notably ShinyHunters, Scattered Spider, and Lapsus$. The group\u2019s members use social engineering techniques to trick employees into granting them access to their systems or databases.\nIn October, Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claimed to have stolen more than 1 billion records from corporate giants who rely on Salesforce to host their customer data. The hackers published a data leak site listing data stolen from companies, including insurance giant Allianz Life, the airline Qantas, carmaker Stellantis, credit bureau TransUnion, the employee management platform Workday, and others.\n\ntitle2:\nBret Taylor's Sierra reaches $100M ARR in under two years\ndescription2:\nSierra, a 21-month-old, San Francisco-based startup that builds customer service AI agents for enterprises, announced on Friday that it reached $100 million in annual revenue run rate (ARR). The company\u2019s rapid growth suggests that businesses across industries are embracing AI agents.\nThe startup\u2019s growth rate surprised even its seasoned co-founders, former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and longtime Google alum Clay Bavor, who wrote on their blog: \u201cThat\u2019s a heck of a lot quicker than we expected.\u201d\nSierra\u2019s customers include tech companies like Deliveroo, Discord, Ramp, Rivian, SoFi, and Tubi, as well as well-established businesses outside of the tech sector, such as ADT, Bissell, Vans, Cigna, and SiriusXM.\nTaylor and Bavor said they expected tech companies would feel comfortable experimenting with AI customer service agents, but they were astounded that older businesses also became Sierra\u2019s customers.\nThe company says it can build AI agents that can handle tasks like authenticating patients for healthcare providers, processing returns, ordering replacement credit cards, and helping customers apply for mortgages \u2014 essentially automating customer service work that previously required human agents.\nSierra faces competition from startups like Decagon and Intercom, but the company claims to be the leader in the AI customer service category.\nSierra was last valued at $10 billion when it raised a $350 million round led by Greenoaks Capital in September. Other investors in the company include Sequoia, Benchmark, ICONIQ, and Thrive Capital.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nBased on its $100 million ARR, Sierra is currently valued at a 100x revenue multiple, a hefty valuation despite its exceptionally fast growth.\nThe startup employs an outcomes-based pricing model, charging customers for completed work rather than charging flat subscription fees.\nTaylor and Bavor met at Google in 2005, where Taylor hired Bavor as an associate product manager.\nA Stanford computer science graduate, Taylor co-created Google Maps before founding FriendFeed, which Facebook acquired. At Facebook, he served as CTO and helped create the iconic \u201cLike\u201d button. He later founded Quip, a Google Docs competitor that Salesforce acquired for $750 million in 2016.\nTaylor went on to serve as Salesforce co-CEO alongside Marc Benioff for over a year. After Taylor left Salesforce in 2023, Bavor \u2014 who had spent 18 years at Google leading products like Gmail and Google Drive \u2014 invited him to lunch, where they decided to launch Sierra.\n\ntitle3:\nThe hottest AI wearables and gadgets you can buy right now\ndescription3:\nA new wave of AI-powered gadgets on the market aims to integrate artificial intelligence into our daily lives like never before.\nSome of these AI wearables \u2014 including necklaces, rings, and wristbands, as well as portable devices \u2014 serve as productivity tools, while others claim to act as friendly companions listening to your everyday thoughts.

It recognizes your tone and mood, allowing you to chat with it as if it were a friend. It connects to your phone via Bluetooth and constantly listens, ready to respond or send you proactive messages, like wishing you good luck before an interview.\nHowever, it has also faced criticism, including a recent backlash against its subway ad campaign in NYC. People vandalized the ads, writing messages like \u201csurveillance capitalism.\u201d\nLimitless\nImage Credits:Limitless\nFormerly known as Rewind, Limitless is another conversation-recording pendant priced at $99.\nThis device continuously listens, transcribing meetings, calls, and conversations (with consent) into searchable and summarized knowledge. It\u2019s ideal for professionals, especially journalists, looking to recall important discussions.\nThe companion app comes with 10 hours of AI features per month \u2014 such as transcription and summaries \u2014 with the option to unlock unlimited features for $29 per month.\nOmi\nImage Credits:Omi\nPriced at $89, this device can answer your questions, summarize your conversations, create to-do lists, and help schedule meetings. Additionally, Omi is constantly listening and running your conversations through ChatGPT, allowing it to remember the context about you and offer personalized advice.\nOmi can be worn as a necklace, but another notable aspect is that it can be attached to the side of your head with medical tape and can detect when you\u2019re speaking to it.\nPlaud\u2019s NotePin\nImage Credits:Plaud\nAt $159, Plaud\u2019s NotePin is one of the pricier options on this list; however, its built-in AI transcription and summarization features make it a valuable tool for lawyers, journalists, and students attending meetings or lectures.\nThe tiny wearable voice recorder can be worn on your wrist or attached magnetically to your clothing. The recordings are saved in real time on your phone, eliminating the hassle of manual note-taking. The device includes 300 free monthly transcription minutes, but with the $8.33 per month Pro plan, you upgrade your transcription time to 1,200 minutes.\nThis year, the company is gearing up to launch a $179 ultra-thin note-taking device called the Plaud Note Pro, which is now available for preorder.\nRabbit R1\nImage Credits:Rabbit\nRabbit R1 is another AI gadget that has quickly become a topic of interest in the tech world, despite facing some challenges during its initial launch. This small, retro-styled handheld device features a touchscreen and rotating camera, at a price point of $199.\nThe device is designed to be phone-adjacent, allowing you to perform tasks such as booking flights, ordering meals, and controlling apps without needing to pull out your phone each time. Following a crucial software update that rectified previous performance issues, the Rabbit R1 now boasts expanded AI features. For instance, it introduces \u201cCreations,\u201d a feature that allows you to build your own tools and even games.\n\ntitle4:\nHow this founder\u2019s unlikely path to Silicon Valley could become an edge in industrial tech\ndescription4:\nThomas Lee Young doesn\u2019t sound like your typical Silicon Valley founder.\nThe 24-year-old CEO of Interface, a San Francisco startup using AI to prevent industrial accidents, is a white guy with a Caribbean accent and a Chinese last name, a combination he finds amusing enough to mention when he\u2019s first introduced to business contacts. Born and raised in Trinidad and Tobago, the site of substantial oil and gas exploration activity, Young grew up around oil rigs and energy infrastructure because his entire family worked as engineers, stretching back generations to his great-grandfather, who immigrated to the island nation from China.\nThat background has become his calling card in pitch meetings with oil and gas executives today, but it makes for more than a great conversation starter; it underscores a path that has been anything but straightforward and that Young might argue gives Interface an edge.\nIt was years in the making. From age 11, Young fixated on Caltech with the intensity of someone much older. He watched shows about Silicon Valley online, mesmerized by the idea that people could build \u201canything and everything\u201d in America. He did everything possible to secure admission, even writing his application essay about hijacking his family\u2019s Roomba to create 3D spatial maps of his house.\nThe ploy worked \u2013 Caltech accepted him in 2020 \u2013 but then COVID-19 hit, and so did its ripple effects. For one thing, Young\u2019s visa situation became nearly impossible (visa appointments were cancelled and processing came to a halt). At the same time, his college fund, carefully built over six or seven years to $350,000 to cover his education, \u201cbasically got hit entirely\u201d by the abrupt market downturn in March of that year.\nWithout a lot of time to decide his future, he chose a cheaper three-year engineering program at the University of Bristol in the UK, studying mechanical engineering, but never abandoning his Silicon Valley dreams. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I realized I could still get something done.\u201d\nAt Bristol, Young landed at Jaguar Land Rover, working in something called human factors engineering \u2013 essentially the UX and safety design of industrial systems. \u201cI had never heard of it before I even joined,\u201d he admits. The role involved figuring out how to make cars and manufacturing lines as safe as possible, ensuring they were \u201cdummy proof\u201d for smooth operations.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

He says the tools many companies use to manage safety documentation are either nonexistent \u2013 pen and paper \u2013 or so siloed and poorly designed that workers hate them. Worse, the operating procedures themselves \u2014 the instruction manuals and checklists that blue-collar workers rely on to stay safe \u2014 are riddled with errors, outdated, and nearly impossible to maintain.\nYoung pitched Jaguar on letting him build a solution, but the company wasn\u2019t interested. So he started plotting his exit. When he learned about Entrepreneur First (EF), a European talent incubator that recruits promising individuals before they have a co-founder or even an idea, he cold applied despite its 1% acceptance rate. He was accepted to essentially pitch himself.\nHe told Jaguar he was going to a wedding in Trinidad and would be away for a week. Instead, he went to EF\u2019s selection process, impressed the organizers, and the day he returned to the office, quit. \u201cThey realized, \u2018Oh, so you probably weren\u2019t at a wedding,\u2019\u201d he laughs.\nAt EF, Young met Aaryan Mehta, his future co-founder and CTO. Mehta, of Indian descent but born in Belgium, had his own thwarted American dream. He\u2019d been accepted to both Georgia Tech and Penn but similarly couldn\u2019t get a visa appointment during COVID. He ended up studying math and computer science at Imperial College London, where he developed AI for fault detection before building machine learning pipelines at Amazon.\n\u201cWe had similar backgrounds,\u201d Young says. \u201cHe\u2019s super international. He speaks five languages, very technical, amazing guy, and we got along very well.\u201d In fact, they were the only team in their EF cohort not to break up, says Young.\nMore than that, today, they live together in San Francisco\u2019s SoMa neighborhood, though asked about spending so much time together, Young is adamant that that\u2019s not an issue given their respective workloads. \u201cOver the last week, I\u2019ve seen [Aaryan] at home for maybe a combined total of 30 minutes.\u201d\nAs for what, exactly, they are building, Interface\u2019s pitch is straightforward: use AI to make heavy industry safer. The company autonomously audits operating procedures using large language models, cross-checking them against regulations, technical drawings, and corporate policies to catch errors that could \u2013 in a worst-case scenario \u2013 get workers killed.\nSome of the numbers are arresting. For one of Canada\u2019s largest energy companies, where Interface is now deployed across three sites (Young declines to name the brand), Interface\u2019s software found 10,800 errors and improvements across the company\u2019s standard operating procedures in just two and a half months. As Young tells it, the same work done manually would have cost more than $35 million and taken two to three years.\nOne error Young found particularly troubling, he says, was a document that had been in circulation for 10 years with the wrong pressure range listed for a valve. \u201cThey\u2019re just lucky that nothing happened,\u201d says Medha Agarwal, a partner at Defy.vc, which led Interface\u2019s $3.5 million seed round earlier this year, with participation from Precursor, Rockyard Ventures, and angel investors, including Charlie Songhurst.\nThe contracts are considerable. After initially trying outcome-based pricing (the energy company \u201chated it,\u201d Young says), Interface adopted a hybrid per-seat model with overage costs. A single contract with the Canadian energy company is worth more than $2.5 million annually, and Interface has more fuel and oil services customers coming online in Houston, Guyana, and Brazil.\nThe total addressable market isn\u2019t entirely clear, but it\u2019s not small. In the U.S. alone, there are something like 27,000 oil and gas services companies, per the market research outfit IBISWorld, and that\u2019s just the first vertical that Interface wants to tackle.\nThe outsider\u2019s edge\nInterestingly, Young\u2019s age and background \u2013 things that might seem like disadvantages when it comes to more established industries \u2013 have become his secret weapons. When he walks into a room of executives twice or three times his age, he says, there\u2019s initial skepticism. \u201cWho the hell is this young guy and how does he know what he\u2019s talking about?\u201d\nBut then, he says, he delivers his \u201cwow moment,\u201d by explaining an understanding of their operations, their workers\u2019 daily routines, and exactly how much time and money Interface can save them. \u201cOnce you can flip them, they will absolutely love you and advocate and fight for you,\u201d he says. (He claims that after a recent, first site visit with operators, five workers asked when they could invest in Interface, which made him particularly proud, given the field workers typically \u201chate software providers.\u201d)\nIndeed, though Young works from Interface\u2019s office in San Francisco\u2019s Financial District, his hard hat sits on a table not far from his desk, ready for the next site visit. (Agarwal suggests Young could use a little more down time in his life, recalling a recent call where Young told her that he hadn\u2019t seen the sun all day.)\nThe company now has eight employees \u2013 five in the office, three remote \u2013 mostly engineering hires, plus an operations person who started just this week. Interface\u2019s biggest challenge is hiring fast enough to keep up with demand, a problem that requires its small team to tap networks across both Europe and the US.\nAs for what Young makes of the life in San Francisco he wanted and is now living, he marvels at how accurate the Silicon Valley stereotypes turned out to be. \u201cYou see people online talking about, \u2018Oh, you go to a park and the person sitting next to you has raised $50 million building some insane AI agent.\u2019 But it is actually like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI think back to what life was like in Trinidad. I mention these ideas to people back home, and they just don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\nHe occasionally makes time to go out in nature with friends \u2013 he says they went to Tahoe recently \u2013 and Interface hosts events like a hackathon they threw last weekend. But mostly, it\u2019s work, and most of that work involves AI, just like everyone else\u2019s in San Francisco right now.\nWhich makes the trips to oil rigs oddly appealing.\nIndeed, that hard hat at the office isn\u2019t just a practical necessity; it\u2019s also a lure, suggests Young. For engineers tired of building \u201csome low-impact B2B sales or recruiting tool,\u201d as Young puts it, the promise of occasionally leaving the Bay Area bubble to work with operators in the field has become a recruiting advantage. Less than 1% of San Francisco startups work in heavy industry, he notes, and that scarcity is part of the appeal, for him and for the people he\u2019s hiring.\nIt\u2019s probably not quite the version of the Silicon Valley dream he spent his childhood chasing from Trinidad: long hours, intense pressure, endless AI discussions everywhere, punctuated by the occasional trip to an oil rig.\nStill, for now, he doesn\u2019t seem to mind it. \u201cOver the last month or two months, I have not done much at all [outside the office], because there\u2019s just been so much intensity here, with building, hiring, selling.\u201d But \u201cI feel pretty strong,\u201d he adds.\"\n\nResponse:",
