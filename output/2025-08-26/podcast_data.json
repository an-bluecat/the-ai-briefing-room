Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday August 27), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft headquarters go into lockdown after activists take over Brad Smith's office\ndescription0:\nProtesters stormed Microsoft\u2019s Redmond headquarters on Monday and made it into president Brad Smith\u2019s office in Building 34, forcing a temporary lockdown. The \u201cNo Azure for Apartheid\u201d group reportedly livestreamed their sit-in on Twitch, hoisting banners, chanting \u2018Brad Smith, you can\u2019t hide, you\u2019re supporting genocide!\u2019 and posting a mock legal summons charging Smith with \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d\nTechCrunch has reached out to Microsoft for more information.\nAccording to The Verge, the protest included both active Microsoft workers and former employees who\u2019ve been fired for previous activism. Monday\u2019s escalation follows months of protests over Microsoft\u2019s cloud contracts with Israel, including recent arrests at company headquarters.\nA recent Guardian investigation revealed Israel uses Microsoft\u2019s services to store data from millions of calls each day made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\nToday\u2019s corporate takeover mirrors tactics from Google employees more than a year ago. In April 2024, nine Google workers staged coordinated protests across New York and California offices, with five occupying Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian\u2019s office for nine hours. They wrote demands on his whiteboard and wore \u201cGoogler against genocide\u201d shirts.\nThe Google protesters targeted Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract with Amazon that provides Israel\u2019s government and military with cloud computing and AI tools. The employees\u2019 sit-ins and arrests were similarly livestreamed on Twitch; three days later, 28 employees involved in those protests were fired.\n\ntitle1:\nVerily is closing its medical device program as Alphabet shifts more resources to AI\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nAlphabet\u2019s life sciences arm Verily laid off staff and eliminated its entire devices program Monday.\nCEO Stephen Gillett announced the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to wind down the program in a staff memo, according to Business Insider.\n\u201cOver the years, Verily has built a legacy in developing world-class, innovative medical devices,\u201d Gillett wrote, noting that the \u201cpath forward requires difficult decisions\u201d as Verily refocuses on AI and data infrastructure.\nThe move continues Alphabet\u2019s aggressive efforts to invest in AI while cutting costs elsewhere. The company has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, including cuts to its HR and cloud units in February and voluntary exit programs for its more than 25,000 Platforms & Devices employees in spring.\nAlphabet\u2019s biggest recent layoffs came in January 2023, when it slashed 12,000 jobs \u2014 6% of its workforce at the time \u2014 in anticipation of an economic slowdown.\nThat same month, ChatGPT became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in two months and kicking off the generative AI boom that today drives the tech industry\u2019s priorities.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta to spend tens of millions on pro-AI super PAC\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nMeta plans to launch a super PAC to support California candidates favoring a light-touch approach to AI regulation, Politico reports. The news comes as other Silicon Valley behemoths, like Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI\u2019s Greg Brockman, pledge $100 million for a new pro-AI super PAC.\nMeta will pour tens of millions into its new group, dubbed Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across California, according to Politico. Brian Rice, Meta\u2019s VP of public policy and head of the new PAC, has argued that Sacramento\u2019s regulatory environment \u201ccould stifle innovation, block AI progress, and put California\u2019s technology leadership at risk.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s lobbying force earlier this year targeted state senator Scott Wiener\u2019s SB-53 bill that would require AI firms to publish safety and security protocols and issue reports when safety incidents occur. Last year, it helped kill the Kids Online Safety Act that was widely expected to pass.\nThe social media giant has already donated to various down-ballet candidates from both parties. This new PAC signals an intent to influence statewide elections, including the next governor\u2019s race in 2026.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

The agent, Claude for Chrome, is rolling out to a group of 1,000 subscribers on Anthropic\u2019s Max plan, which costs between $100 and $200 per month. The company is also opening a waitlist for other interested users.\nBy adding an extension to Chrome, select users can now chat with Claude in a sidecar window that maintains context of everything happening in their browser. Users can also give the Claude agent permission to take actions in their browser and complete some tasks on their behalf.\nThe browser is quickly becoming the next battleground for AI labs, which aim to use browser integrations to offer more seamless connections between AI systems and their users. Perplexity recently launched its own browser, Comet, which features an AI agent that can offload tasks for users. OpenAI is reportedly close to launching its own AI-powered browser, which is rumored to have similar features to Comet. Meanwhile, Google has launched Gemini integrations with Chrome in recent months.\nThe race to develop AI-powered browsers is especially pressing given Google\u2019s looming antitrust case, in which a final decision is expected any day now. The federal judge in the case has suggested he may force Google to sell its Chrome browser. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer for Chrome, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested his company would be willing to buy it as well.\nIn the Tuesday blog post, Anthropic warned that the rise of AI agents with browser access poses new safety risks. Last week, Brave\u2019s security team said it found that Comet\u2019s browser agent could be vulnerable to indirect prompt-injection attacks, where hidden code on a website could trick the agent into executing malicious instructions when it processed the page.\n(Perplexity\u2019s head of communications, Jesse Dwyer, told TechCrunch in an email that the vulnerability Brave raised has been fixed.)\nAnthropic says it hopes to use this research preview as a chance to catch and address novel safety risks; however, the company has already introduced several defenses against prompt injection attacks. The company says its interventions reduced the success rate of prompt injection attacks from 23.6% to 11.2%.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nFor example, Anthropic says users can limit Claude\u2019s browser agent from accessing certain sites in the app\u2019s settings, and the company has, by default, blocked Claude from accessing websites that offer financial services, adult content, and pirated content. The company also says that Claude\u2019s browser agent will ask for user permission before \u201ctaking high-risk actions like publishing, purchasing, or sharing personal data.\u201d\nThis isn\u2019t Anthropic\u2019s first foray into AI models that can control your computer screen. In October 2024, the company launched an AI agent that could control your PC \u2014 however, testing at the time revealed that the model was quite slow and unreliable.\nThe capabilities of agentic AI models have improved quite a bit since then. TechCrunch has found that modern browser-using AI agents, such as Comet and ChatGPT Agent, are fairly reliable at offloading simple tasks for users. However, many of these agentic systems still struggle with more complex problems.\n\ntitle4:\nAfter falling behind in generative AI, IBM and AMD look to quantum for an edge\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nIBM and AMD are partnering to develop next-generation computing architectures that integrate IBM\u2019s quantum systems with AMD\u2019s AI-specialized chips. The move could position both the tech giant and chipmaker as key infrastructure players as they look to regain ground after falling behind on the generative AI boom.\nTogether, IBM and AMD will attempt to launch a commercially viable quantum computing architecture \u2014 one that\u2019s scalable and open sourced. In other words, it will be more widely accessible to researchers and developers solving complex real-world problems in fields like drug and materials discovery, optimization, and logistics, per IBM.\n\u201cQuantum computing will simulate the natural world and represent information in an entirely new way,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM, in a statement. \u201cBy exploring how quantum computers from IBM and the advanced high-performance compute technologies of AMD can work together, we will build a powerful hybrid model that pushes past the limits of traditional computing.\u201d\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?
