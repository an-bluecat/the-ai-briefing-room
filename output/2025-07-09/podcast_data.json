Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Althoff noted AI has been so useful that Microsoft was able to save more than $500 million last year in its call center alone.\nThe internal remarks come a week after Microsoft laid off more than 9,000 workers, the company\u2019s third round of layoffs this year that put the total number of affected employees somewhere around 15,000.\nFor employees who lost their jobs while working at a company that is reporting impressive cost-savings and recording one of its most profitable quarters yet, Althoff\u2019s remarks might come off as tone deaf.\nThe situation had already been complicated by a now-deleted LinkedIn post from Xbox Game Studios\u2019 producer Matt Turnbull, who last week suggested that workers feeling \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by Microsoft\u2019s layoffs \u2014 which included job cuts across Xbox \u2014 might find support through AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to help manage the cognitive load that comes with job loss.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether the thousands of workers who lost their jobs this year were replaced by AI or whether the layoffs represent post-pandemic right-sizing. What is clear is that workforce adjustments during a period of record profitability creates a challenging dynamic that, for some, has to sting.\nMicrosoft closed out the first quarter with $26 billion in profit and $70 billion in revenue. The company\u2019s market capitalization has also surged in recent months to around $3.74 trillion, displacing Apple and trailing only Nvidia.\nMicrosoft has signaled that much of that profit will flow directly into AI. The company said in January it would invest $80 billion into AI infrastructure across 2025. While Microsoft continues to hire talent, too, the company appears positioned to more actively participate in the industrywide competition of \u201cWho Can Pay Top AI Researchers The Most?\u201d In short, it\u2019s more likely we\u2019ll see Microsoft spend millions of dollars on top AI researchers rather than middle managers and other employees.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI is reportedly releasing an AI browser in the coming weeks\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nHot on the heels of Perplexity\u2019s Comet launch, OpenAI is planning to release an AI-powered web browser of its own to challenge Google Chrome, according to a report from Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe ChatGPT maker reportedly aims to release its browser in the coming weeks. Much like Perplexity\u2019s Comet and The Browser Company\u2019s Dia, OpenAI\u2019s browser is said to use AI to rethink how users browse the web. Supposedly, the browser keeps some user interactions inside ChatGPT instead of linking out to websites. Reuters reports that OpenAI\u2019s browser may integrate Operator, the company\u2019s web-browsing AI agent, as a key feature.\nOpenAI had considered building a browser to compete with Google Chrome in 2024, according to The Information. Much like Perplexity, OpenAI likely wants to get direct access to user data and have the freedom to create novel user experiences that aren\u2019t intermediated by Google.\n\ntitle2:\nCalifornia lawmaker behind SB 1047 reignites push for mandated AI safety reports\ndescription2:\nCalifornia State Senator Scott Wiener on Wednesday introduced new amendments to his latest bill, SB 53, that would require the world\u2019s largest AI companies to publish safety and security protocols and issue reports when safety incidents occur.\nIf signed into law, California would be the first state to impose meaningful transparency requirements onto leading AI developers, likely including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and xAI.\nSenator Wiener\u2019s previous AI bill, SB 1047, included similar requirements for AI model developers to publish safety reports. However, Silicon Valley fought ferociously against that bill, and it was ultimately vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. California\u2019s governor then called for a group of AI leaders \u2014 including the leading Stanford researcher and co-founder of World Labs, Fei-Fei Li \u2014 to form a policy group and set goals for the state\u2019s AI safety efforts.\nCalifornia\u2019s AI policy group recently published their final recommendations, citing a need for \u201crequirements on industry to publish information about their systems\u201d in order to establish a \u201crobust and transparent evidence environment.\u201d Senator Wiener\u2019s office said in a press release that SB 53\u2019s amendments were heavily influenced by this report.\n\u201cThe bill continues to be a work in progress, and I look forward to working with all stakeholders in the coming weeks to refine this proposal into the most scientific and fair law it can be,\u201d Senator Wiener said in the release.\nSB 53 aims to strike a balance that Governor Newsom claimed SB 1047 failed to achieve \u2014 ideally, creating meaningful transparency requirements for the largest AI developers without thwarting the rapid growth of California\u2019s AI industry.\n\u201cThese are concerns that my organization and others have been talking about for a while,\u201d said Nathan Calvin, VP of State Affairs for the nonprofit AI safety group, Encode, in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cHaving companies explain to the public and government what measures they\u2019re taking to address these risks feels like a bare minimum, reasonable step to take.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe bill also creates whistleblower protections for employees of AI labs who believe their company\u2019s technology poses a \u201ccritical risk\u201d to society \u2014 defined in the bill as contributing to the death or injury of more than 100 people, or more than $1 billion in damage.\nAdditionally, the bill aims to create CalCompute, a public cloud computing cluster to support startups and researchers developing large-scale AI.\nUnlike SB 1047, Senator Wiener\u2019s new bill does not make AI model developers liable for the harms of their AI models. SB 53 was also designed not to pose a burden on startups and researchers that fine-tune AI models from leading AI developers, or use open source models.\nWith the new amendments, SB 53 is now headed to the California State Assembly Committee on Privacy and Consumer Protection for approval. Should it pass there, the bill will also need to pass through several other legislative bodies before reaching Governor Newsom\u2019s desk.\nOn the other side of the U.S., New York Governor Kathy Hochul is now considering a similar AI safety bill, the RAISE Act, which would also require large AI developers to publish safety and security reports.\nThe fate of state AI laws like the RAISE Act and SB 53 were briefly in jeopardy as federal lawmakers considered a 10-year AI moratorium on state AI regulation \u2014 an attempt to limit a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of AI laws that companies would have to navigate. However, that proposal failed in a 99-1 Senate vote earlier in July.\n\u201cEnsuring AI is developed safely should not be controversial \u2014 it should be foundational,\u201d said Geoff Ralston, the former president of Y Combinator, in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cCongress should be leading, demanding transparency and accountability from the companies building frontier models. But with no serious federal action in sight, states must step up. California\u2019s SB 53 is a thoughtful, well-structured example of state leadership.\u201d\nUp to this point, lawmakers have failed to get AI companies on board with state-mandated transparency requirements. Anthropic has broadly endorsed the need for increased transparency into AI companies, and even expressed modest optimism about the recommendations from California\u2019s AI policy group. But companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta have been more resistant to these efforts.\nLeading AI model developers typically publish safety reports for their AI models, but they\u2019ve been less consistent in recent months. Google, for example, decided not to publish a safety report for its most advanced AI model ever released, Gemini 2.5 Pro, until months after it was made available. OpenAI also decided not to publish a safety report for its GPT-4.1 model. Later, a third-party study came out that suggested it may be less aligned than previous AI models.\nSB 53 represents a toned-down version of previous AI safety bills, but it still could force AI companies to publish more information than they do today. For now, they\u2019ll be watching closely as Senator Wiener once again tests those boundaries.\n\ntitle3:\nNeobank Revolut seeks $65B valuation, a year after its $45B deal\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nEurope\u2019s fintech darling Revolut is looking to raise a new funding round that would give it a $65 billion valuation, the Financial Times reports.\nThe U.K.-based company is reportedly in talks to raise around $1 billion by issuing new shares and selling existing ones. The U.S.-based firm Greenoaks is said to be leading the round, though the deal has not been finalized, and terms could change.\nTechCrunch reported in April that the company saw a 72% increase in revenue last year, netting $1 billion in profit. The company also saw a spike in users, having more than 50 million customers (it received its banking licenses to operate in the U.K. last year and now serves over 30 countries).\nRevolut was last valued at $45 billion in 2024 after selling shares on the secondary market and subsequently became one of the most valuable tech companies in Europe.\nRevolut declined to comment.\n\ntitle4:\nYouTube prepares crackdown on 'mass-produced' and 'repetitive' videos, as concern over AI slop grows\ndescription4:\nYouTube is preparing to update its policies to crack down on creators\u2019 ability to generate revenue from \u201cinauthentic\u201d content, including mass-produced videos and other types of repetitive content \u2014 things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology.\nOn July 15, the company will update its YouTube Partner Program (YPP) Monetization policies with more detailed guidelines around what type of content can earn creators money and what cannot.\nThe exact policy language itself has not yet been released, but a page on YouTube\u2019s Help documentation explains that creators have always been required to upload \u201coriginal\u201d and \u201cauthentic\u201d content. The update says that the new language will help creators to better understand what \u201cinauthentic\u201d content looks like today.\nSome YouTube creators were concerned that the update would limit their ability to monetize certain types of videos, like reaction videos or those featuring clips, but a post from YouTube Head of Editorial & Creator Liaison Rene Ritchie says that\u2019s not the case.\nIn a video update published on Tuesday, Ritchie says that the change is just a \u201cminor update\u201d to YouTube\u2019s longstanding YPP policies and is designed to better identify when content is mass-produced or repetitive.\nPlus, Ritchie adds, this type of content has been ineligible for monetization for years, as it\u2019s content that viewers often consider spam.\nWhat Ritchie is not saying, however, is how much easier it is to create such videos these days.\nWith the rise of AI technology, YouTube has become flooded with AI slop, a term referencing low-quality media or content made using generative AI technology. For instance, it\u2019s common to find an AI voice overlaid on photos, video clips, or other repurposed content, thanks to text-to-video AI tools. Some channels filled with AI music have millions of subscribers. Fake, AI-generated videos about news events, like the Diddy trial, have racked up millions of views.\nIn another example, a true crime murder series on YouTube that went viral was found to be entirely AI-generated, 404 Media reported earlier this year. Even YouTube CEO Neal Mohan\u2019s likeness was used in an AI-generated phishing scam on the site, despite having tools in place that allow users to report deepfake videos.\nWhile YouTube may downplay the coming changes as a \u201cminor\u201d update or clarification, the reality is that allowing this type of content to grow and its creators to profit could ultimately damage YouTube\u2019s reputation and value. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that the company wants clear policies in place that allow it to enact mass bans of AI slop creators from YPP.\"\n\nResponse:",
