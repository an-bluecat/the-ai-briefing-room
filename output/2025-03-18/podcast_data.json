Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday March 19), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title1:\nNvidia announces two 'personal AI supercomputers'\ndescription1:\nNvidia at GTC 2025 announced a new lineup of \u201cAI personal supercomputers\u201d powered by the company\u2019s Grace Blackwell chip platform.\nJensen Huang, the semiconductor company\u2019s founder and CEO, unveiled the two new machines, DGX Spark (previously called Project Digits) and DGX Station, during his keynote on Tuesday. The computers will allow users to prototype, fine-tune, and run AI models in a range of sizes at the edge.\n\u201cThis is the computer of the age of AI,\u201d Huang said during the presentation. \u201cThis is what computers should look like, and this is what computers will run in the future. And we have a whole lineup for enterprise now, from little, tiny ones to workstation ones.\u201d\nDGX Spark delivers up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of AI computing thanks to a GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, Nvidia says. As for the DGX Station, it features Nvidia\u2019s GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Desktop Superchip combined with 784GB of memory.\nDGX Spark is available now, while DGX Station is expected to be released later this year through manufacturing partners, including Asus, Boxx, Dell, HP, and Lenovo.\n\u201cAI agents will be everywhere,\u201d Huang continued. \u201cHow they run, what enterprises run, and how we run it will be fundamentally different. And so we need a new line of computers. And this is it.\u201d\nCheck out TechCrunch\u2019s other coverage of all the news and announcements from GTC over on our live blog.\n\ntitle2:\nTrump fires FTC commissioners, setting up a legal battle\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nPresident Trump fired the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Tuesday, setting up a challenge to a 1935 Supreme Court precedent prohibiting the firing of FTC commissioners for reasons other than \u201cgood cause.\u201d\nThe White House terminated commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya earlier Tuesday, The New York Times reported. In a statement, Slaughter called the firings \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\u201cToday the president illegally fired me from my position as a federal trade commissioner, violating the plain language of a statute and clear Supreme Court precedent,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cWhy? Because I have a voice. And he is afraid of what I\u2019ll tell the American people.\u201d\nThe FTC, which typically has five members, was established in 1914 and is charged with enforcing consumer protection and antitrust laws. The Trump administration has aggressively challenged the authority of independent regulatory agencies, including the FTC.\n\ntitle3:\nConfirmed: Google buys Wiz for $32B to beef up in cloud security\ndescription3:\nGoogle is making the biggest acquisition in its history. The company\u2019s parent company Alphabet is buying Wiz, the cloud security startup, for $32 billion in an all-cash transaction. The deal has now been confirmed.\nA source described the transaction as a $33 billion deal previously. That includes the $1 billion that Google is paying out on top of the acquisition price in the form of retention bonuses to make sure everyone stays on post-acquisition. With 1,700 people working at the company, that works out on average to more than $588,000 per employee (actual numbers likely to go up and down depending on their respective salaries).\nWiz will remain an independent platform that will work across all cloud providers, not just Google Cloud Platform. There will be more hiring to expand the business, and likely more acquisitions, which is something Wiz has been working to do for the last year.\nOur sources tell us that Wiz is at $700 million in annual recurring revenue at the moment. The deal is being described to us as akin to the one between LinkedIn and Microsoft, in terms of autonomy within the bigger organization. (It should be noted that LinkedIn does use a lot of Microsoft services, and has increased that over time, so perhaps that\u2019s a more meaningful analogy than was intended.)\nThe deal will still need regulatory and other approvals before closing, which the companies expect will be in 2026. Previously, Google\u2019s biggest acquisition had been buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in 2011.\nThis acquisition has been on-again off-again for nearly a year. Talks appeared to revive again this week at a $30 billion price tag.\nThomas Kurian \u2014 the CEO of Google Cloud \u2014 is in Europe at the moment, and Assaf Rappaport, the CEO of New York-based Wiz, is currently in Israel. From what we understand, Kurian was leading on this deal, and Wiz will come under his wing, spearheading a major push into cloud security for the company.\n\u201cGoogle Cloud and Wiz share a joint vision to make cybersecurity more accessible and simpler to use for organizations of any size and industry,\u201d he said in a statement today. \u201cEnabling more companies to prevent cyber attacks, including in very complex business software environments, will help organizations minimize the cost, disruption and hassle caused by cybersecurity incidents.\u201d\nSome backstory. Last year, Google offered to buy Wiz for $23 billion, but the talks fell apart, sources say over concerns about antitrust issues, Wiz\u2019s autonomy for development under Google Cloud and potentially even the price tag. At the time of the deal talks, Wiz was valued at $12 billion based on a $1 billion funding round earlier in the year.\nIn the interim, there is now a new U.S. President and some believe the new regulatory regime will usher in a more favorable climate for big tech acquisitions that might have previously been roadblocked.\nFor its part, Google has been interested scooping up Wiz to turbo charge in two areas: enterprise cloud, a business where it continues to lag behind AWS and Microsoft Azure; and security, an area where it does offer some products (Mandiant being one key part of that) but nothing on the size, scale, or growth trajectory of Wiz.\nWiz is particularly attractive because it\u2019s coming to Google Cloud with an existing, massive business in tow. It is currently on track to double last year\u2019s annual recurring revenue to $1 billion.\nA Wiz acquisition also works to potentially complement, or even offset, whatever rises and falls might come to the other major area where Alphabet is placing bets: AI.\n\u201cThe increased role of AI, and adoption of cloud services, have dramatically changed the security landscape for customers, making cybersecurity increasingly important in defending against emergent risks and protecting national security,\u201d Google noted in its announcement today.\nNot long after the deal initially fell apart in 2024, Wiz ran a secondary sale at a $16 billion valuation, meaning this acquisition doubles that valuation. That\u2019s a huge windfall for Wiz\u2019s investors, which include the likes of Sequoia, Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Salesforce, Thrive Capital, Greenoaks and around two dozen others.\nRumors were that Wiz \u2014 whose founders previously co-founded and sold a security startup to Microsoft, which became the anchor of the company\u2019s cloud security business \u2014 was in the process of fundraising at an even higher valuation.\nLast year on stage at Disrupt, Rappaport didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of an acquisition in the future but he also confirmed that it was Wiz who walked away from the deal, describing it as \u201cthe toughest decision ever\u201d but also maintaining it was \u201cthe right choice.\u201d\nOn a purely financial outcome, it looks like his instinct has held true.\nWe will listen into the investor call later today and will update this story with more detail as it emerges.\n\ntitle4:\nJ. D. Vance claims freeing AI from regulation is good for American workers and tech innovators\ndescription4:\nOn Tuesday, Vice President J. D. Vance said that the Trump administration\u2019s support of AI and tech innovations should benefit both populists and those investing and leading tech companies.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s too much fear that AI will simply replace jobs rather than augmenting so many of the things that we do now,\u201d said Vance at the Andreessen Horowitz American Dynamism Summit in Washington, D.C.\nWhile Vance acknowledged that new technologies could lead to a displacement of certain jobs, as was the case with bank tellers when the ATM was invented, he said that history shows that innovation ultimately helps create more engaging, higher-paying jobs.\n\u201cWhat I propose is that each group, our workers, the Populists on the one hand, the tech optimists on the other, have been failed by this government, not just the government of the last administration, but the government in some ways, of the last 40 years,\u201d Vance said.\nBy not imposing significant regulations on AI, the Trump administration promises to give the tech sector the freedom to innovate.\nThe vice president also argued that \u201crearranging trade and tariff regime internationally\u201d as well as reduced immigration would act as a disincentive for offshoring.\n\u201cCheap labor is fundamentally a crutch, and it\u2019s a crutch that inhibits innovation,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people seeking cheap labor. We want them investing and building right here in the United States of America.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
