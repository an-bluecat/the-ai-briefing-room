    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday April 30), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft CEO says up to 30% of the company's code was written by AI\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella said that 20%-30% of code inside the company\u2019s repositories was \u201cwritten by software\u201d \u2014 meaning AI \u2014 during a fireside chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Meta\u2019s LlamaCon conference on Tuesday.\nNadella gave the figure after Zuckerberg asked roughly how much of Microsoft\u2019s code is AI-generated today. The Microsoft CEO said the company was seeing mixed results in AI-generated code across different languages, with more progress in Python and less in C++.\nMicrosoft CTO Kevin Scott previously said he expects 95% of all code to be AI-generated by 2030.\nWhen Nadella threw the question back at Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO said he didn\u2019t know how much of Meta\u2019s code is being generated by AI.\nOn Microsoft rival Google\u2019s earnings call last week, CEO Sundar Pichai said AI was generating more than 30% of the company\u2019s code. Of course, it\u2019s unclear how exactly Microsoft and Google are measuring what\u2019s AI-generated versus not, so these figures are best taken with a grain of salt.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta launches a stand-alone AI app to compete with ChatGPT\ndescription1:\nAfter integrating Meta AI into WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, Meta is rolling out a stand-alone AI app. Unveiled at Meta\u2019s LlamaCon event on Tuesday, this app allows users to access Meta AI in an app, similar to the ChatGPT app and other AI assistant apps.\nTo win over users, Meta is trying to leverage what makes it different from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic \u2014 Meta already has a sense of who you are, what you like, and who you hang out with based on years of data that you\u2019ve likely shared on Facebook or Instagram.\nMeta\u2019s AI app can differentiate itself from existing AI assistants because it can \u201c[draw] on information you\u2019ve already chosen to share on Meta products,\u201d the company said, such as your profile and the content you engage with. So far, these personalized responses will be available in the U.S. and Canada.\nYou can also give Meta more information about you to remember for future conversations with its AI \u2014 for example, you can tell the AI that you are lactose intolerant, which it could remember before recommending that you go to a wine and cheese tasting on your next vacation.\nAs with any AI product, users should be aware of how Meta may use the data they share with its chatbots. Meta relies on its wealth of user data to power its targeted advertising business, which makes up the bulk of its revenue.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta\u2019s AI app also introduces a Discover feed, where you can share how you\u2019re using AI with your friends \u2014 in a mock-up image, Meta shows someone asking the AI to describe them in three emojis, which they then shared with their friends. A user\u2019s interactions with Meta AI will only be shared to the feed if they choose to do so.\nThis feed might amplify certain generative AI trends, like the recent trend in which people tried to make themselves look like Barbie dolls or Studio Ghibli characters. But then again, not every app needs to have a social feed \u2014 we\u2019re looking at you, Venmo.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI rolls back update that made ChatGPT 'too sycophant-y'\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Tuesday the company is \u201crolling back\u201d the latest update to the default AI model powering ChatGPT, GPT-4o, after complaints about strange behavior, in particular extreme sycophancy.\n\u201c[W]e started rolling back the latest update to GPT-4o last night,\u201d Altman wrote in a post on X. \u201c[I]t\u2019s now 100% rolled back for free [ChatGPT] users and we\u2019ll update again when it\u2019s finished for paid users, hopefully later today. [W]e\u2019re working on additional fixes to model personality and will share more in the coming days.\u201d\nOver the weekend, users on social media blamed the updated model, which arrived toward the end of last week, for making ChatGPT overly validating and agreeable. It quickly became a meme. Users posted screenshots of ChatGPT applauding all sorts of problematic, dangerous decisions and ideas.\nOn Sunday, Altman acknowledged the problem and said that OpenAI would work on fixes \u201cASAP\u201d and would \u201cshare [its] learnings\u201d at some point.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta says its Llama AI models have been downloaded 1.2B times\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nIn mid-March, Meta said that its \u201copen\u201d AI model family, Llama, hit 1 billion downloads, up from 650 million downloads as of early December 2024. On Tuesday at its inaugural LlamaCon developer conference, Meta revealed that figure has reached 1.2 billion downloads.\n\u201cWe have thousands of developers contributing tens of thousands of derivative models being downloaded hundreds of thousands of times a month,\u201d said Meta chief product officer Chris Cox onstage during a keynote.\nMeanwhile, Meta AI, Meta\u2019s AI assistant powered by Llama models, has reached around a billion users, Cox added.\nMeta\u2019s Llama ecosystem is growing at a fast clip indeed, but the tech giant faces competition from a number of formidable players in the AI space. Just on Monday, Alibaba released Qwen3, a family of models that\u2019s highly competitive on a number of AI benchmarks.\n\ntitle4:\nWaymo and Toyota are dating - if they get serious, a new autonomous vehicle could be created\ndescription4:\nWaymo and Toyota have agreed to explore a possible deal that could one day lead to a new vehicle designed for ride-hailing and even bring self-driving tech into consumer cars.\nThe two companies have signed a preliminary agreement to look into developing and deploying an autonomous vehicle platform, according to a blog posted by Waymo. The language used by the companies is vague \u2014 and essentially comes down to a hey-let\u2019s-see-how-we-might-work-together arrangement. A spokesperson said more details will be shared if there is a definitive agreement.\nThe goal, if Waymo and Toyota officially partner, is twofold. The companies would combine their respective strengths to develop a new autonomous vehicle platform that would be used for a robotaxi service. The companies would also look at bringing Waymo\u2019s technology into the next generation of Toyota vehicles sold to consumers.\nThe scope of the collaboration will continue to evolve through ongoing discussions, Waymo said in the blog post.\n\u201cToyota is committed to realizing a society with zero traffic accidents and becoming a mobility company that delivers mobility for all,\u201d Hiroki Nakajima, member of the board and executive vice president of Toyota, said in a statement, adding the automaker shares \u201ca strong sense of purpose and a common vision with Waymo in advancing safety through automated driving technology.\u201d\nThe timing of the announcement is notable. Last week, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made remarks during the company\u2019s earnings call that suggested Waymo was looking at personally owned autonomous vehicles. Waymo has talked vaguely about licensing its tech before. However, this was the first time that the top executive of its parent company spoke publicly about the possibility.\nAs Waymo has transitioned from a research and development program to a commercial operation, the company has sought partnership with other businesses. Waymo has a robotaxi service in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, and soon Atlanta. Historically, Waymo has handled all aspects of the robotaxi business, including the app, maintenance, and ride-hailing operations.\nThat changed in recent months. Waymo has hired Moove to manage its fleet of AVs in Phoenix. It has also turned to Uber to share the responsibility for robotaxi operations in Austin, and soon in Atlanta.\nUnder the \u201cWaymo on Uber\u201d robotaxi service, Waymo is responsible for vehicle testing, roadside assistance, and certain aspects of rider support. Uber manages the fleet services such as vehicle cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging, and depot operations through a company called Avomo.\"\n\nResponse:",
