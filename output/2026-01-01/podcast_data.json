According to a new Morgan Stanley analysis reported by the Financial Times, more than 200,000 European banking jobs could vanish by 2030 as lenders lean into AI and shutter physical branches. That\u2019s roughly 10% of the workforce at 35 major banks.\nThe bloodletting will hit hardest in back-office operations, risk management, and compliance, the unglamorous guts of banking where algorithms are believed capable of tearing through spreadsheets faster and more effectively than humans. Banks are salivating over projected efficiency gains of 30%, according to the Morgan Stanley report.\nThe downsizing isn\u2019t confined to Europe. Goldman Sachs had warned U.S. employees in October of job cuts and a hiring freeze through the end of 2025 as part of an AI push dubbed \u201cOneGS 3.0\u201d that\u2019s targeting everything from client onboarding to regulatory reporting.\nSome institutions are already swinging the axe. Dutch lender ABN Amro plans to cut a fifth of its staff by 2028, while Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s CEO has declared \u201cnothing is sacred.\u201d Still, some European banking leaders are urging caution, with a JPMorgan Chase exec telling the FT that if junior bankers never learn the fundamentals, it could come back to haunt the industry.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI bets big on audio as Silicon Valley declares war on screens\ndescription1:\nOpenAI is betting big on audio AI, and it\u2019s not just about making ChatGPT sound better. According to new reporting from The Information, the company has unified several engineering, product, and research teams over the past two months to overhaul its audio models, all in preparation for an audio-first personal device expected to launch in about a year.\nThe move reflects where the entire tech industry is headed \u2014 toward a future where screens become background noise and audio takes center stage. Smart speakers have already made voice assistants a fixture in more than a third of U.S. homes. Meta just rolled out a feature for its Ray-Ban smart glasses that uses a five-microphone array to help you hear conversations in noisy rooms \u2014 essentially turning your face into a directional listening device. Google, meanwhile, began experimenting in June with \u201cAudio Overviews\u201d that transform search results into conversational summaries, and Tesla is integrating xAI\u2019s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to create a conversational voice assistant that handles everything from navigation to climate control through natural dialogue.\nIt\u2019s not just the tech giants placing this bet. A motley crew of startups has emerged with the same conviction, albeit with varying degrees of success. The makers of the Humane AI Pin burned through hundreds of millions before their screenless wearable became a cautionary tale. The Friend AI pendant, a necklace that claims it will record your life and offer companionship, has sparked privacy concerns and existential dread in equal measure. And now at least two companies, including Sandbar and one helmed by Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky, are building AI rings expected to debut in 2026, allowing wearers to literally talk to the hand.\nThe form factors may differ, but the thesis is the same: audio is the interface of the future. Every space \u2014 your home, your car, even your face \u2014 is becoming a control surface.\nOpenAI\u2019s new audio model, slated for early 2026, will reportedly sound more natural, handle interruptions like an actual conversation partner, and even speak while you\u2019re talking, which is something today\u2019s models can\u2019t manage. The company is also said to envision a family of devices, possibly including glasses or screenless smart speakers, that act less like tools and more like companions.\nNone of this is hugely surprising. As The Information notes, former Apple design chief Jony Ive, who joined OpenAI\u2019s hardware efforts through the company\u2019s $6.5 billion acquisition in May of his firm io, has made reducing device addiction a priority, seeing audio-first design as a chance to \u201cright the wrongs\u201d of past consumer gadgets.\n\ntitle2:\nA guide to choosing the right Apple Watch\ndescription2:\nThis year, Apple released three new Apple Watch models: the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3, and Apple Watch Ultra 3. Whether you\u2019re looking to get one for yourself, buying a last-minute holiday gift, or exploring the different models, we can help point you in the right direction.\nWith its $799 price tag, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is clearly aimed at a niche, high-end market and athletes. For most consumers, the purchasing decision likely lies between the Apple Watch SE 3 and the Apple Watch Series 11, starting at $249 and $399, respectively.\nDespite its lower price tag, the Apple Watch SE 3 comes with much of the same software as the Series 11. If you\u2019re looking for a straightforward smartwatch with essential features like step counting and sleep tracking, the SE 3 is an excellent and affordable choice.\nWhile the Series 11 and Ultra 3 offer modest improvements over their predecessors, the SE 3 has received a significant upgrade from the SE 2. The smartwatch jumps from the S8 chip to the S10 and now features an always-on display, supports fast charging, offers better crack resistance, introduces new health features, includes a wrist-temperature sensor for advanced sleep tracking and retrospective ovulation insights, and more.\nImage Credits:Apple\nAlthough it\u2019s not as flashy as the Series 11 and Ultra 3, it definitely stands out and packs great value, especially for first-time buyers and younger users. The gap between the standard and budget smart watches has never felt smaller.\nOf course, if you want access to more advanced health features, better battery life, and a larger display, the Series 11 would be the better option for your needs. But, it\u2019s worth comparing both models because the SE 3 might be all you need.\nWe\u2019ll walk you through the similarities and differences between the two smart watches to help inform your decision.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

In the initial aftermath of the acquisition, as users fretted over what direction Twitter would take, millions of users hopped over to Mastodon, a fellow microblogging site. As time went on, users would also try out Bluesky, or Instagram\u2019s Threads app \u2014 but because Mastodon was founded in 2016, it had years to develop its own identity as more than just an alternate Twitter.\nWhat is Mastodon?\nMastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.\nMastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a blockchain way), describing itself as a \u201cfederated network which operates in a similar way to email.\u201d\nWhen you first create your account, you choose a server \u2014 similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever \u2014 which generates your profile\u2019s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it\u2019s an unsavory group), which would mean you can\u2019t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.\nThe Mastodon lingo\nMastodon users generally refer to individual communities as \u201cinstances\u201d or servers. These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.\nChoosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it\u2019s possible to move your account later, so don\u2019t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they\u2019re on.\nYou may also hear Mastodon described as part of the \u201cFediverse,\u201d or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn\u2019t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nYou may ocassionally see Mastodon\u2019s equivalent of tweets being referred to as \u201ctoots,\u201d but this is fading out of favor (since it\u2019s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them \u201cposts\u201d these days, but \u201ctoot\u201d is often found referenced in older third-party clients.\nMastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. For a while, Mastodon made an intentional choice not to make a quote tweet-like feature, since it can encourage dogpiling criticism, but the platform relented and rolled out that feature in 2025.\nIn addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you\u2019re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox \u2014 just remember to change the visibility settings if you want that message to stay between the two of you.\nWhat does it mean that Mastodon is open source?\nAnyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server \u2014 plus, the developers of the platform don\u2019t own the copyright.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that you can grab Mastodon\u2019s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s social media platform, Truth Social, initially launched with Mastodon code and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon did not take kindly to that.\nHow do you create a Mastodon account?\nWhen you arrive on the Mastodon website, you can click a button called \u201ccreate account,\u201d which directs you to a page listing servers to choose from. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join \u2014 if it\u2019s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they\u2019re registered via your same server.\nIn effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon made changes amid the \u201cTwitter exodus\u201d so that it would easier to create an account. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.\nHow do you decide which Mastodon server to join?\nMastodon\u2019s website has helpful resources \u2014 but it\u2019s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always change your server affiliation later once you get into the swing of things.\nCan you talk to people on other Mastodon servers besides your own?\nYes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can\u2019t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Home, Local and Federated timelines?\nYour Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on \u201cSlow Mode\u201d in Preferences \u2013> Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)\nWhat is Mastodon\u2019s moderation policy?\nIndividual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.\nWhat are the drawbacks of Mastodon when compared with Twitter/X?\nMastodon\u2019s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter\u2019s user base. It\u2019s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn\u2019t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.\nWhat are the benefits of Mastodon compared with Twitter/X?\nWell, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk\u2026 however, it\u2019s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same \u201cwatercooler of the world\u201d vibe that Twitter was defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to X, though, as it\u2019s more customizable by nature. Unlike X, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.\nIs Mastodon safer than Twitter?\nMastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it \u2014 if you\u2019d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching \u201cred sox\u201d if you haven\u2019t tagged it.\nHowever, a text-based search can surface the posts you\u2019ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.\nCan I post images and video?\nAs noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social \u201cSpaces,\u201d plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental \u201cStatus\u201d tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.\nYou can add up to four images to a post, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.\nCan I post privately to friends?\nMastodon offers the ability to set your post\u2019s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you\u2019ve mentioned.\nCan I get verified on Mastodon?\nNo. There\u2019s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=\u201dme\u201d) in order to prove you are who you say you are.\nSome servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion. For example, the mstdn.social server lets you add blue-and-white checkmarks and other emoji to your display name if you\u2019d like, which make you look verified, even though these don\u2019t mean anything. (Sort of like Twitter\u2019s new verification system! But for free!)\nIs Mastodon here to stay?\nAs of summer 2025, Mastodon has under one million monthly active users, and around 10 million registered users \u2014 this is to say, Mastodon is much smaller than X which had an estimated 132 million daily active users. Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about TTRPGs in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you\u2019ll just ride out the Muskening on X, or switch to Bluesky, Threads, or something else entirely. Choose your own adventure!\nI\u2019m not sure I want to leave X. Can I cross-post from X to Mastodon?\nYes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We\u2019ve had success with Moa Party, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including Mastodon Twitter Crossposter, which is also available here on GitHub.\nCan I find my Twitter friends on Mastodon?\nYes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We\u2019ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like Fedifinder, Twitodon and Debirdify, for example.\nDoes Mastodon work with Bluesky and Threads?\nIt\u2019s a no for Bluesky \u2014 not unless Bluesky chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. But Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, having decided to build its own networking protocol. There is some skepticism among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky\u2019s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol\u2019s advantages or if it\u2019s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.\nThere are many existing protocols for decentralizing discourse, including ActivityPub, SSB, Matrix, & RSS. Each of these are successful in their own right, but none of them fully met the goals we had for a network that enables global long-term public conversations at scale. \u2014 Bluesky (@bluesky) April 6, 2022\nThreads, however, supports ActivityPub. Users on Threads can choose to share their posts with other Activity Pub servers, including Mastodon.\n\ntitle4:\nThe top 6 media/entertainment startups from Disrupt Startup Battlefield\ndescription4:\nEvery year, TechCrunch\u2019s Startup Battlefield pitch contest draws thousands of applicants.
