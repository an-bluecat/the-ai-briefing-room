Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The Trump administration has been looking for ways to stop the flow of federal money appropriated by Congress, including hastily ordering a confusing spending freeze, which experts say violates the Constitution.\nReuters also reported Friday that Musk aides have \u201clocked career civil servants out of computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of federal employees,\u201d citing two unnamed agency officials. Leaked documents obtained by Wired show Musk\u2019s staff have taken over the General Services Administration, a government agency that manages federal offices and technology.\nAcross the government, tech workers are being grilled and subjected to code reviews by Musk aides, Wired reported Thursday. Musk and his team also appear to have been involved in a recent government-wide email offering employees the chance to resign.\nMusk\u2019s disruption of the federal government so far tracks closely to the chaotic days following his takeover of Twitter, as detailed by books like \u201cCharacter Limit\u201d and other reporting from the time.\nIt represents an unprecedented power grab within the U.S. government, and one that directly contradicts the original stated purpose of DOGE. When Donald Trump first announced it in November after he won the election, the idea was to set up DOGE as an entity outside the federal government that would make recommendations on where to cut spending.\nThat\u2019s not what happened.\nAfter his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order that renamed the U.S. Digital Service to the \u201cU.S. DOGE service,\u201d meaning Musk is now working inside the government. He reportedly has an office in the West Wing of the White House, but is also apparently sleeping at the DOGE office, according to Wired.\nThis article has been updated to include a new report by Wired that Elon Musk\u2019s staff have also infiltrated the General Service Administration.\n\ntitle1:\nChina's DeepSeek has some big AI claims; not all experts are convinced\ndescription1:\nDado Ruvic | Reuters\nChinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek rocked markets this week with claims its new AI model outperforms OpenAI's and cost a fraction of the price to build. The assertions \u2014 specifically that DeepSeek's large language model cost just $5.6 million to train \u2014 have sparked concerns over the eyewatering sums that tech giants are currently spending on computing infrastructure required to train and run advanced AI workloads. Investor fears over DeepSeek's disruptive impact erased close to $600 billion from Nvidia's market capitalization Monday \u2014 the biggest single-day drop for any company in U.S. history. But not everyone is convinced by DeepSeek's claims. CNBC asked industry experts for their views on DeepSeek, and how it actually compares to OpenAI, creator of viral chatbot ChatGPT which sparked the AI revolution.\nWhat is DeepSeek?\nLast week, DeepSeek released R1, its new reasoning model that rivals OpenAI's o1. A reasoning model is a large language model that breaks prompts down into smaller pieces and considers multiple approaches before generating a response. It is designed to process complex problems in a similar way to humans. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of AI-focused quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, to focus on large language models and reaching artificial general intelligence, or AGI. AGI as a concept loosely refers to the idea of an AI that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks.\nMuch of the technology behind R1 isn't new. What is notable, however, is that DeepSeek is the first to deploy it in a high-performing AI model with \u2014 according to the company \u2014 considerable reductions in power requirements. \"The takeaway is that there are many possibilities to develop this industry. The high-end chip/capital intensive way is one technological approach,\" said Xiaomeng Lu, director of Eurasia Group's geo-technology practice. \"But DeepSeek proves we are still in the nascent stage of AI development and the path established by OpenAI may not be the only route to highly capable AI.\"\nHow is it different from OpenAI?\nDeepSeek has two main systems that have garnered buzz from the AI community: V3, the large language model that unpins its products, and R1, its reasoning model. Both models are open-source, meaning their underlying code is free and publicly available for other developers to customize and redistribute. DeepSeek's models are much smaller than many other large language models. V3 has a total of 671 billion parameters, or variables that the model learns during training. And while OpenAI doesn't disclose parameters, experts estimate its latest model to have at least a trillion. In terms of performance, DeepSeek says its R1 model achieves performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 on reasoning tasks, citing benchmarks including AIME 2024, Codeforces, GPQA Diamond, MATH-500, MMLU and SWE-bench Verified.\nwatch now\nIn a technical report, the company said its V3 model had a training cost of only $5.6 million \u2014 a fraction of the billions of dollars that notable Western AI labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic have spent to train and run their foundational AI models. It isn't yet clear how much DeepSeek costs to run, however. If the training costs are accurate, though, it means the model was developed at a fraction of the cost of rival models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others. Daniel Newman, CEO of tech insight firm The Futurum Group, said these developments suggest \"a massive breakthrough,\" although he shed some doubt on the exact figures. \"I believe the breakthroughs of DeepSeek indicate a meaningful inflection for scaling laws and are a real necessity,\" he said. \"Having said that, there are still a lot of questions and uncertainties around the full picture of costs as it pertains to the development of DeepSeek.\"\nMeanwhile, Paul Triolio, senior VP for China and technology policy lead at advisory firm DGA Group, noted it was difficult to draw a direct comparison between DeepSeek's model cost and that of major U.S. developers. \"The 5.6 million figure for DeepSeek V3 was just for one training run, and the company stressed that this did not represent the overall cost of R&D to develop the model,\" he said. \"The overall cost then was likely significantly higher, but still lower than the amount spent by major US AI companies.\" DeepSeek wasn't immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nComparing DeepSeek, OpenAI on price\nDeepSeek and OpenAI both disclose pricing for their models' computations on their websites. DeepSeek says R1 costs 55 cents per 1 million tokens of inputs \u2014 \"tokens\" referring to each individual unit of text processed by the model \u2014 and $2.19 per 1 million tokens of output. In comparison, OpenAI's pricing page for o1 shows the firm charges $15 per 1 million input tokens and $60 per 1 million output tokens. For GPT-4o mini, OpenAI's smaller, low-cost language model, the firm charges 15 cents per 1 million input tokens.\nSkepticism over chips\nDeepSeek's reveal of R1 has already led to heated public debate over the veracity of its claim \u2014 not least because its models were built despite export controls from the U.S. restricting the use of advanced AI chips to China. DeepSeek claims it had its breakthrough using mature Nvidia clips, including H800 and A100 chips, which are less advanced than the chipmaker's cutting-edge H100s, which can't be exported to China. However, in comments to CNBC last week, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, said he believed DeepSeek used the banned chips \u2014 a claim that DeepSeek denies.\nwatch now\nNvidia has since come out and said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export-compliant.\nThe real deal or not?\nIndustry experts seem to broadly agree that what DeepSeek has achieved is impressive, although some have urged skepticism over some of the Chinese company's claims. \"DeepSeek is legitimately impressive, but the level of hysteria is an indictment of so many,\" U.S. entrepreneur Palmer Luckey, who founded Oculus and Anduril wrote on X. \"The $5M number is bogus. It is pushed by a Chinese hedge fund to slow investment in American AI startups, service their own shorts against American titans like Nvidia, and hide sanction evasion.\" Seena Rejal, chief commercial officer of NetMind, a London-headquartered startup that offers access to DeepSeek's AI models via a distributed GPU network, said he saw no reason not to believe DeepSeek. \"Even if it's off by a certain factor, it still is coming in as greatly efficient,\" Rejal told CNBC in a phone interview earlier this week. \"The logic of what they've explained is very sensible.\" However, some have claimed DeepSeek's technology might not have been built from scratch. \"DeepSeek makes the same mistakes O1 makes, a strong indication the technology was ripped off,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla said on X, without giving more details. It's a claim that OpenAI itself has alluded to, telling CNBC in a statement Wednesday that it is reviewing reports DeepSeek may have \"inappropriately\" used output data from its models to develop their AI model, a method referred to as \"distillation.\" \"We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the U.S. government to protect the most capable models being built here,\" an OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC.\nCommoditization of AI\nHowever the scrutiny surrounding DeepSeek shakes out, AI scientists broadly agree it marks a positive step for the industry. Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta , said that DeepSeek's success represented a victory for open-source AI models, not necessarily a win for China over the U.S. Meta is behind a popular open-source AI model called Llama. \"To people who see the performance of DeepSeek and think: 'China is surpassing the US in AI.' You are reading this wrong. The correct reading is: 'Open source models are surpassing proprietary ones',\" he said in a post on LinkedIn. \"DeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta). They came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people's work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.\" WATCH: Why DeepSeek is putting America's AI lead in jeopardy\nwatch now\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle offers 'voluntary' buyouts to hardware and platform teams\ndescription2:\nGoogle is offering buyouts to employees in its \"Platforms and Devices\" unit ahead of expected cuts.\nThat unit includes more than 25,000 full-time employees who work on Android, Chrome, ChromeOS, Google Photos, Google One, Pixel, Fitbit and Nest, according to internal documents reviewed by CNBC. The voluntary exit enrollment applies to full-time employees in the U.S. It's unclear how many of the unit's full-time workers are based in the U.S.\n\"This gives eligible P&D Googlers in my direct-reporting org the ability to voluntarily leave the company with a severance package,\" wrote Rick Osterloh, senior vice president of Platforms and Devices, in a memo to employees Thursday that was viewed by CNBC.\nThe buyouts are a signal of expected cuts within Google as it continues prioritizing artificial intelligence. In October, new CFO Anat Ashkenazi said one of her top priorities would be to drive more cost cutting as Google expands its spending on AI infrastructure in 2025.\n\"Any organization can always push a little further and I'll be looking at additional opportunities,\" she said, referring to cost cutting.\nA Google spokesperson confirmed the buyout program to CNBC, saying it comes after the company combined its Android and Pixel divisions last April.\n\"There's tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe \"voluntary exit plan\" may be a fit for employees who are struggling to meet the demands of their jobs, the unit's hybrid work environment or whose passions don't align with the division's mission and goal, Osterloh said. The program is the \"right next step\" for the unit as it aims to \"operate with more efficiency and velocity,\" Osterloh added.\nEmployees have until Feb. 20 to enroll in the exit program. Those who volunteer will find out whether they've been accepted on March 25, a memo states.\n\ntitle3:\nAtlassian closes at highest since 2022 on strong earnings, outlook\ndescription3:\nAtlassian shares popped 14.9% after the software company blew past Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and guidance expectations.\nThe stock hit a fresh 52-week high and closed at its highest level since April 2022. It was also the stock's best day since November.\nAdjusted earnings came in at 96 cents per share, ahead of the 76 cents per share projected by analysts polled by LSEG. Atlassian reported revenues of $1.29 billion, versus the $1.24 billion estimate.\nFor the third quarter, Atlassian said it anticipates $1.35 billion in revenue, above the $1.31 billion LSEG estimate and previous guidance.\nAtlassian benefited from robust cloud and data center growth during the period as more customers turned to artificial intelligence solutions. That contributed to 30% subscription revenue growth over the prior year. Atlassian also said it now expects 26.5% cloud growth and 21.5% data center growth for the fiscal year.\n\ntitle4:\nSamsung flags chip slowdown as profit drops sharply from previous quarter\ndescription4:\nSamsung Electronics on Friday reported that its operating profit dropped sharply from the previous three months as it ramps up R&D spending, while flagging a slowdown in its chips business.\nThe South Korean company posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue, though its operating profit missed expectations.\nHere are Samsung's fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:\nRevenue : 75.8 trillion Korean won ($52.2 billion) vs. KRW 75.4 trillion\n: 75.8 trillion Korean won ($52.2 billion) vs. KRW 75.4 trillion Operating profit: KRW 6.5 trillion vs. KRW 6.8 trillion\nRevenue rose about 12% from last year, while operating profit grew about 130%, year on year. However, operating profit fell nearly 30%, and revenue slipped by over 4%, quarter on quarter, amid soft market conditions and an increase in company expenditures.\nFourth-quarter revenue beat Samsung's own guidance of KRW 75 trillion, while operating profit came in line with the company's forecast.\nSamsung is a leading manufacturer of memory chips, which are utilized in devices such as laptops and servers, and is also the world's second-largest player in the smartphone market.\n\"Although fourth quarter revenue and operating profit decreased on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, annual revenue reached the second-highest on record, surpassed only in 2022,\" Samsung said in its statement.\nFor the full year, Samsung reported KRW 300.9 trillion in revenue and KRW 32.7 trillion in operating profit. In 2023, the company posted an annual revenue of KRW 258.94 trillion and an operating profit of KRW 6.57 trillion.\nFor the current quarter, Samsung said that earnings might be limited due to weakness in its semiconductor business but that it would pursue growth through AI smartphones and other premium devices.\n\"For 2025 as a whole, the Company plans to enhance technological and product advantages in AI, continue to meet future demand for high-value-added products and drive sales growth in premium segments,\" it added.\nSamsung shares fell 2.2% in South Korea on Friday morning, while SK Hynix stock fell over 11% as South Korean markets resumed trading after a four-day break. Asian tech majors have faced pressure from the latest artificial intelligence model from China's DeepSeek that threatens to upend the U.S.-led AI ecosystem.\"\n\nResponse:",
