Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

On Monday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the launch of Meta Compute, a new initiative designed to bolster the tech giant\u2019s AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg said the company intended to drastically expand its energy footprint in the coming years.\n\u201cMeta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time. How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads.\nFor reference, a gigawatt is a measurement of electrical power equivalent to a billion watts. The energy-hungry AI business means that America\u2019s electrical consumption could spike exponentially over the next decade (from 5 GW to 50, according to one estimate).\nZuckerberg has named three executives that he says will be spearheading the new project. One of those people is Santosh Janardhan, the company\u2019s head of global infrastructure. Janardhan, who has been with the company since 2009, will lead work on \u201ctechnical architecture, software stack, silicon program, developer productivity, and building and operating our global datacenter fleet and network,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\nAlso involved is Daniel Gross, who joined the company just last year. Gross is the co-founder of Safe Superintelligence, along with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever. Zuckerberg said that Gross would be leading a new group within Meta that is \u201cresponsible for long-term capacity strategy, supplier partnerships, industry analysis, planning, and business modeling.\u201d\nFinally, Zuckerberg said that Dina Powell McCormick, a former government official who recently joined Meta as the company\u2019s president and vice chairman, would be responsible for working with governments to help \u201cbuild, deploy, invest in, and finance Meta\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThere\u2019s obviously a race to build out generative AI-ready cloud environments, and Capex projections announced last year showed most of Meta\u2019s peers had similar ambitions. Microsoft has been busy partnering with AI infrastructure providers wherever it can, and in December, Google parent company Alphabet announced the acquisition of data center firm Intersect. TechCrunch reached out to Meta for more information about the new initiative.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI buys tiny health records startup Torch for, reportedly, $100M\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI announced it has acquired a tiny startup called Torch for an undisclosed sum. An unnamed source told The Information that OpenAI paid $100 million worth of equity for the startup. Torch\u2019s four-person team is joining OpenAI, both companies said.\nTorch was working on an app that combined all of a person\u2019s medical information for AI use from a range of sources such as doctor visits, lab tests, wearables, and other portals, including consumer wellness tests and the like. The Torch team called their tech \u201ca medical memory for AI, unifying scattered records into a context engine.\u201d\nThe Torch team met when they worked at Forward Health, Torch co-founder Ilya Abyzov said in a post on X. Forward was known for its AI-powered doctors\u2019 offices. It abruptly shut down in late 2024 after raising over $400 million.\nThis acqui-hire means a different fate. The team and its tech will be part of OpenAI\u2019s newly announced ChatGPT Health, a service for people using the chatbot to analyze and manage their health.\n\ntitle2:\nWhy Amazon bought Bee, an AI wearable\ndescription2:\nSmart rings, smart screens, smart TVs, smart pins, smart \u2026 ice cube makers? Sure, why not! AI was everywhere at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where companies large and small were showing off how they\u2019re bringing AI to more devices. For Amazon, CES was a time to show off its newest acquisition in the space: Bee, an AI device that can be worn as a clip-on pin or a bracelet.\nAmazon already has an entry in the AI consumer devices space with Alexa, whose upgraded AI-powered version, Alexa+, can run on 97% of the hardware devices Amazon has shipped. However, with Bee, the company is gaining access to a wearable that could extend its reach outside the home.\nLargely designed for recording conversations like interviews, meetings, or classes, Bee also works as an AI companion. The AI has access to world knowledge, and it learns more about you from a combination of your recordings and the services you permit it to access like Gmail, Google Calendar, your phone\u2019s contacts, and Apple Health.\nGiven that Amazon has already tried integrating Alexa into wearables like earbuds and glasses, it could seem like the company is muddying the waters with the addition of another AI companion. However, those earlier Alexa devices have not taken off in the face of competition like Apple\u2019s AirPods and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. Amazon seems to understand this, which is why it\u2019s adding Bee to its lineup.\n\u201cWe see each other as complementary friends,\u201d says Bee co-founder Maria de Lourdes Zollo of Bee\u2019s relationship with Alexa, in an interview at CES last week. \u201cBee has the understanding of outside the house, and Alexa has the understanding of inside the house. Of course, there will be a future where these two things come together.\u201d\nThat future doesn\u2019t yet mean Bee\u2019s AI will be replaced by Alexa. Noted Amazon Alexa VP Daniel Rausch, Amazon thinks what the team at Bee created is an \u201cimportant and lovable experience.\u201d He describes Bee as a \u201cdeeply engaging and personal\u201d AI, but he also agreed that, at some point, Alexa and Bee would come together.\n\u201cWe know that it will create even more benefit for customers than what [the AI experiences] do on their own,\u201d Rausch explained. \u201cWhen you have access to the power of these AI experiences with you throughout the day, and they\u2019re continuous \u2014 we\u2019re gonna be able to do so much more for customers.\u201d\nDe Lourdes Zollo said that Bee learns from its users, gaining an understanding of their patterns, insights, and commitments, which can help it to suggest to-do items and follow-ups throughout your day.\nEarly use cases have included students who record lectures, elderly people who have trouble remembering things, and people who speak for a living and don\u2019t want to always take notes manually.\n\u201cThey just want a place to have all the summarization of everything they said,\u201d Bee\u2019s co-founder said. \u201cSo based on that, we build a really big graph of knowledge [about] you, where you can go chat with Bee, and have an understanding of what happened to you, but also how you\u2019re changing during the course of your life,\u201d de Lourdes Zollo added.\nSimilar to Alexa, Bee uses a combination of AI models under the hood, but it\u2019s exploring adding Amazon\u2019s AI as one in the mix. After transcribing the conversation, Bee discards the audio, making it impractical for many work-related use cases where you need to play back the conversation to ensure accuracy.\nThere\u2019s still much ahead for Bee in 2026, de Lourdes Zollo teased, without giving anything away. In addition to recent announcements of new features and functionality \u2014 like voice notes, templates, daily insights, and more \u2014 the founder said the eight-person team is working on \u201cmany new things\u201d out of their HQ in San Francisco, where Amazon already has a large number of hardware and Alexa employees.\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s endless possibilities now, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re really excited to be part of Amazon,\u201d she said.\n\ntitle3:\nMore than 100 new tech unicorns were minted in 2025 - here they are\ndescription3:\nWith AI igniting an investor frenzy, every month, more startups obtain unicorn status.\nUsing data from Crunchbase and PitchBook, TechCrunch tracked down the VC-backed startups that became unicorns in 2025.

But Anthropic\u2019s product promises more sophistication than ChatGPT Health, which seems as though it will be more focused on a patient-side chat experience as it rolls out gradually.\nThough some industry professionals are concerned about the role of hallucination-prone LLMs in offering clients medical advice, Anthropic\u2019s \u201cagent skills\u201d seem promising.\nClaude has added what it calls \u201cconnectors\u201d to give the AI access to platforms and databases that can speed up research processes and report generation for payers and providers, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Coverage Database; the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10); the National Provider Identifier Standard; and PubMed.\nAnthropic explained in a blog post that Claude for Health could use its connectors to speed up prior authorization review, the process in which a doctor must submit additional information to an insurance provider to see if it will cover a medication or treatment.\n\u201cClinicians often report spending more time on documentation and paperwork than actually seeing patients,\u201d Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger said in a presentation about the product.\nFor doctors, submitting prior authorization documents is more of an administrative task than something that requires their specialized training and expertise. It\u2019s something that makes more sense to automate than the actual process of administering medical advice \u2026 though Claude will do that as well.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.
