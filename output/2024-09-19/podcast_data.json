Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday September 20), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTesla, Nvidia lead tech stocks to one of best days of 2024 on rate cut\ndescription0:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents the Nvidia Blackwell platform at an event ahead of the COMPUTEX Forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024.\nInvestors poured into tech stocks at one of the fastest clips of the year a day after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2020.\nLed by a 7.4% gain in shares of Tesla and a 4% jump in Nvidia , the Nasdaq rose 2.5% on Thursday, its fourth-sharpest rally of 2024. The biggest gain of the year for the tech-heavy index was a 3% increase on Feb. 22.\nLower interest rates tend to benefit tech stocks because reduced borrowing costs and bond yields make risky bets more attractive. In addition to the central bank's half-point reduction, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated through its \"dot plot\" the equivalent of 50 more basis points of cuts by the end of the year, eventually coming down by 2 percentage points beyond Wednesday's move.\nWhile the Nasdaq has been on a steady rise this year, powered by Nvidia and the enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, Thursday's rally pushed the benchmark to its highest since mid-July. The Nasdaq peaked at 18,647.45 on July 10, and it is now just 3.5% shy of that level, closing at 18,013.98.\nNvidia, whose processors are powering the generative AI boom and services such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, gained 4% on Thursday to $117.87. The shares are up about 138% for the year after more than tripling in 2023, though they are still 13% below their all-time high reached in June.\nNvidia counts on a relatively small group of customers \u2014 namely Microsoft , Meta , Alphabet , Amazon , Oracle and OpenAI \u2014 for an outsized amount of revenue because those are the companies either developing large language models, hosting big AI workloads or doing both. Any sign of slackening demand creates concern around Nvidia's stock.\nBut lower rates are seen as another potential boon.\nFellow chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom also rallied big on Thursday, gaining 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively. AMD is trying to challenge Nvidia in the AI market, but it is far behind and has some skeptics on Wall Street. The stock is only up about 6% this year.\nAMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Wednesday that AI is a very long game, and we are at the early stages.\n\"Let's not be impatient. Tech trends are meant to play out over years, not over months,\" Su said. \"We've only been in this, let's call it, ChatGPT world for maybe like 18 months. We're all learning. It's fun. We all use it.\"\nSu said AI is going to make its way into \"all aspects of our lives,\" including education and drug development.\n\"The beauty of all this is you need the computing, and that's what we do,\" Su said.\nTesla was the biggest gainer among tech's megacap companies on Thursday, gaining 7.4%. The electric car maker has been a relative laggard for the year, down almost 2%, compared to the Nasdaq's 20% gain. However, Tesla is up 72% from its low for the year in April.\nAmong the other top tech companies, Apple and Meta also closed with big gains, each rising almost 4%.\n\ntitle1:\nApple's new macOS Sequoia update is breaking some cybersecurity tools\ndescription1:\nOn Monday, Apple released its latest computer operating system update called macOS 15, or Sequoia. And, somehow, the software update has broken the functionality of several security tools made by CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, Microsoft, and others, according to posts on social media, as well as messages posted in a Mac-focused Slack channel.\nAt this point, it\u2019s unclear exactly what is the issue, but it appears to affect several products made by companies that provide software for macOS users and enterprises, which has caused frustration among people who work on and with macOS-focused security tools.\n\u201cAs a developer of macOS security tools, it\u2019s incredibly frustrating to time and time again have to deal with (understandably) upset users (understandably) blaming your tools for breaking their Macs, when in reality it was Apple\u2019s fault all along,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, the founder of Mac and iOS security startup DoubleYou, and a longtime expert on macOS security.\n\u201cI get it, that writing bug-free software is challenging, but maybe if Apple spent less time and money on marketing, and more time on actually testing their software, we\u2019d all be better off!\u201d Wardle told TechCrunch.\nOn the day of macOS Sequoia\u2019s release, a CrowdStrike sales engineer said in a Slack room for Mac admins that the company had to delay support for the new version of Mac\u2019s operating system. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry to report that we will not be supporting Sequoia on day 1 in spite of our intention (and previous track record) to support the latest OS within hours of [General Availability],\u201d the engineer said in the message, seen by TechCrunch.\nThe engineer also said CrowdStrike sent out a \u201cTech Alert\u201d to customers, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s quite a lot going on with the changes in the network stack.\u201d\n\u201dWe\u2019re also tracking some similar issues with other vendors, and have feedback and a case in to Apple. While we would love for there to be a fast-follow patch that resolves this for us, we\u2019re acting under the assumption there won\u2019t be and we\u2019ll need to fix it in our code with a sensor release,\u201d the sales engineer wrote.\nContact Us Do you work at a cybersecurity company whose products are affected by the macOS update? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you work at a cybersecurity company whose products are affected by the macOS update? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email . You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\n\u201cPlease trust me when I say this was looked at through every angle, to see if there was any way to continue to provide the best protection to our customers on this new OS without having to delay,\u201d the CrowdStrike engineer wrote. \u201cUltimately it was decided that the best course to protect our Mac fleets is to wait until this is resolved.\u201d\nAlso, several people on Reddit reported having issues with CrowdStrike\u2019s security product on the new macOS.\nCrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci told TechCrunch on Thursday that the company is \u201ccurrently waiting for a macOS Sequoia update and will provide official support. We respectfully refer you to Apple for any additional questions.\u201d\nApple did not respond to requests for comment.\nOn Monday, a SentinelOne Support account warned customers in the same Mac-focused Slack channel: \u201cDo not upgrade your endpoints until you have a supported SentinelOne Agent,\u201d citing a series of issues with the new macOS version.\nSentinelOne did not respond to a request for comment.\nESET also alerted customers of a network connection issue after upgrading to macOS Sequoia. An ESET representative did not respond to our request for comment.\nOther people in the same Slack reported having issues with Microsoft Defender for macOS after the Sequoia update. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment.\nSecurity researcher Will Dormann wrote on Mastodon that he was having issues with DNS and running his firewall on his macOS machine. Another security researcher, Wac\u0142aw Jacek, wrote in a blog post that, \u201cit seems the OS firewall can sometimes start blocking access to web browsing after upgrading to macOS Sequoia,\u201d and shared a potential workaround.\nThe problems with macOS Sequoia appear to have caused issues with Firefox browser users, too, according to a separate Reddit thread.\n\ntitle2:\nApple Intelligence is now live in public beta. Here\u2019s what it offers and how to enable it.\ndescription2:\nApple Intelligence took another major step toward mainstream availability Thursday with the launch of the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 public betas.\nStarting Thursday, those who are enrolled in Apple\u2019s public beta program will be able to experience the generative AI-fueled platform the company has been talking up since June.\nFor the time being, Apple Intelligence is only available in U.S. English. The feature is also indefinitely unavailable in both the EU and the People\u2019s Republic of China, owing to regulatory hurdles. Those in the States can access the feature with the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and any member of the newly unveiled iPhone 16 line.\nTechCrunch has been putting the developer beta of iOS 18.1 through its paces as part of our iPhone 16 Pro Max review. There are a handful of standout features, including cross-system writing tools, Clean Up for Photos, and the biggest revamp to Siri since launch.\nWriting Tools takes advantage of the kinds of generative AI features familiar to anyone who has played around with ChatGPT and its ilk. Along with proofreading and summarizing, the system will rewrite text in a variety of styles, including professional, concise, and friendly. Over in Mail, users gain a Smart Reply feature, message prioritization, and summaries.\nSiri gets a big face-lift, beginning with how the smart assistant is presented on-screen. Gone is the colorful Siri icon in the bottom of the screen, replaced by illuminated borders that won\u2019t obscure text. Siri can also better understand when you trip over your words, and for instances when you can\u2019t speak to the assistant, you can type instead.\nThe last major Siri feature dropping Thursday is product knowledge, wherein users can ask the assistant how to perform a variety of different on-device tasks, from screen recording to resetting an AirTag. Features like conversational and app context and Visual Intelligence are still on the way.\nOn the Photos front, the most interesting addition is Clean Up, Apple\u2019s answer to Google Magic Eraser. After circling an object with your finger, the tool goes to work removing it by generating a background over it. Search has been improved within the app to accommodate more natural language queries, and users can now generate Memories via a text prompt.\nUsers must manually enable the feature by going to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Join the Apple Intelligence waitlist. Joining the public beta programs, meanwhile, is as simple as visiting beta.apple.com.\nAdditional Apple Intelligence features are set to roll out later this year.\n\ntitle3:\nFTC report on predatory social media data hoarding hints at future regulations\ndescription3:\nA new FTC report on how social media and streaming sites collect and monetize their hoards of user data doesn\u2019t really feature a lot of surprises for anyone who\u2019s followed the space. It\u2019s more helpful to consider this part of a paper trail the agency is laying down in order to justify new regulations in the space.\nThe report has its roots way back in late 2020, when the FTC ordered nine of the tech companies with the biggest data collection apparatus to disclose numerous aspects of how their surveillance capitalism business models worked. (The companies: Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Snap, ByteDance, Discord, Reddit, and WhatsApp.)\nWhat data do you collect, on whom, and how long is it kept? If asked to delete, do you do so? What do you use it for, who do you sell it to, and what do they use it for? The questions are quite comprehensive, the better to avoid the possibility of prevarication or obscuration through withholding of important data.\nThe responses of the companies were, predictably, evasive, as the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection Director Samuel Levine notes in the preface:\nEchoing the way that firms conceal and hide their collection practices, many of the Companies provided the Commission with limited, incomplete, or unhelpful responses that appeared to have been carefully crafted to be self-serving and avoid revealing key pieces of information.\nThe resulting report details all manner of shenanigans, representing both malice and incompetence. Few of the practices disclosed will surprise anyone at this point, but the executive summary starting on page 9 is a great refresher on all the skulduggery we have come to expect from the likes of these.\nOf course, it has been nearly four years since then, and many of the companies have made changes to their practices or have been fined or otherwise chastised. But despite the elevation of Lina Khan to chair of the FTC subsequent to this inquiry, there has been no large revision or expansion of rules that lay down bright lines like \u201cthou shalt not sell data on a user\u2019s health challenges to advertisers.\u201d\nOne exception you might hope for, compliance with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, also seems to be an afterthought. As the FTC writes:\nIn an apparent attempt to avoid liability under the COPPA Rule, most [social media and video streaming services] asserted that there are no child users on their platforms because children cannot create accounts. Yet we know that children are using SMVSSs. The SMVSSs should not ignore this reality. \u2026 Almost all of the Companies allowed teens on their SMVSSs and placed no restrictions on their accounts, and collected personal information from teens just like they do from adults.\nMeta allegedly ignored obvious violations for years; Amazon settled for $25 million after \u201cflouting\u201d the law; TikTok owner ByteDance is the target of a similar lawsuit filed just last month.\nSo what\u2019s the point of the report, if all this is known?\nWell, the FTC has to do its due diligence, too, when considering rules that could restrict a bunch of multi-billion-dollar global tech companies. If the FTC in 2020 had said, \u201cThese companies are out of control, we propose a new rule!\u201d then the industries impacted would quite justifiably challenge it by saying there is no evidence of the kind of practices the rule would prohibit. This kind of thing happened with net neutrality as well: The broadband companies challenged it on (among other things) the basis that the harms were overstated, and won.\nThough Chair Khan\u2019s statement accompanying the report suggests it will help inform state and federal lawmakers\u2019 efforts (which is likely true), it is almost certain that this will provide a foundational fact basis on which to build out a new rulemaking. The very fact that the companies both admit to doing these things, and that they have been caught red-handed doing others in the meantime, would strengthen any argument for new regulations.\nKhan also fends off dissent from within, from Commissioners who (despite voting unanimously to issue the report) accuse it of attempting to regulate speech or dictate business models. She dispatches these arguments with the confidence of someone already drafting a proposal.\nThat proposal (should it exist) would likely be aimed at trimming the wings of those companies that have come to embody entire industries within themselves. As Khan puts it:\nIt is the relative dominance of several of these platforms that gives their decisions and data practices an outsized impact on Americans. When a single firm controls a market and is unchecked by competition, its policies can effectively function as private regulation. A consolidated market is also more susceptible to coordination with \u2014 or cooptation by \u2014 the government. Unchecked private surveillance by these platforms creates heightened risk of improper surveillance by the state. How these markets are structured can result in greater risks to\u2014 or greater protections of \u2014 people\u2019s core liberties.\nIn other words, let\u2019s not leave it to them, and the FTC likely doesn\u2019t intend to.\n\ntitle4:\nElon Musk's X and Starlink face daily fines in Brazil for ban evasion\ndescription4:\nElon Musk's X faces steep daily fines in Brazil for allegedly evading a ban on the service there, according to a statement from the country's supreme court Thursday.\nThe fines imposed by Brazil's supreme court amount to $5 million in Brazilian reals, about $920,000, a day. The court said it would continue to impose \"joint liability\" on Starlink, the satellite internet service owned and operated by SpaceX, Musk's aerospace venture.\nThe suspension of X in Brazil was initially ordered by the country's chief justice, Alexandre de Moraes, at the end of August, with orders upheld by a panel of justices in early September. The court found that under Musk, X had violated Brazilian law, which requires social media companies to employ a legal representative in the country and to remove hate speech and other content deemed harmful to democratic institutions. The court also found that X failed to suspend accounts allegedly engaged in doxxing federal officers.\nX recently moved to servers hosted by Cloudflare and appeared to be using dynamic internet protocol addresses that constantly change, enabling many users in Brazil to access the site. In a previous setup, the company had used static and specific IP addresses in Brazil, which were more easily blocked by internet service providers at the order of regulators.\nMusk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, has been lashing out at de Moraes for months and continued to do so after the order was issued. He's characterized de Moraes as a villain, comparing him to Darth Vader and Harry Potter character Voldemort. He has also repeatedly called for de Moraes to be impeached.\nBrazil previously withdrew money for fines it levied against X from the accounts of X and Starlink at financial institutions in the country. The new fines will begin as of Sept. 19, with the court calculating a total based on \"the number of days of non-compliance\" with its earlier orders to suspend X nationwide.\nWhile Musk presents himself as a free speech absolutist, X has acquiesced to requests to remove profiles and posts in countries including India, Turkey and Hungary.\nMusk and X may be in the process of complying with Brazil's takedown orders as well. Correio Braziliense, a Brazilian publication, reported on Wednesday that X has started blocking accounts as per suspension orders issued by the country's supreme court.\nAmong the apparently banned accounts were those of some internet influencers who are reportedly being investigated for spreading misinformation and promoting attacks against democratic institutions in Brazil.\nX said it wasn't intending to restore access for Brazilian users.\n\"When X was shut down in Brazil, our infrastructure to provide service to Latin America was no longer accessible to our team,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday. \"To continue providing optimal service to our users, we changed network providers. This change resulted in an inadvertent and temporary service restoration to Brazilian users. While we expect the platform to be inaccessible again in Brazil soon, we continue efforts to work with the Brazilian government to return very soon for the people of Brazil.\"\nBrazil's national telecommunication agency, Anatel, has been ordered by de Moraes to prevent access to the platform by blocking Cloudflare as well as Fastly and EdgeUno servers, and others that the court said had been \"created to circumvent\" a suspension of X in Brazil.\nA Cloudflare spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company isn't \"enabling or preventing blocking,\" adding that \"many of Cloudflare's customers choose to use dedicated IPs, which is not unique in the industry.\"\nBefore the suspension, X had an estimated 22 million users in Brazil, according to Data Reportal.\nWATCH: X is a financial 'disaster'\"\n\nResponse:",
