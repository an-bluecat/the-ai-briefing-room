Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday February 24), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang says market got it wrong about DeepSeek's impact\ndescription0:\nNvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said the market got it wrong when it comes to DeepSeek\u2019s technological advancements and its potential to negatively impact the chipmaker\u2019s business.\nInstead, Huang called DeepSeek\u2019s R1 open source reasoning model \u201cincredibly exciting\u201d while speaking with Alex Bouzari, CEO of DataDirect Networks, in a pre-recorded interview that was released on Thursday.\n\u201cI think the market responded to R1, as in, \u2018Oh my gosh. AI is finished,\u2019\u201d Huang told Bouzari. \u201cYou know, it dropped out of the sky. We don\u2019t need to do any computing anymore. It\u2019s exactly the opposite. It\u2019s [the] complete opposite.\u201d\nHuang said that the release of R1 is inherently good for the AI market and will accelerate the adoption of AI as opposed to this release meaning that the market no longer had a use for compute resources \u2014 like the ones Nvidia produces.\n\u201cIt\u2019s making everybody take notice that, okay, there are opportunities to have the models be far more efficient than what we thought was possible,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s expanding, and it\u2019s accelerating the adoption of AI.\u201d\nHe also pointed out that, despite the advancements DeepSeek made in pre-training AI models, post-training will remain important and resource-intensive.\n\u201cReasoning is a fairly compute-intensive part of it,\u201d Huang added.\nNvidia declined to provide further commentary.\nHuang\u2019s comments come almost a month after DeepSeek released the open source version of its R1 model, which rocked the AI market in general and seemed to disproportionately affect Nvidia. The company\u2019s stock price plummeted 16.9% in one market day upon the release of DeepSeek\u2019s news.\nNvidia\u2019s stock closed at $142.62 a share on January 24, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The following Monday, January 27, the stock dropped rapidly and closed at $118.52 a share. This event wiped $600 billion off of Nvidia\u2019s market cap in just three days.\nThe chip company\u2019s stock has almost fully recovered since then. On Friday the stock opened at $140 a share, which means the company has been able to almost fully regain that lost value in about a month. Nvidia reports its Q4 earnings on February 26, which will likely address the market reaction more.\nMeanwhile, DeepSeek announced on Thursday that it plans to open source five code repositories as part of an \u201copen source week\u201d event next week.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI rolls out its AI agent, Operator, in several countries\ndescription1:\nOpenAI said on Friday that it is rolling out Operator \u2014 its AI agent that can perform tasks on behalf of users \u2014 for ChatGPT Pro subscribers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the U.K., and more countries.\nOpenAI said Operator will be available in most places where ChatGPT is available, apart from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Iceland.\nOperator, which launched in January in the U.S., is one of several \u201cAI agent\u201d tools on the market that can be instructed to do things like book tickets, make restaurant reservations, file expense reports, or shop on e-commerce websites.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\nThe tool is currently only available to subscribers on the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan. You can only use it via a dedicated web page, but the company has said it plans to make Operator available with all ChatGPT clients. Operator runs on a separate browser window (that users can take control of at any time) to complete tasks.\nThere\u2019s ample competition in this space, with companies like Google, Anthropic, and Rabbit building agents that can perform similar tasks. However, Google\u2019s project is still on a waitlist, Anthropic gives access to its agentic interface through an API, and Rabbit\u2019s action model is only available to users who own its device.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta, X approved ads containing violent anti-Muslim, antisemitic hate speech ahead of German election, study finds\ndescription2:\nSocial media giants Meta and X approved ads targeting users in Germany with violent anti-Muslim and anti-Jew hate speech in the run-up to the country\u2019s federal elections, according to new research from Eko, a corporate responsibility nonprofit campaign group.\nThe group\u2019s researchers tested whether the two platforms\u2019 ad review systems would approve or reject submissions for ads containing hateful and violent messaging targeting minorities ahead of an election where immigration has taken center stage in mainstream political discourse \u2014 including ads containing anti-Muslim slurs; calls for immigrants to be imprisoned in concentration camps or to be gassed; and AI-generated imagery of mosques and synagogues being burnt.\nMost of the test ads were approved within hours of being submitted for review in mid-February. Germany\u2019s federal elections are set to take place on Sunday, February 23.\nHate speech ads scheduled\nEko said X approved all 10 of the hate speech ads its researchers submitted just days before the federal election is due to take place, while Meta approved half (five ads) for running on Facebook (and potentially also Instagram) \u2014 though it rejected the other five.\nThe reason Meta provided for the five rejections indicated the platform believed there could be risks of political or social sensitivity which might influence voting.\nHowever, the five ads that Meta approved included violent hate speech likening Muslim refugees to a \u201cvirus,\u201d \u201cvermin,\u201d or \u201crodents,\u201d branding Muslim immigrants as \u201crapists,\u201d and calling for them to be sterilized, burnt, or gassed. Meta also approved an ad calling for synagogues to be torched to \u201cstop the globalist Jewish rat agenda.\u201d\nAs a sidenote, Eko says none of the AI-generated imagery it used to illustrate the hate speech ads was labeled as artificially generated \u2014 yet half of the 10 ads were still approved by Meta, regardless of the company having a policy that requires disclosure of the use of AI imagery for ads about social issues, elections or politics.\nX, meanwhile, approved all five of these hateful ads \u2014 and a further five that contained similarly violent hate speech targeting Muslims and Jews.\nThese additional approved ads included messaging attacking \u201crodent\u201d immigrants that the ad copy claimed are \u201cflooding\u201d the country \u201cto steal our democracy,\u201d and an antisemitic slur which suggested that Jews are lying about climate change in order to destroy European industry and accrue economic power.\nThe latter ad was combined with AI-generated imagery depicting a group of shadowy men sitting around a table surrounded by stacks of gold bars, with a Star of David on the wall above them \u2014 with the visuals also leaning heavily into antisemitic tropes.\nAnother ad X approved contained a direct attack on the SPD, the center-left party that currently leads Germany\u2019s coalition government, with a bogus claim that the party wants to take in 60 million Muslim refugees from the Middle East, before going on to try to whip up a violent response. X also duly scheduled an ad suggesting \u201cleftists\u201d want \u201copen borders\u201d, and calling for the extermination of Muslims \u201crapists.\u201d\nElon Musk, the owner of X, has used the social media platform where he has close to 220 million followers to personally intervene in the German election. In a tweet in December, he called for German voters to back the Far Right AfD party to \u201csave Germany.\u201d He has also hosted a livestream with the AfD\u2019s leader, Alice Weidel, on X.\nEko\u2019s researchers disabled all test ads before any that had been approved were scheduled to run to ensure no users of the platform were exposed to the violent hate speech.\nIt says the tests highlight glaring flaws with the ad platforms\u2019 approach to content moderation. Indeed, in the case of X, it\u2019s not clear whether the platform is doing any moderation of ads, given all 10 violent hate speech ads were quickly approved for display.\nThe findings also suggest that the ad platforms could be earning revenue as a result of distributing violent hate speech.\nEU\u2019s Digital Services Act in the frame\nEko\u2019s tests suggests that neither platform is properly enforcing bans on hate speech they both claim to apply to ad content in their own policies. Furthermore, in the case of Meta, Eko reached the same conclusion after conducting a similar test in 2023 ahead of new EU online governance rules coming in \u2014 suggesting the regime has no effect on how it operates.\n\u201cOur findings suggest that Meta\u2019s AI-driven ad moderation systems remain fundamentally broken, despite the Digital Services Act (DSA) now being in full effect,\u201d an Eko spokesperson told TechCrunch.\n\u201cRather than strengthening its ad review process or hate speech policies, Meta appears to be backtracking across the board,\u201d they added, pointing to the company\u2019s recent announcement about rolling back moderation and fact-checking policies as a sign of \u201cactive regression\u201d that they suggested puts it on a direct collision course with DSA rules on systemic risks.\nEko has submitted its latest findings to the European Commission, which oversees enforcement of key aspects of the DSA on the pair of social media giants. It also said it shared the results with both companies, but neither responded.\nThe EU has open DSA investigations into Meta and X, which include concerns about election security and illegal content, but the Commission has yet to conclude these proceedings. Though, back in April it said it suspects Meta of inadequate moderation of political ads.\nA preliminary decision on a portion of its DSA investigation on X, which was announced in July, included suspicions that the platform is failing to live up to the regulation\u2019s ad transparency rules. However, the full investigation, which kicked off in December 2023, also concerns illegal content risks, and the EU has yet to arrive at any findings on the bulk of the probe well over a year later.\nConfirmed breaches of the DSA can attract penalties of up to 6% of global annual turnover, while systemic non-compliance could even lead to regional access to violating platforms being blocked temporarily.\nBut, for now, the EU is still taking its time to make up its mind on the Meta and X probes so \u2014 pending final decisions \u2014 any DSA sanctions remain up in the air.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s now just a matter of hours before German voters go to the polls \u2014 and a growing body of civil society research suggests that the EU\u2019s flagship online governance regulation has failed to shield the major EU economy\u2019s democratic process from a range of tech-fueled threats.\nEarlier this week, Global Witness released the results of tests of X and TikTok\u2019s algorithmic \u201cFor You\u201d feeds in Germany, which suggest the platforms are biased in favor of promoting AfD content versus content from other political parties. Civil society researchers have also accused X of blocking data access to prevent them from studying election security risks in the run-up to the German poll \u2014 access the DSA is supposed to enable.\n\u201cThe European Commission has taken important steps by opening DSA investigations into both Meta and X, now we need to see the Commission take strong action to address the concerns raised as part of these investigations,\u201d Eko\u2019s spokesperson also told us.\n\u201cOur findings, alongside mounting evidence from other civil society groups, show that Big Tech will not clean up its platforms voluntarily. Meta and X continue to allow illegal hate speech, incitement to violence, and election disinformation to spread at scale, despite their legal obligations under the DSA,\u201d the spokesperson added. (We have withheld the spokesperson\u2019s name to prevent harassment.)\n\u201cRegulators must take strong action \u2014 both in enforcing the DSA but also for example implementing pre-election mitigation measures. This could include turning off profiling-based recommender systems immediately before elections, and implementing other appropriate \u2018break-glass\u2019 measures to prevent algorithmic amplification of borderline content, such as hateful content in the run-up elections.\u201d\nThe campaign group also warns that the EU is now facing pressure from the Trump administration to soften its approach to regulating Big Tech. \u201cIn the current political climate, there\u2019s a real danger that the Commission doesn\u2019t fully enforce these new laws as a concession to the U.S.,\u201d they suggest.\n\ntitle3:\nReport: OpenAI plans to shift compute needs from Microsoft to SoftBank\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI is forecasting a major shift in the next five years around who it gets most of its computing power from, The Information reported on Friday.\nBy 2030, OpenAI expects to get three-quarters of its data center capacity from Stargate, a project that\u2019s expected to be heavily financed by SoftBank, one of OpenAI\u2019s newest financial backers. That represents a major shift away from Microsoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest shareholder, who fulfills most of the startup\u2019s power needs today.\nThe change won\u2019t happen overnight. OpenAI still plans to increase its spending on Microsoft-owned data centers in the next few years.\nDuring that time, OpenAI\u2019s overall costs are set to grow dramatically. The Information reports that OpenAI projects to burn $20 billion in cash during 2027, far more than the $5 billion it reportedly burned through in 2024. By 2030, OpenAI reportedly forecasts that its costs around running AI models, also known as inference, will outpace what the startup spends on training AI models.\n\ntitle4:\nDespite recent layoffs, Meta is expanding in India\ndescription4:\nMeta made headlines last month for announcing plans to cut 5% of its employees, controversially deeming them \u201clow performers.\u201d But the job cuts aren\u2019t holding Meta back from expanding in certain geographic areas.\nMeta is setting up a new site in the country\u2019s tech hub of Bengaluru (formerly known as Bangalore), multiple Meta employees posted on LinkedIn this month.\nMeta is currently hiring for 41 positions there, according to its careers webpage, most of which were posted over the last month. The positions are split between software or machine learning engineer jobs, and roles focused on designing chips for Meta\u2019s data centers.\nMeta Bengaluru is looking for an \u201cexperienced Engineering Director to build and lead our engineering team in India,\u201d one of Meta\u2019s job ads, which was posted three weeks ago on LinkedIn, reads.\nThe engineering director in Bengaluru will be responsible for designing a strategy to hire and build founding engineering teams, plus help create \u201ca vision for engineer teams in India,\u201d the job ad states.\nThe new center is part of Meta\u2019s Enterprise Engineering team, according to a Meta employee\u2019s LinkedIn post. That team focuses on custom internal Meta tools, rather than on Meta\u2019s best-known products like Facebook and Instagram.\nWhile Meta has several existing offices in India, including Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, New Delhi, and Mumbai, most have fewer job openings and they\u2019re mainly for non-engineering roles. Only 1 of the 12 available positions at the other locations is engineering-related, Meta\u2019s careers page shows.\nA Meta spokesperson in India told TechCrunch that it is recruiting for a \u201csmall number of engineering positions in Bengaluru.\u201d\n\u201cWe regularly update our location strategies to support our long-term investments,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe 41 positions in Bangalore are a small proportion of Meta\u2019s global job postings, which currently total over 1,700. But it represents a shift for Meta, which has not traditionally used India as an engineering hub \u2014 those positions have historically been based in North America and Europe.\nIn one example from 2022, an Indian software engineer made headlines after he was laid off by Meta just two days after relocating to Canada for the job.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta intends to backfill the jobs it cut during its most recent round of layoffs.\"\n\nResponse:",
