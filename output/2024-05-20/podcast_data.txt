Scarlett Johansson says OpenAI ripped off her voice

Actress Scarlett Johansson says OpenAI CEO Sam Altman used a voice similar to hers for its artificial intelligence voice software despite her decline of his invitation.
The response comes after OpenAI said it would pull its ChatGPT AI voice dubbed "Sky", which launched last week and created controversy for sounding like Johansson's voice in the movie "Her."
Johansson said Altman approached her last September and then again two days before it announced ChatGPT-4o on May 13. Johansson played the voice character in the film "Her" about a man who forms a relationship with a virtual artificial intelligence named Samantha.
"After much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the offer," Johansson said in a statement to CNBC. "Nine months later, my friends, family and the general public all noted how much the newest system named 'Sky' sounded like me."
Altman tweeted the message "her" on the day OpenAI announced its new AI.
"When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference," Johansson's statement continued. "Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word "her"
The actress wrote Monday that she has hired legal counsel. Johansson has sparred with large companies like Disney in the past. In 2021, Johansson and Walt Disney settled the breach of contract lawsuit the "Black Widow" actor brought against the studio.
"We've heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT, especially Sky," Microsoft-backed OpenAI posted on X on Monday.
"Sky's voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice," the company wrote in a blog post on Sunday. "To protect their privacy, we cannot share the names of our voice talents."
Johansson said she wrote two letters to Altman and OpenAI, asking them to detail the process of creating Sky.
"In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity," her statement says. "I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected."
OpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Johansson's statement.
Here is Scarlett Johansson's full statement:
"Last September, I received an offer from Sam Altman, who wanted to hire me to voice the current ChatGPT 4.0 system. He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI. He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.
After much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the offer. Nine months later, my friends, family and the general public all noted how much the newest system named "Sky" sounded like me.
When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference. Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word "her" - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.
Two days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there
As a result of their actions, I was forced to hire legal counsel, who wrote two letters to Mr. Altman and OpenAI, setting out what they had done and asking them to detail the exact process by which they created the "Sky" voice. Consequently, OpenAI reluctantly agreed to take down the "Sky" voice.
In a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity. I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected."

Microsoft announces new PCs with AI chips from Qualcomm
description1:
Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft May 20 Briefing event at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, on May 20, 2024.
Microsoft is touting new computers with advanced chips designed to run artificial intelligence features of software for Windows, without quickly using up battery life.
The company on Monday announced a Surface Laptop and a Surface Pro tablet with a Qualcomm chip that can run some AI tasks without an internet connection. Other computer makers like Lenovo, Dell, HP, Asus, Acer and Samsung are also launching AI-ready PCs powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus processors, which promise longer battery life and will run Microsoft's Copilot AI chatbot.
Device makers will release PCs with AMD and Intel chips that will adhere to the Copilot+ standard at a later time, Microsoft said during a press keynote address on its campus in Redmond, Washington. The PCs will be able to translate audio, recommend responses to incoming messages and suggest changes in the Settings app, and even talk with people about what's on screen.
Copilot+ PCs will start at $999. Microsoft is accepting pre-orders as of Monday, and the devices will become available in June.
A Recall feature will be able to search through a log of previous actions on PCs. Recall relies on AI models that run directly on the device, so it can run offline, and an index of the data never goes to remote servers. AI models will be able to generate images based on written descriptions as well as drawings.
Microsoft is banking on Qualcomm's energy-efficient Arm -based chips that can handle AI models to defend its Windows franchise. Apple has gained market share in PC shipments with MacBooks containing its Arm-based chips, having moved away from Intel , the top provider of computer processors.
Microsoft is expanding its effort to surround consumers and business users with ChatGPT-like capabilities. OpenAI, backed by Microsoft, released the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022, and it took off as a tool for quickly obtaining computer-generated poems, email drafts and summaries of historical events.
Other large technology companies, including Microsoft, soon started augmenting their products with generative AI. A Copilot chatbot drawing on ChatGPT's underlying AI models came to the Bing search engine, along with the Windows 10 and 11 operating systems. Those with Office productivity software subscriptions could pay extra to have a Copilot refer to their documents for written responses.
The GPT-4 model inside ChatGPT has only done its necessary computing work in Microsoft's Azure cloud. The new PCs can run some AI models locally without an internet connection.
The launch comes nearly four months after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call that "in 2024, AI will become a first-class part of every PC."
Microsoft has had little success in getting people to adopt Arm-based Windows computers, which haven't always performed as well as PCs running Intel or AMD chips. Certain applications have been incompatible.
Running generative AI locally means computers will need more power, and strong battery life becomes more critical. That might make Windows on Arm more compelling.
Analysts with Morgan Stanley expect Arm systems to be 14% of all Windows PC shipments in 2026, up from 0% in 2023, according to a note distributed to clients earlier this month.
Microsoft shares closed up 1.2% Monday afternoon to $425.34, just shy of a record reached in March. Qualcomm rose 2% to $197.76 for a record close.

Elon Musk has launched SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet services in Indonesia as the Southeast Asian nation seeks to boost internet connectivity in remote areas.
The inauguration took place at a community health center in Bali on Sunday, with the SpaceX founder telling local media he was "very excited" to bring internet services to areas with limited or no connectivity and that internet connectivity can be "a life-saver to remote medical clinics."
"It is really important to emphasize the importance of internet connectivity and how much of a life-changer and a life-saver it can be," Musk told local media on Sunday.
SpaceX, which manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft, is also a developer of Starlink satellites which provide internet connectivity to remote locations. Starlink is already available in Southeast Asia in Malaysia and the Philippines.
Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago with more than 17,000 islands, faces an urban-rural connectivity divide where millions of people living in rural areas have limited or no access to internet services.
Communication and Informatics Minister Budi Arie Setiadi previously said Starlink would help Indonesia extend internet access to regions not covered by local internet providers, according to Indonesian news agency Antara.

Hims & Hers weight loss adds compounded GLP-1 injections
description3:
Digital pharmacy startup Hims & Hers Health is introducing access to compounded GLP-1 weight loss injections, the company announced Monday.
Shares of the company closed up more than 27% Monday.
The company, which offers a range of direct-to-consumer treatments for conditions like erectile dysfunction and hair loss, launched a weight loss program in December. But GLP-1 medications — such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which have skyrocketed in popularity — were not previously offered as part of that program.
Customers can access the compounded GLP-1 medications via a prescription from a licensed health-care provider on the Hims & Hers platform. Hims & Hers said it plans to make branded GLP-1 medications available to its customers once supply is consistently available.
The company's oral medication kits start at $79 a month, and its compounded GLP-1 injections will start at $199 a month.
Even before it added compounded GLP-1s to its portfolio, Hims & Hers said in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it expects its weight loss program to bring in more than $100 million in revenue by the end of 2025. The company plans to offer updated guidance in its next earnings report.
The GLP-1 market, dominated so far by pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk , has faced supply constraints in recent months as the drugs get expanded approval from health regulators and increased health coverage.
GLP-1s mimic a hormone produced in the gut to tamp down a person's appetite and regulate their blood sugar. When those medications are in shortage, certain manufacturers can prepare a compounded version if they meet U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements.
The FDA does not review the safety and efficacy of compounded products, which are custom-made alternatives to brand drugs designed to meet a specific patient's needs.
In a January release, the FDA said patients should not use a compounded GLP-1 drug if an approved drug, such as Wegovy, is available.
Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum told CNBC that the company is "confident" that customers will be able to access a consistent supply of the compounded medications.
Dudum said Hims & Hers has spent the last year learning about the GLP-1 supply chain and has partnered with one of the largest generic manufacturers in the country that has FDA oversight.
"We have a certain degree of exclusivity with that facility that will guarantee our consumers consistent volume and supply," he said.

New York AG announces $2 billion settlement with crypto lender Genesis
description4:
New York Attorney General Letitia James is settling with crypto lender Genesis for $2 billion to repay defrauded investors.
The company, once a business at the heart of Digital Currency Group, was among the multiple casualties in the industry contagion set off by the collapse of FTX. The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2023.
"This historic settlement is a major step toward ensuring the victims who invested in Genesis have a semblance of justice," said James of the deal, which is the largest against a crypto firm in the state's history.
"Once again, we see the real-world consequences and detrimental losses that can happen because of a lack of oversight and regulation within the cryptocurrency industry," James added.
In October, James sued DCG, its Genesis subsidiary, and Gemini Trust, claiming that the two misled investors about the Gemini Earn program, leading to more than $1 billion in losses. The lawsuit was broadened in February, alleging that DCG and Genesis defrauded additional investors out of more than $2 billion.
Despite a legal challenge brought by parent company DCG, a bankruptcy court approved the lender's Chapter 11 repayment plan, which included the settlement between James' office and Genesis.
Genesis neither admits nor denies allegations detailed in the lawsuit, and the arrangement notably excludes Gemini.
The settlement bars Genesis from operating in New York. The settlement also established a fund for victims comprising at least 29,000 New York residents who collectively gave more than $1.1 billion to Genesis through its Gemini Earn product.
The Securities and Exchange Commission also filed suit against Genesis and its one-time partner, Gemini, over the unregistered offering and sale of securities. The bankruptcy court has also approved a separate settlement that ends this complaint.
The restructuring plan includes a repayment plan for customers who have had tokens frozen on the platform since withdrawals were halted in November 2022.
This fund will receive assets remaining in Genesis's estate after initial bankruptcy distributions to creditors are made. According to the state attorney's office, if those creditors are not made whole based on present digital asset values, the fund will receive up to $2 billion from Genesis' remaining assets."
