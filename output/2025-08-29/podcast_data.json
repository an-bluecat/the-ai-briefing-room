Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

WhatsApp brought the legal case against NSO, citing a breach of federal and state hacking laws, as well as its own terms of service.\nEarlier this year, WhatsApp disrupted a spyware campaign that targeted around 90 users, including journalists and members of civil society across Italy. The Italian government denied its involvement in the spying campaign. Paragon, whose spyware was used in the campaign, later cut off Italy from its hacking tools for failing to investigate the abuse.\nDid you receive a notification that your device was compromised?

Meta says these are interim changes, and the company will release more robust, long-lasting safety updates for minors in the future.\nMeta spokesperson Stephanie Otway acknowledged that the company\u2019s chatbots could previously talk with teens about all of these topics in ways the company had deemed appropriate. Meta now recognizes this was a mistake.\n\u201cAs our community grows and technology evolves, we\u2019re continually learning about how young people may interact with these tools and strengthening our protections accordingly,\u201d said Otway. \u201cAs we continue to refine our systems, we\u2019re adding more guardrails as an extra precaution \u2014 including training our AIs not to engage with teens on these topics, but to guide them to expert resources, and limiting teen access to a select group of AI characters for now. These updates are already in progress, and we will continue to adapt our approach to help ensure teens have safe, age-appropriate experiences with AI.\u201d\nBeyond the training updates, the company will also limit teen access to certain AI characters that could hold inappropriate conversations. Some of the user-made AI characters that Meta makes available on Instagram and Facebook include sexualized chatbots such as \u201cStep Mom\u201d and \u201cRussian Girl.\u201d Instead, teen users will only have access to AI characters that promote education and creativity, Otway said.\nThe policy changes are being announced just a two weeks after a Reuters investigation unearthed an internal Meta policy document that appeared to permit the company\u2019s chatbots to engage in sexual conversations with underage users. \u201cYour youthful form is a work of art,\u201d read one passage listed as an acceptable response. \u201cEvery inch of you is a masterpiece \u2013 a treasure I cherish deeply.\u201d Other examples showed how the AI tools should respond to requests for violent imagery or sexual imagery of public figures.\nMeta says the document was inconsistent with its broader policies, and has since been changed \u2013 but the report has sparked sustained controversy over potential child safety risks. Shortly after the report released, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) launched an official probe into the company\u2019s AI policies. Additionally, a coalition of 44 state attorneys general wrote to a group of AI companies including Meta, emphasizing the importance of child safety and specifically citing the Reuters report. \u201cWe are uniformly revolted by this apparent disregard for children\u2019s emotional well-being,\u201d the letter reads, \u201cand alarmed that AI Assistants are engaging in conduct that appears to be prohibited by our respective criminal laws.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOtway declined to comment on how many of Meta\u2019s AI chatbot users are minors, and wouldn\u2019t say whether the company expects its AI user base to decline as a result of these decisions.\nUpdate 10:35AM PT: This story was updated to note that these are interim changes, and that Meta plans to update its AI safety policies further in the future.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla challenges $243 million verdict in Autopilot death trial\ndescription2:\nTesla has asked a judge to nix the $243 million verdict lodged against the company in a lawsuit involving its Autopilot system, or to allow a new trial to occur, according to a new court filing.\nThe company\u2019s lawyers argue that the verdict, which a jury made earlier this month, \u201cflies in the face of basic Florida tort law, the Due Process Clause, and common sense.\u201d This latest filing by Tesla lawyers tries, once again, to rest all of the blame on the driver George McGee, who helped cause the crash.\nThe jury in the case ultimately decided that the driver deserved two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla.\nThe high-profile case centered around a 2019 crash in Florida. McGee was driving a Tesla Model S at night and using the company\u2019s Autopilot driver assistance system \u2014 which is a less capable system than the more fully featured \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d software. Both systems require the driver to keep their hands on the wheel.\nAs he approached a perpendicularly parked SUV, neither McGee nor the Autopilot system applied the brakes. McGee\u2019s car blew a stop sign and hit the SUV, killing 20-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injuring her boyfriend Dillon Angulo.\nMcGee was sued separately and settled with the victims. This week, we learned that Tesla rejected a settlement offer of $60 million from the victims a few months before the verdict was rendered.\nTesla\u2019s lawyers argue in the new filing that product liability law is supposed to penalize manufacturers whose cars \u201cperform in ways that dangerously defy ordinary consumers\u2019 expectations or are unreasonably dangerous.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cThat is not this case \u2014 not in the slightest,\u201d they wrote. They say McGee\u2019s \u201cextraordinary recklessness\u201d was to blame, as he was reaching for his phone when the crash occurred \u2014 a fact he admitted to in his own case.\nAllowing the verdict to stand, they argue, would \u201cdeter innovation, confound consumer expectations, and lead manufacturers to abandon safety enhancements for fear of being subjected to large punishments when a driver misuses their product.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s lawyers also take shots at the opposing lawyers in the filing, claiming they \u201coverwhelmed this jury with a flood of highly prejudicial but irrelevant evidence \u2014 about data preservation, Elon Musk, and dissimilar accidents.\u201d\n\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel ensured that this trial was never actually about the 2019 Tesla Model S or the accident caused by McGee\u2019s reckless driving,\u201d they wrote.\nBrett Schreiber, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said in an email \u201cthe motion is the latest example of Tesla and Musk\u2019s complete disregard for the human cost of their defective technology.\u201d\n\u201cThe jury heard all the facts and came to the right conclusion that this was a case of shared responsibility, but that does not discount the integral role Autopilot and the company\u2019s misrepresentations of its capabilities played in the crash that killed Naibel and permanently injured Dillon,\u201d Schreiber continued in the email. \u201cWe are confident the court will uphold this verdict, which serves not as an indictment of the autonomous vehicle industry, but of Tesla\u2019s reckless and unsafe development and deployment of its Autopilot system.\u201d\nArticle updated to include a statement from Brett Schreiber, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs.\n\ntitle3:\nUber and Lyft drivers in California win a path to unionization\ndescription3:\nCalifornia lawmakers struck a deal with Uber and Lyft that will allow app-based drivers to form unions and could make ride-hail fares more affordable.\nThe agreement is a win for gig workers who have long been classified as independent contractors, and thus, ineligible for certain protections that employees receive, like the right to collective bargaining.\nGov. Gavin Newsom, alongside Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, announced Friday support for two pieces of legislation that form a pathway for app-based drivers to unionize. Assembly Bill 1340 is sponsored by SEIU California, and Senate Bill 371 is sponsored by Uber and Lyft.\nNewsom called it an \u201chistoric agreement between workers and business that only California could deliver.\u201d He said labor representatives and the companies \u201cfound common ground that will empower hundreds of thousands of drivers while making rideshare more affordable for millions of Californians.\u201d\nThe agreement creates a model for drivers to be able to organize for increased pay, job protections, and other benefits.\nIn exchange, California regulators say they\u2019ll support legislation to reduce expensive insurance coverage mandates that ride-hailing companies have to pay. Uber and Lyft have attributed those insurance payments to higher ride fares in California and lower driver pay.\n\u201cWith Sacramento now aligned on the need to make rideshare more affordable in California, we\u2019re happy to see these two important pieces of legislation moving forward together,\u201d Ramona Prieto, Uber\u2019s head of public policy for California, said in a statement.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe deal comes years after Uber, Lyft, and other app-based gig companies spent more than $200 million to convince California voters to pass Prop 22, which classifies gig workers as independent contractors while granting them limited benefits.\nDrivers have long criticized the system for giving companies broad control over pay and deactivations, leaving them limited power to influence earnings or working conditions. Supporters of the new agreement say it could give drivers a stronger voice in pushing back against unfair treatment.\n\u201cLike many immigrants, driving for gig companies has been my main source of income,\u201d said Margarita Pe\u00f1alosa, a gig driver from Los Angeles and member of California Gig Workers Union. \u201cSome drivers fear getting deactivated and losing their jobs, so we often feel pressured to stay silent instead of demanding fair treatment. No one should have to risk their livelihoods just for asking to be treated fairly. AB 1340 would give gig drivers a real voice and the protections we need to be treated with respect and dignity.\u201d\nThe deal could have ripple effects across other states. In 2024, Massachusetts voters approved a similar initiative to allow ride-hail drivers to form unions and negotiate pay, benefits, and working conditions.\nThis article was updated with a statement from Uber and an Uber driver.\n\ntitle4:\nCracks are forming in Meta\u2019s partnership with Scale AI\ndescription4:\nIt\u2019s only been since June that Meta invested $14.3 billion in the data-labeling vendor Scale AI, bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang and several of the startup\u2019s top executives to run Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). But the relationship between the two companies is already showing signs of fraying.\nAt least one of the executives Wang brought over to help run MSL \u2014 Scale AI\u2019s former Senior Vice President of GenAI Product and Operations, Ruben Mayer \u2014 has departed Meta after just two months with the company, two people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.\nMayer spent roughly five years with Scale AI across two stints. In his short time at Meta, according to those sources, Mayer oversaw AI data operations teams but wasn\u2019t part of the company\u2019s TBD Labs \u2014 the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence, where top AI researchers from OpenAI have landed.\nHowever, Mayer disputes some details about his role, telling TechCrunch that his initial position was \u201cto help set up the lab, with whatever was needed\u201d rather than data, and that he was \u201cpart of TBD Labs from day one\u201d rather than being excluded from the core AI unit. Mayer also clarified that he \u201cdid not report directly to [Wang]\u201d and was \u201cvery happy\u201d with his Meta experience.\nBeyond the personnel changes, Meta\u2019s relationship with Scale AI appears to be shifting. TBD Labs is working with third-party data labeling vendors other than Scale AI to train its upcoming AI models, according to five people familiar with the matter. Those third-party vendors include Mercor and Surge, two of Scale AI\u2019s largest competitors, the people said.\nWhile AI labs commonly work with several data labeling vendors \u2013 Meta has been working with Mercor and Surge since before TBD Labs was spun up \u2013 it\u2019s rare for an AI lab to invest so heavily in one data vendor. That makes this situation especially notable: even with Meta\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investment, several sources said that researchers in TBD Labs see Scale AI\u2019s data as low quality and have expressed a preference to work with Surge and Mercor.\nScale AI initially built its business on a crowdsourcing model that used a large, low-cost workforce to handle simple data labeling, which is the process of tagging and annotating raw information to train AI models. But as AI models have grown more sophisticated, they now require highly-skilled domain experts\u2014such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists\u2014to generate and refine the high-quality data needed to improve their performance.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAlthough Scale AI has moved to attract these subject matter experts with its Outlier platform, competitors like Surge and Mercor have been growing quickly because their business models were built on a foundation of high-paid talent from the outset.\nA Meta spokesperson disputed the fact that there are quality issues with Scale AI\u2019s product. Surge and Mercor declined to comment. Asked about Meta\u2019s deepening reliance on competing data providers, a Scale AI spokesperson directed TechCrunch to its initial announcement of Meta\u2019s investment in the startup, which cites an expansion of the companies\u2019 commercial relationship.\nMeta\u2019s deals with third-party data vendors likely mean the company is not putting all its eggs in Scale AI, even after investing billions in the startup. The same can\u2019t be said for Scale AI, however. Not long after Meta announced its massive investment with Scale AI, OpenAI and Google said they would stop working with the data provider.\nShortly after losing those customers, Scale AI laid off 200 employees in its data labeling business in July, with the company\u2019s new CEO, Jason Droege, blaming the changes in part on \u201cshifts in market demand.\u201d Droege said Scale AI would staff up in other parts of the business, including government sales \u2014 the company just landed a $99 million contract with the U.S. Army.\nSome speculated initially that Meta\u2019s investment in Scale AI was really to lure Wang, a founder who has operated in the AI space since Scale AI was founded in 2016 and who appears to be helping Meta to attract top AI talent.\nAside from Wang, there\u2019s an open question around how valuable Scale is to Meta.\nOne current MSL employee says that several of the Scale executives brought over to Meta are not working on the core TBD Labs team.\nMeanwhile, Meta\u2019s AI unit has become increasingly chaotic since bringing on Wang and a wave of top researchers, according to two former employees and one current MSL employee. New talent from OpenAI and Scale AI have expressed frustration with navigating the bureaucracy of a big company, while Meta\u2019s previous GenAI team has seen its scope limited, they said.\nThe tensions indicate that Meta\u2019s largest AI investment to date may be off to a rocky start, despite that it was supposed to address the company\u2019s AI development challenges. After the lackluster launch of Llama 4 in April, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew frustrated with the company\u2019s AI team, one current and one former employee told TechCrunch.\nIn an effort to turn things around and catch up with OpenAI and Google, Zuckerberg rushed to strike deals and launched an aggressive campaign to recruit top AI talent.\nBeyond Wang, Zuckerberg has managed to pull in top AI researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. Meta has also acquired AI voice startups including Play AI and WaveForms AI, and announced a partnership with the AI image generation startup, Midjourney.\nTo power its AI ambitions, Meta recently announced several massive data center buildouts across the U.S. One of the largest is a $50 billion data center in Louisiana called Hyperion, named after a titan in Greek mythology that fathered the God of Sun.\nWang, who\u2019s not an AI researcher by background, was viewed as a somewhat unconventional choice to lead an AI lab. Zuckerberg reportedly held talks to bring in more traditional candidates to lead the effort, such as OpenAI\u2019s chief research officer, Mark Chen, and tried to acquire the startups of Ilya Sutskever and Mira Murati. All of them declined.\nSome of the new AI researchers recently brought in from OpenAI have already left Meta, Wired previously reported. Meanwhile, many longtime members of Meta\u2019s GenAI unit have departed in light of the changes.\nMSL AI researcher Rishabh Agarwal is among the latest, posting on X this week that he\u2019d be leaving the company.\n\u201cThe pitch from Mark and @alexandr_wang to build in the Superintelligence team was incredibly compelling,\u201d said Agarwal. \u201cBut I ultimately choose to follow Mark\u2019s own advice: \u2018In a world that\u2019s changing so fast, the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk\u2019.\u201d\nAsked afterward about his time at Meta and what drove his decision to leave, Agarwal declined to comment.\nDirector of product management for generative AI, Chaya Nayak, and research engineer, Rohan Varma, have also announced their departure from Meta in recent weeks. The question now is whether Meta can stabilize its AI operations and retain the talent it needs for its future success.\nMSL has already started working on its next generation AI model.
