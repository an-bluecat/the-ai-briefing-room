Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday September 11), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI and Oracle reportedly ink historic cloud computing deal\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nOracle sent its shares soaring after markets closed yesterday after reporting that it signed multiple multi-billion-dollar contracts with several customers. Now, we have an idea of who those customers might be.\nOracle signed a deal with OpenAI for the AI company to purchase $300 billion worth of compute power over a span of about five years, according to reporting from the Wall Street Journal. OpenAI would start purchasing this compute in 2027.\nIf the WSJ\u2019s reporting is correct, this would be one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. Oracle declined to comment. OpenAI did not respond to a request for confirmation or comment.\nOracle is no stranger to working with OpenAI. OpenAI started tapping Oracle for compute in the summer of 2024. The AI giant also moved further away from exclusively using Microsoft Azure as its only cloud provider in January.\nThis move away from Microsoft was timed with OpenAI\u2019s involvement with the Stargate Project, in which OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle have committed to invest $500 billion into domestic data center projects over the next four years.\nOpenAI clearly needs as much compute as it can get. The company reportedly signed a cloud deal with Google, according to Reuters, this spring despite the fact that the two companies are racing against each other for AI supremacy.\n\ntitle1:\nPerplexity reportedly raised $200M at $20B valuation\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nPerplexity, the AI-powered search startup that compete with Google by providing conversational answers to user queries, has secured $200 million in new capital at a $20 billion valuation, The Information reported. The fresh funding comes just two months after the company raised $100 million at an $18 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg\u2019s July report.\nSince its founding three years ago, the rapidly growing AI company has raised $1.5 billion in total funding, according to PitchBook data. It\u2019s unclear who led Perplexity\u2019s latest capital injection. Bloomberg reported that the July financing was an extension of a previous $500 million round completed earlier this year at a $14 billion valuation, which came just months earlier, a deal that was led by Accel.\nAccording to a source familiar with the company, Perplexity\u2019s annual recurring revenue (ARR) is approaching $200 million. Last month, Perplexity\u2019s head of communication told Business Insider that the company\u2019s ARR was more than $150 million.\nPerplexity didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe funding comes as Perplexity positions itself as a challenger to Google\u2019s search dominance. In August, Perplexity offered to buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. The offer came after the Justice Department, alleging that Google was acting anticompetitively, proposed that the company sell its web browser. However, earlier this month, a federal judge ruled that Google will not have to break up its search business, effectively allowing the search giant to keep Chrome.\n\ntitle2:\nReplit hits $3B valuation on $150M annualized revenue\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nReplit has raised a $250 million round, valuing the company at $3 billion. Unlike other fast-growing vibe coders, Replit has not been running to VCs every few months, though we\u2019ll see if that changes. Its last raise was in 2023 when it raised about $100 million that valued the company at $1.16 billion post-money. Replit has now raised a total of about $478 million, PitchBook estimates.\nThe company, founded in 2016 by programmers Amjad Masad (pictured), Faris Masad, and designer Haya Odeh, says it\u2019s been growing rapidly as of late. Annualized revenue has skyrocketed from $2.8 million to $150 million in less than a year, it said. That compares to $100 million ARR in June, Masad tweeted at the time.\nPrysm Capital led the round, with participation from Amex Ventures and Google\u2019s AI Futures Fund. Previous investors Y Combinator, David Sacks\u2019 Craft, Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Paul Graham, and others also pitched in.\nGoogle\u2019s involvement isn\u2019t surprising. Replit has been a close partner with Google Cloud; the vibe-coded apps built with it are often hosted on Google. However, Replit has become such a popular tool of late that Microsoft started offering Replit as an option on Azure in July.\n\ntitle3:\nKlarna's IPO pops, raising $1.4B, with Sequoia as the biggest winner\ndescription3:\nIt\u2019s been a long road for the 20-year-old fintech Klarna to make it to an IPO. But on Wednesday, the company successfully landed on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $1.4 billion, largely for its existing investors, rather than itself.\nThe fintech giant sold shares at $40, above its announced range of $35 to $37, and came out of the gate with a $15 billion valuation. Shares popped, opening at $52, though quickly settling down to around $46 mid-day.\nOf the 34.3 million shares Klarna sold, only 5 million were sold by the company, it said. The rest were sold by existing investors like the company\u2019s largest shareholder Sequoia Capital. Entities controlled by Dutch billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, Silver Lake, BlackRock, and many others sold as well. Despite cashing out some shares, all of them are holding onto the majority of their stakes.\nFigma\u2019s IPO did a similar thing. Yet, often these existing investors don\u2019t want to sell at the IPO price, a VC told TechCrunch. They kick in shares to help the company meet IPO demand. Floating more shares helps the company obtain a more accurate, and perhaps higher, valuation out of the gate because it helps the IPO attract the biggest institutional investors who wouldn\u2019t bother with an IPO for a small allocation.\nIn Klarna\u2019s case co-founder CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did not sell any shares. His stake was worth $1.02 billion at the IPO selling price of $40 and he controls about 7.5% of the company.\nVictor Jacobsson, the co-founder who left the company in 2012, did sell but was, and still is, a slightly larger shareholder. He cashed out of 1.1 million shares and still retains over 8% of the company.\nCo-founder Niklas Adalberth still owns just under 3 million shares, Klarna disclosed.\nSequoia is by far the biggest investor in Klarna, controlling nearly 23% of the company. Famed VC Michael Moritz wrote Klarna\u2019s first check on Sequoia\u2019s behalf in 2010, and stayed on as Klarna\u2019s chairperson even after he left Sequoia in 2023. Some drama ensued when Sequoia added another member to Klarna\u2019s board. But it eventually sorted itself out when Sequoia\u2019s Andrew Reed joined its board in 2024.\n\u201cThis moment feels surreal,\u201d Siemiatkowski shared in published remarks. \u201cWhen we started Klarna back in 2005, it was just a wild idea \u2014 me, Niklas, and Victor, fumbling around, trying to make shopping and payments smoother for people. We got rejected left and right, laughed at more times than I can count. But we kept going.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cGoing public in New York is huge. It\u2019s not just a milestone; it\u2019s a statement. It\u2019s proof that a bunch of stubborn dreamers from Stockholm can take on the world \u2014 and win.\u201d\nInterestingly, though, $1.4 billion is not the record for the biggest IPO of 2025. That\u2019s still held by CoreWeave, which raised $1.5 billion in June.\n\ntitle4:\nJaguar Land Rover says data stolen in disruptive cyberattack\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nJaguar Land Rover said on Wednesday that an unspecified amount of data was stolen during a cyberattack that has brought vehicle assembly lines to a standstill.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the U.K.-based maker of Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles said it was aware that \u201csome data\u201d was taken in the incident.\nCompanies that operate in the U.K. are obligated to notify the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office within three days of discovering a data breach. It\u2019s not immediately clear if the data relates to the company, its employees, or its customers.\nJaguar Land Rover disclosed the cyberattack on September 2, saying the incident forced the company to shut down its systems, which \u201cseverely disrupted\u201d its production line and sales operations. The incident is also affecting the company\u2019s supply chains, including vehicle repairs.\nThe carmaker is one of the largest employers in the U.K., with more than 33,000 staff. Per one newspaper report, U.K. government officials are said to be concerned about the economic fallout of the breach, and a recovery is expected to take weeks, not days.\"\n\nResponse:",
