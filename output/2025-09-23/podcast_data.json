The new data centers will bring Stargate\u2019s planned capacity to seven gigawatts \u2014 enough energy to power more than five million homes.\nThree of the new sites are being developed with Oracle. They\u2019re located in Shackelford County, Texas; Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico; and an undisclosed location in the Midwest. The other two sites are being developed with SoftBank, with one in Lordstown, Ohio and the other in Milam County, Texas.\nThe new Stargate AI data centers are part of OpenAI\u2019s massive infrastructure buildout, as the company works to train and serve more powerful AI models. On Monday, OpenAI said it would receive a $100 billion investment from Nvidia to buy the chipmaker\u2019s AI processors and build out even more AI data centers.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle's AI Mode arrives in Spanish globally\ndescription1:\nGoogle Search is bringing its AI Mode feature \u2014 its AI-powered search experience \u2014 to Spanish-speaking users, the company announced on Tuesday. This expansion will introduce Google\u2019s conversational search interface to a broader market, allowing users to ask questions using natural language queries, engage in back-and-forth conversations, upload images, dig deeper on complex topics, and more.\nThe Spanish-language rollout comes on the heels of Google\u2019s major AI Mode expansion in August, when the company released the feature to 180 more countries worldwide. Previously, it had only been available in the U.S., U.K., and India. During that August rollout, Google also introduced advanced AI capabilities to its Google AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to request restaurant reservations in AI Mode. The company plans to introduce support for other types of appointments and event ticket purchases in the future.\nGoogle has been rapidly rolling out AI across its products and services, often with multiple product announcements occurring simultaneously. For instance, the company announced Tuesday that it was bringing conversational photo editing to all Android users in the U.S. It also announced the same day that its more affordable Google AI Plus subscription plan, first introduced in Indonesia, is now arriving in 40 more countries. This expansion follows OpenAI\u2019s recent launch of its ChatGPT\u2019s Go plan, which launched in India in August and in Indonesia on Tuesday.\nThe ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI\u2019s free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. According to OpenAI, the plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time.\nGoogle announced earlier this month that AI Mode also now supports Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.\nWith so many products, users may find it hard to distinguish between different features and functionality, like the difference between Google\u2019s AI Mode and its AI Overviews. The former is a separate, immersive, and conversational experience where users chat directly with Gemini AI. Meanwhile, AI Overviews simply offer a quick, AI-generated summary of information about your search query at the top of Google\u2019s Search results.\n\ntitle2:\nHow Google\u2019s dev tools manager makes AI coding work\ndescription2:\nAs Google\u2019s project manager for developer tools, Ryan Salva has a front-row seat to the ways AI tools are changing coding. Formerly of GitHub and Microsoft, he\u2019s now responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist, nudging developers into the new world of agentic programming.\nHis team released new third-party research on Tuesday showing how developers actually use AI tools \u2014 and how much progress is left to make. I sat down with Salva to talk about the report and his personal experience with AI coding tools.\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity.\nEvery year, Google does a survey of developer trends \u2014 but this year\u2019s report really focuses on AI tools, and specifically how agentic developers are willing to get in their approach to programming. Was there anything in the research that surprised you?\nOne of the really interesting findings was the median date when developers started using AI tools. They found it was April 2024, which corresponds fairly neatly to Claude 3 coming out and Gemini 2.5 coming out. This is really the dawn of the reasoning or thinking models, and around that same time, we got much better at tool-calling.\nFor coding tasks, you really need to be able to leverage external information in order to problem solve, so it may need to grep, it may need to compile the code. If the code compiles it may want to run that unit test, and that integration test. I think that tool-calling really is the important piece that gave models the ability to self-correct as they move along.\nHow are you using AI coding tools personally?\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nMost of my coding these days is for hobby projects, and I spend most of my time using command line-based tools. So that includes Gemini CLI. Then there\u2019s a little bit of Claude Code, little bit of Codex in there. And you don\u2019t ever really use a terminal-based tool by itself, so I\u2019m really heterogeneous around the IDEs that I use. I use Zed. I use VS code. I use Cursor. I use Windsurf, all of them, because I\u2019m interested in just seeing how the world works and how the industry is evolving.\nOn the professional side, product managers tend to live in documents, so the first thing is using AI to help me write the specification and requirements docs.\nI\u2019m curious how that works. You\u2019re using Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI, but I would imagine it doesn\u2019t just run itself.\nA development task will usually start as an issue, maybe it\u2019s a GitHub issue that someone\u2019s dropped with a bug. Often, if I\u2019m really being honest, it\u2019s a fairly under-specified issue. So I\u2019ll use Gemini CLI in order to create a more robust requirement doc in Markdown. That will usually create probably about 100 lines of fairly technical, but also outcome-driven specification. Then I will use Gemini CLI to write the code based on that specification and the general preferences in the team documents.\nAcross the engineering team, we have a couple of different layers of rules and Markdown docs that get consumed by the model, just laying out our way of working: Here\u2019s how we do testing, here\u2019s how we manage dependencies, and so on. So when it produces the code, it\u2019s also working from those documents.\nAnd as Gemini CLI is going through and doing the troubleshooting, I\u2019ll have it update my requirements doc saying, \u201cI fixed this step. Now I\u2019m on to the next step,\u201d and so on. Each one of those creates its own commit and pull request in the repository, so I can always rewind or undo.\nI would say probably 70% to 80% of my work is me working in the terminal with natural language, trying to use Gemini CLI to craft the requirements, and then allowing Gemini CLI to write most of the code for me, which I will then go review and read with whatever IDE I happen to be using. But mostly I\u2019m using the IDE as a place to read the code, rather than to write the code.\nDo you think there\u2019s a future for raw computer code? Or will we just move everything into terminal windows?\nFor three decades, the IDE was where we went to do everything in software development. You had the IDE, you had the browser, and you had the terminal window.\nI think that\u2019s still largely the case, but I suspect that over time we\u2019ll end up spending a lot more time working with the requirements, and the amount of time spent in the IDE will gradually shrink. And I think that change may actually happen over a pretty long time horizon.\nThere\u2019s a lot of angst about what that means for software development as a progression. If 10 years from now, we\u2019re no longer looking at code, what does that mean for developers? Will there still be a job for them?\nI think that your job as a developer is going to look a lot more like an architect. It is going to be about taking big, complex problems and breaking them down into smaller, solvable tasks. You\u2019ll need to be thinking about like the bigger picture about what you\u2019re trying to produce, rather than the intermediate language in order to express that in machine code.\n\ntitle3:\nDisney is raising the price of Disney+, Hulu subscriptions next month\ndescription3:\nDisney is raising the price of Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions once again. Starting October 21, many of the streaming services\u2019 standalone plans and bundles will see price increases.\nThe Disney+ standalone plan with ads will increase by $2 to $11.99 per month, while the no-ads Disney+ Premium plan is increasing by $3 to $18.99 per month. The Disney+ Premium annual plan is increasing by $30 to $189.99 per year.\nThe Hulu standalone plan with ads is increasing from $9.99 per month to $11.99. However, the premium version of Hulu with no ads will remain at $18.99 per month. Additionally, the price of ESPN Select is increasing from $11.99 to $12.99 per month.\nThe Disney+ and Hulu with ads bundle subscription price is going up by $2 to $12.99, while the Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN Select bundle with ads is increasing by $3 to $19.99. The full list of price increases for Disney+ and Hulu bundle plans can be found on the company\u2019s support page.\nThe timing of the price increases isn\u2019t ideal, as Disney+ subscribers canceled their subscriptions in droves last week, protesting Disney\u2019s decision to temporarily pull Jimmy Kimmel from its airwaves.\nDisney+ launched in 2019 with a $6.99 monthly subscription, and has since followed other streaming services in gradually increasing its prices. The company\u2019s last price hike was announced in October 2024, when the ad-free plan increased from $13.99 per month to $15.99, and the plan with ads increased from $7.99 per month to $9.99.\n\ntitle4:\nScott Wiener on his fight to make Big Tech disclose AI's dangers\ndescription4:\nThis is not California state senator Scott Wiener\u2019s first attempt at addressing the dangers of AI.\nIn 2024, Silicon Valley mounted a fierce campaign against his controversial AI safety bill, SB 1047, which would have made tech companies liable for the potential harms of their AI systems. Tech leaders warned that it would stifle America\u2019s AI boom. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill, echoing similar concerns, and a popular AI hacker house promptly threw an \u201cSB 1047 Veto Party.\u201d One attendee told me, \u201cThank god, AI is still legal.\u201d\nNow Wiener has returned with a new AI safety bill, SB 53, which sits on Governor Newsom\u2019s desk awaiting his signature or veto sometime in the next few weeks. This time around, the bill is much more popular or at least, Silicon Valley doesn\u2019t seem to be at war with it.\nAnthropic outright endorsed SB 53 earlier this month. Meta spokesperson Jim Cullinan tells TechCrunch that the company supports AI regulation that balances guardrails with innovation and says, \u201cSB 53 is a step in that direction,\u201d though there are areas for improvement.\nFormer White House AI policy adviser Dean Ball tells TechCrunch that SB 53 is a \u201cvictory for reasonable voices,\u201d and thinks there\u2019s a strong chance Governor Newsom signs it.\nIf signed, SB 53 would impose some of the nation\u2019s first safety reporting requirements on AI giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google \u2014 companies that today face no obligation to reveal how they test their AI systems. Many AI labs voluntarily publish safety reports explaining how their AI models could be used to create bioweapons and other dangers, but they do this at will and they\u2019re not always consistent.\nThe bill requires leading AI labs \u2014 specifically those making more than $500 million in revenue \u2014 to publish safety reports for their most capable AI models. Much like SB 1047, the bill specifically focuses on the worst kinds of AI risks: their ability to contribute to human deaths, cyberattacks, and chemical weapons. Governor Newsom is considering several other bills that address other types of AI risks, such as engagement-optimization techniques in AI companions.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nSB 53 also creates protected channels for employees working at AI labs to report safety concerns to government officials, and establishes a state-operated cloud computing cluster, CalCompute, to provide AI research resources beyond the Big Tech companies.\nOne reason SB 53 may be more popular than SB 1047 is that it\u2019s less severe. SB 1047 also would have made AI companies liable for any harms caused by their AI models, whereas SB 53 focuses more on requiring self-reporting and transparency. SB 53 also narrowly applies to the world\u2019s largest tech companies, rather than startups.\nBut many in the tech industry still believe states should leave AI regulation up to the federal government. In a recent letter to Governor Newsom, OpenAI argued that AI labs should only have to comply with federal standards \u2014 which is a funny thing to say to a state governor. Venture firm Andreessen Horowitz wrote a recent blog post vaguely suggesting that some bills in California could violate the Constitution\u2019s dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unfairly limiting interstate commerce.\nSenator Wiener addresses these concerns: He lacks faith in the federal government to pass meaningful AI safety regulation, so states need to step up. In fact, Wiener thinks the Trump administration has been captured by the tech industry and that recent federal efforts to block all state AI laws are a form of Trump \u201crewarding his funders.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has made a notable shift away from the Biden administration\u2019s focus on AI safety, replacing it with an emphasis on growth. Shortly after taking office, Vice President J.D. Vance appeared at an AI conference in Paris and said: \u201cI\u2019m not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago. I\u2019m here to talk about AI opportunity.\u201d\nSilicon Valley has applauded this shift, exemplified by Trump\u2019s AI Action Plan, which removed barriers to building out the infrastructure needed to train and serve AI models. Today, Big Tech CEOs are regularly seen dining at the White House or announcing hundred-billion-dollar data centers alongside President Trump.\nSenator Wiener thinks it\u2019s critical for California to lead the nation on AI safety, but without choking off innovation.\nI recently interviewed Senator Wiener to discuss his years at the negotiating table with Silicon Valley and why he\u2019s so focused on AI safety bills. Our conversation has been edited lightly for clarity and brevity.\nSenator Wiener, I interviewed you when SB 1047 was sitting on Governor Newsom\u2019s desk. Talk to me about the journey you\u2019ve been on to regulate AI safety in the last few years.\nIt\u2019s been a roller coaster, an incredible learning experience, and just really rewarding. We\u2019ve been able to help elevate this issue [of AI safety], not just in California, but in the national and international discourse.\nWe have this incredibly powerful new technology that is changing the world. How do we make sure it benefits humanity in a way where we reduce the risk? How do we promote innovation, while also being very mindful of public health and public safety. It\u2019s an important \u2014 and in some ways, existential \u2014 conversation about the future. SB 1047, and now SB 53, have helped to foster that conversation about safe innovation.\nIn the last 20 years of technology, what have you learned about the importance of laws that can hold Silicon Valley to account?\nI\u2019m the guy who represents San Francisco, the beating heart of AI innovation. I\u2019m immediately north of Silicon Valley itself, so we\u2019re right here in the middle of it all. But we\u2019ve also seen how the large tech companies \u2014 some of the wealthiest companies in world history \u2014 have been able to stop federal regulation.\nEvery time I see tech CEOs having dinner at the White House with the aspiring fascist dictator, I have to take a deep breath. These are all really brilliant people who have generated enormous wealth. A lot of folks I represent work for them. It really pains me when I see the deals that are being struck with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and how that money gets funneled into Trump\u2019s meme coin. It causes me deep concern.\nI\u2019m not someone who\u2019s anti-tech. I want tech innovation to happen. It\u2019s incredibly important. But this is an industry that we should not trust to regulate itself or make voluntary commitments. And that\u2019s not casting aspersions on anyone. This is capitalism, and it can create enormous prosperity but also cause harm if there are not sensible regulations to protect the public interest. When it comes to AI safety, we\u2019re trying to thread that needle.\nSB 53 is focused on the worst harms that AI could imaginably cause \u2014 death, massive cyberattacks, and the creation of bioweapons. Why focus there?\nThe risks of AI are varied. There is algorithmic discrimination, job loss, deep fakes, and scams. There have been various bills in California and elsewhere to address those risks. SB 53 was never intended to cover the field and address every risk created by AI. We\u2019re focused on one specific category of risk, in terms of catastrophic risk.\nThat issue came to me organically from folks in the AI space in San Francisco \u2014 startup founders, frontline AI technologists, and people who are building these models. They came to me and said, \u201cThis is an issue that needs to be addressed in a thoughtful way.\u201d\nDo you feel that AI systems are inherently unsafe, or have the potential to cause death and massive cyberattacks?\nI don\u2019t think they\u2019re inherently safe. I know there are a lot of people working in these labs who care very deeply about trying to mitigate risk. And again, it\u2019s not about eliminating risk. Life is about risk, unless you\u2019re going to live in your basement and never leave, you\u2019re going to have risk in your life. Even in your basement, the ceiling might fall down.\nIs there a risk that some AI models could be used to do significant harm to society? Yes, and we know there are people who would love to do that. We should try to make it harder for bad actors to cause these severe harms, and so should the people developing these models.\nAnthropic issued its support for SB 53. What are your conversations like with other industry players?\nWe\u2019ve talked to everyone: large companies, small startups, investors, and academics. Anthropic has been really constructive. Last year, they never formally supported [SB 1047] but they had positive things to say about aspects of the bill. I don\u2019t think [Anthropic] loves every aspect of SB 53, but I think they concluded that on balance the bill was worth supporting.\nI\u2019ve had conversations with large AI labs who are not supporting the bill, but are not at war with it in the way they were with SB 1047. It\u2019s not surprising. SB 1047 was more of a liability bill, SB 53 is more of a transparency bill. Startups have been less engaged this year because the bill really focuses on the largest companies.\nDo you feel pressure from the large AI PACs that have formed in recent months?\nThis is another symptom of Citizens United. The wealthiest companies in the world can just pour endless resources into these PACs to try to intimidate elected officials. Under the rules we have, they have every right to do that. It\u2019s never really impacted how I approach policy. There have been groups trying to destroy me for as long as I\u2019ve been in elected office. Various groups have spent millions trying to blow me up, and here I am. I\u2019m in this to do right by my constituents and try to make my community, San Francisco, and the world a better place.\nWhat\u2019s your message to Governor Newsom as he\u2019s debating whether to sign or veto this bill?\nMy message is that we heard you. You vetoed SB 1047 and provided a very comprehensive and thoughtful veto message. You wisely convened a working group that produced a very strong report, and we really looked to that report in crafting this bill. The governor laid out a path, and we followed that path in order to come to an agreement, and I hope we got there.\"\n\nResponse:",
