    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday August 4), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nA backlog at the Commerce Department is reportedly stalling Nvidia's H20 chip licenses\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nEarlier in July, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick gave chipmakers like Nvidia the green light to start selling certain AI chips in China again, but his department is said to be holding things up.\nAccording to reporting from Reuters, Nvidia has yet to receive a license to sell its H20 AI chips.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce is currently sitting on a backlog of licensing applications due to turmoil within the department, in large part because of a loss of staff and a breakdown in communications with the industry, per Reuters.\nThis holdup comes as national security experts are urging the Trump administration to restrict Nvidia from selling its H20 AI chips to China on national security grounds.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla partly liable in Florida Autopilot trial, jury awards $200M in damages\ndescription1:\nA jury in federal court in Miami has found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company\u2019s Autopilot driver assistance system.\nThe jury assessed punitive damages only against Tesla, CNBC reported. The punitive fines coupled with a compensatory damages puts the total payments to around $242.5 million.\nNeither the driver of the car nor the Autopilot system braked in time to avoid going through an intersection, where the car struck an SUV and killed a pedestrian. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame, and attributed one-third to Tesla. (The driver was sued separately.)\nThe verdict comes at the end of a three-week trial over the crash, which killed 20-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon and severely injured her boyfriend Dillon Angulo. The verdict is one of the first major legal decisions about driver assistance technology that has gone against Tesla. The company has previously settled lawsuits involving similar claims about Autopilot.\nBrett Schreiber, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement to TechCrunch that Tesla designed Autopilot \u201conly for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside Elon Musk telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans.\u201d\n\u201cTesla\u2019s lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm\u2019s way,\u201d said Schreiber. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict represents justice for Naibel\u2019s tragic death and Dillon\u2019s lifelong injuries, holding Tesla and Musk accountable for propping up the company\u2019s trillion-dollar valuation with self-driving hype at the expense of human lives.\u201d\nTesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch, said it plans to appeal the verdict \u201cgiven the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.\u201d\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla\u2019s and the entire industry\u2019s efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cTo be clear, no car in 2019, and none today, would have prevented this crash. This was never about Autopilot; it was a fiction concocted by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers blaming the car when the driver \u2014 from day one \u2014 admitted and accepted responsibility.\u201d\nTesla and Musk spent years making claims about Autopilot\u2019s capabilities that have led to overconfidence in the driver assistance system, a reality that government officials \u2014 and Musk himself \u2014 have spoken about for years.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) came to this determination in 2020 after investigating a 2018 crash where the driver died after hitting a concrete barrier. That driver, Walter Huang, was playing a mobile game while using Autopilot. The NTSB made a number of recommendations following that investigation, which Tesla largely ignored, the safety board later claimed.\nOn a 2018 conference call, Musk said \u201ccomplacency\u201d with driver assistance systems like Autopilot is a problem.\n\u201cThey just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It\u2019s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It\u2019s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do,\u201d Musk said at the time.\nThe trial took place at a time when Tesla is currently in the middle of rolling out the first versions of its long-promised Robotaxi network, starting in Austin, Texas. Those vehicles are using an enhanced version of Tesla\u2019s more capable driver assistance system, which it calls Full Self-Driving.\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include the amount of compensatory damages in the total.\n\ntitle2:\nVast Data in talks with Alphabet's CapitalG, Nvidia to fund round at up to $30B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nAI storage platform Vast Data is in talks with Alphabet\u2019s venture arm CapitalG and existing backer Nvidia to raise a fresh round that could value the startup at up to $30 billion, Reuters reported, citing two sources.\nTechCrunch reported last month that Vast Data was working to raise funds at a $25 billion valuation.\nThe round could close in the next few weeks, per Reuters, which would make New York-based Vast Data \u2014 last valued at $9.1 billion in 2023 \u2014 one of the most valuable tech companies.\nVast Data develops storage technology that claims to enable efficiency in AI data centers. As the AI boom intensifies and the U.S. government greenlights the scaled build-out of data centers, AI infrastructure startups are becoming a hot new focus for investment.\nThe startup has raised $380 million to date, and its CEO Renen Hallak said the company is free cash flow positive. Sources told Reuters that Vast Data earned $200 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by January 2025, with projections to grow to $600 million in ARR next year.\n\ntitle3:\nVenture firm CRV raises $750M, downsizing after returning capital to investors\ndescription3:\nCRV has secured $750 million toward the 55-year-old venture firm\u2019s twentieth flagship fund, it announced on Friday.\nThe new fund is smaller than the $1 billion early-stage fund CRV closed in the fall of 2022. At that time, the firm also announced a $500 million second Select fund, a capital pool for backing late-stage rounds of existing portfolio companies.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that CRV is not raising a late-stage fund as part of its new fundraise. Last year, the firm told The New York Times it was returning $275 million from its $500 million Select fund to investors. The firm explained that it would not be raising another late-stage vehicle because follow-on rounds for many of its companies would lower its overall returns.\nCRV\u2019s limited partners were eager to back the firm\u2019s smaller fund, the firm said. It raised its entire $750 million fund in just four weeks, with demand for double that amount, CRV wrote.\nThe latest fund will be used to invest in seed and Series A startups and it will focus on backing consumer and devtools companies.\nCRV is known for leading DoorDash\u2019s seed financing and the Series A rounds for both Mercury and Vercel, a cloud platform for web developers, which was last valued at $3.25 billion.\nSince its founding in 1970, CRV has backed over 750 startups, with 80 of them eventually going public.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
