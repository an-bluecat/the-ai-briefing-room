Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday May 1), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title1:\nAmazon launches Nova Premier, its most capable AI model yet\ndescription1:\nAmazon on Wednesday released what the company claims is the most capable AI model in its Nova family, Nova Premier.\nNova Premier, which can process text, images, and videos (but not audio), is available in Amazon Bedrock, the company\u2019s AI model development platform. Amazon says that Premier excels at \u201ccomplex tasks\u201d that \u201crequire deep understanding of context, multi-step planning, and precise execution across multiple tools and data sources.\u201d\nAmazon announced its Nova lineup of models in December at its annual AWS re:Invent conference. Over the last few months, the company has expanded the collection with image- and video-generating models as well as with audio understanding and agentic, task-performing releases.\nNova Premier, which has a context length of 1 million tokens, meaning it can analyze around 750,000 words in one go, is weaker on certain benchmarks than flagship models from rival AI companies such as Google. On SWE-Bench Verified, a coding test, Premier is behind Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and it also performs poorly on benchmarks measuring math and science knowledge, GPQA Diamond and AIME 2025.\nHowever, in bright spots for Premier, the model does well on tests for knowledge retrieval and visual understanding, SimpleQA and MMMU, according to Amazon\u2019s internal benchmarking.\nIn Bedrock, Premier is priced at $2.50 per 1 million tokens fed into the model and $12.50 per 1 million tokens generated by the model. That\u2019s around the same price as Gemini 2.5 Pro, which costs $2.50 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens.\nImportantly, Premier isn\u2019t a \u201creasoning\u201d model. As opposed to models like OpenAI\u2019s o4-mini and DeepSeek\u2019s R1, it can\u2019t take additional time and computing to carefully consider and fact-check its answers to questions.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nAmazon is pitching Premier as best for \u201cteaching\u201d smaller models via distillation \u2014 in other words, transferring its capabilities for a specific use case into a faster, more efficient package.\nAmazon sees AI as increasingly core to its overall growth strategy. CEO Andy Jassy recently said the company is building more than 1,000 generative AI applications and that Amazon\u2019s AI revenue is growing at \u201ctriple-digit\u201d year-over-year percentages and represents a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nEpic Games just scored a win against Apple\ndescription2:\nEpic Games notched a win in an ongoing legal dispute with Apple. The result could be Fortnite returning to the U.S. iOS app store as early as next week.\nJudge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in a ruling Wednesday that Apple was in \u201cwillful violation\u201d of a 2021 injunction that prohibited the company from anticompetitive pricing.\nApple won many of the arguments in the Epic Games trial. One notable exception was a ruling that prohibited Apple from collecting fees on purchases made outside of the apps themselves. At the time, Apple was told to change its app store to allow developers to direct customers to their websites where users could then make purchases.\nApple not only didn\u2019t comply, it did so \u201cwillfully\u201d and with the intent of creating new anticompetitive barriers.\n\u201cThat it thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As always, the coverup made it worse. For this Court, there is no second bite at the apple,\u201d Rogers said in the ruling. She went a step further and referred the case to the U.S. attorney to review it for possible criminal contempt proceedings.\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney took to X to announce it would bring the Fortnite game back to the U.S. App Store as soon as next week.\nAs The Verge reported, Sweeney also extended a proposal to Apple: \u201cIf Apple extends the court\u2019s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we\u2019ll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic,\u201d he wrote.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nThe ruling was celebrated by other tech companies affected by Apple\u2019s policy.\n\u201cThis landmark court ruling is a victory for developers everywhere,\u201d Spotify Spokesperson Jeanne Moran said in an emailed statement. \u201cSpotify will move quickly to submit an app update to Apple, enhancing the experience for our consumers across the United States.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nMeta forecasted it would make $1.4T in revenue from generative AI by 2035\ndescription3:\nMeta made a prediction last year its generative AI products would rake in $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue in 2025, and between $460 billion and $1.4 trillion by 2035, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.\nThe documents, submitted by attorneys for book authors suing Meta for what they claim is unauthorized training of the company\u2019s AI on their works, don\u2019t indicate what exactly Meta considers to be a \u201cgenerative AI product.\u201d But it\u2019s public knowledge that the tech giant makes money \u2014 and stands to make more money \u2014 from generative AI in a number of flavors.\nMeta has revenue-sharing agreements with certain companies that host its open Llama collection of models. The company recently launched an API for customizing and evaluating Llama models. And Meta AI, the company\u2019s AI assistant, may eventually show ads and offer a subscription option with additional features, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company\u2019s Q1 earnings call Wednesday.\nThe court documents also reveal Meta is spending an enormous amount on its AI product groups.\nIn 2024, the company\u2019s \u201cGenAI\u201d budget was over $900 million, and this year, it could exceed $1 billion, according to the documents. That\u2019s not including the infrastructure needed to run and train AI models. Meta previously said it plans to spend $60 billion to $80 billion on capital expenditures in 2025, primarily on expansive new data centers.\nThose budgets might have been higher had they included deals to license books from the authors suing Meta. For instance, Meta discussed in 2023 spending upwards of $200 million to acquire training data for Llama, around $100 million of which would have gone toward books alone, per the documents. But the company allegedly decided to pursue other options: pirating ebooks on a massive scale.\nA Meta spokesperson sent TechCrunch the following statement:\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Additionally, World has established separate collaborations with both the prediction market startup Kalshi and the decentralized lending platform Morpho; these partnerships enable customers to sign in to these services using their IDs already registered with World. And World plans to team up with Visa to launch The World Card, a card that lets users spend digital assets anywhere Visa is accepted.\nImage Credits:World\nSince its founding in 2019, World, developed by San Francisco- and Berlin-based Tools for Humanity, has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital and created digital IDs for millions of users. But it has yet to breach the mainstream, in part because of its cumbersome approach to verifying IDs.\nWith these new partnerships, World is going after a broader audience \u2014 one that previously might not have considered having their eyeballs scanned to verify their \u201chumanness.\u201d\nThe World Card is perhaps the most interesting of the new projects. Expected to become available in the U.S. later this year, it\u2019ll connect to World\u2019s World App and allow users to transact with cryptocurrencies. The card will automatically exchange crypto to fiat when needed, and potentially offer certain rewards for specific \u201cAI subscriptions and services.\u201d\nWorld had one surprise in store at its Wednesday event: a collaboration with Stripe to allow users to pay with World on Stripe-enabled websites and apps. The company didn\u2019t say when this might go live.\"\n\nResponse:",
