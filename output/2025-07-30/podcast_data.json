The company said Wednesday in its second-quarter earnings report that it plans to more than double its spend on building AI infrastructure, like data centers and servers.\n\u201cWe currently expect 2025 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $66-72 billion\u2026up approximately $30 billion year-over-year at the midpoint,\u201d Meta said.\nThat\u2019s an aggressive capex growth, and one that Meta plans to continue onwards to 2026. The company said it expects a similarly large increase in spend on AI infrastructure next year as the company continues to \u201caggressively [pursue] opportunities to bring additional capacity online to meet the needs of [its] artificial intelligence efforts and business operations.\u201d\n\u201cWe expect that developing leading AI infrastructure will be a core advantage in developing the best AI models and product experiences, so we expect to ramp our investments significantly in 2026 to support that work,\u201d said Susan Li, Meta CFO, during the company\u2019s Wednesday earnings call.\nLi also noted that while Meta expects to finance most of its AI spend on its own, the company is exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any finalized transactions to announce, but we generally believe that there will be models here that will attract significant external financing to support large-scale data center projects that are developed using our ability to build world-class infrastructure, while providing us with flexibility should our infrastructure requirements change over time,\u201d Li said.\nMeta has announced two major AI \u201ctitan clusters.\u201d The first is Prometheus in Ohio, which is poised to be among the first AI superclusters to hit 1 gigawatt of compute power when it comes online in 2026. Then there\u2019s Hyperion, a cluster in Louisiana that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bragged would have a footprint the size of Manhattan and could scale up to 5 gigawatts over several years. On top of those, Meta has several other unnamed titan-scale clusters underway.\nMeta\u2019s data center projects promise to soak up enough energy to power millions of homes, pulling that electricity from nearby communities. One of the company\u2019s projects in Newton County, Georgia, has already caused the water taps to run dry in some residents\u2019 homes.\nMeta also noted in its earnings report that it expects its second-largest driver of growth to be employee compensation as the company spends millions, and possibly even billions, to poach talented AI engineers and researchers to work for Meta\u2019s newly formed business unit, Superintelligence Labs.\nBefore earnings, Zuckerberg shared his vision for \u201cpersonal superintelligence,\u201d the idea that AI should help individual people live their best lives, mainly through the medium of Meta\u2019s smart glasses and virtual reality headsets.\nMeta\u2019s stock surged 10% in after-hours as investors responded to Meta\u2019s overall performance in the quarter and better-than-expected outlook for the third quarter. Meta reported revenue of $47.5 billion in the second quarter, with expectations to hit between $47.5 billion and $50.5 billion in Q3. Advertising drove Meta\u2019s revenue gains, fueled by AI tools \u2014 like AI-powered translations and video generation \u2014 to help advertisers create more meaningful and targeted campaigns.\nThe company\u2019s Reality Labs segment, however, saw a $4.5 billion loss.\nThis article was updated to reflect Meta\u2019s additional paths to funding its AI infrastructure builds.\n\ntitle1:\nGitHub Copilot crosses 20 million all-time users\ndescription1:\nGitHub Copilot, an AI coding tool offered by Microsoft-owned GitHub, has now reached more than 20 million users, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company\u2019s earnings call Wednesday. A GitHub spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that this number represents \u201call-time users.\u201d\nThat means five million people have tried out GitHub Copilot for the first time in the last three months; the company reported in April the tool had reached 15 million users. Microsoft and GitHub don\u2019t report how many of these 20 million people have continued to use the AI coding tool on a monthly or daily basis \u2014 though those metrics are likely far lower.\nMicrosoft also reported GitHub Copilot, which is among the most popular AI coding tools offered today, is used by 90% of the Fortune 100. The product\u2019s growth among enterprise customers has also grown about 75% compared to last quarter, according to the company.\nAI coding tools are rising in popularity, and they seem to be one of the few AI products generating notable revenue. In 2024, Nadella said GitHub Copilot was a larger business than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018. In the year since, it seems GitHub Copilot\u2019s growth rate has continued in a positive direction.\nThe world\u2019s most popular AI coding tools still have tiny user bases compared to AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, which attract hundreds of millions of users every month. Of course, software engineering is more niche than the general informational queries offered by AI chatbots.\nThat said, software engineers and their employers seem to be willing to pay a premium for AI coding tools. And with Microsoft\u2019s long list of enterprise customers and GitHub\u2019s ecosystem of developers, GitHub Copilot is well positioned to dominate the market for enterprise AI coding tools.\nCursor, another popular AI coding tool, wants to challenge GitHub Copilot in the enterprise, and it\u2019s been scooping up talent from fledgling AI startups to do so. Cursor reportedly had more than a million people using its product every day in March, according to Bloomberg. At that time, the company generated about $200 million in annualized recurring revenue. Today, Cursor\u2019s ARR is more than $500 million, suggesting there are now a lot more people using its products everyday.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWhile GitHub Copilot and Cursor initially sought to tackle different parts of the developer experience, they\u2019re steadily converging into similar products.\nBoth companies have recently introduced AI agents to review code and catch bugs introduced by humans. Github and Cursor are also both trying to create AI agents that automate programmer workflows, allowing developers to offload tasks altogether. Nadella said during Wednesday\u2019s earnings call that GitHub was seeing great momentum with their AI coding agents.\nBeyond Cursor, GitHub has an array of well-capitalized competitors that would like to sell AI coding tools to the enterprise.\nThere\u2019s Google \u2014 which acquired the leaders of AI coding startup Windsurf \u2014 as well as Cognition, the maker of Devin that subsequently acquired the rest of Windsurf\u2019s team. That\u2019s not to mention OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both building out their own AI coding offerings powered by in-house AI models, Codex and Claude Code respectively, in an attempt to win the market.\nThe nascent space is quickly heating up into one of AI\u2019s most competitive markets.\n\ntitle2:\nZuckerberg says people without AI glasses will be at a disadvantage in the future\ndescription2:\nEchoing sentiments shared in his \u201csuperintelligence\u201d-focused blog post this morning, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expanded on his bullish ideas that glasses will be the primary way users interact with AI in the years ahead. During Meta\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, the social networking exec told investors he believes people without AI glasses will be at a disadvantage in the future.\n\u201cI continue to think that glasses are basically going to be the ideal form factor for AI, because you can let an AI see what you see throughout the day, hear what you hear, [and] talk to you,\u201d Zuckerberg said during the earnings call. Adding a display to those glasses will then unlock more value, he said, whether that\u2019s a wider, holographic field of view, as with Meta\u2019s next-gen Orion AR glasses, or a smaller display that might ship in everyday AI eyewear.\n\u201cI think in the future, if you don\u2019t have glasses that have AI \u2014 or some way to interact with AI \u2014 I think you\u2019re \u2026 probably [going to] be at a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people,\u201d Zuckerberg added.\nMeta has been focused on building smart glasses, like its Ray-Ban Meta glasses and, more recently, Oakley Meta glasses. The glasses let users listen to music, take photos or videos, and ask Meta AI questions, including about what they\u2019re seeing, among other things. These wearables have turned into a surprise hit for the company, as revenue from sales of the Ray-Ban Metas more than tripled year-over-year, according to glasses giant EssilorLuxottica.\nBut Zuckerberg believes there\u2019s more to be done with displays.\n\u201cThis is \u2026 what we\u2019ve been maxing out with Reality Labs over the last 5 to 10 years \u2014 basically doing the research on all these different things,\u201d he said.\nThe Reality Labs division has been a money pit for the company, so it\u2019s not surprising the exec wants to justify its cost to investors by positioning it as a bet on the future of AI and consumer computing in general. For example, Meta said Reality Labs\u2019 operating loss was $4.53 billion in the second quarter. Since 2020, the unit has lost nearly $70 billion.\nHowever, the future of consumer AI may or may not be in the form of glasses. This spring, OpenAI acquired former Apple executive Jony Ive\u2019s startup in a $6.5 billion deal to build new consumer devices for interacting with AI. Already, other startups have dabbled in this area as well, including in form factors like AI pins \u2014 such as with Humane\u2019s flop \u2014 and pendents, like those from Limitless and Friend.\nGlasses, for now, seem to make the most sense, as many people already wear them, and they\u2019re more socially acceptable. But the world didn\u2019t know it needed smartphones, either, until someone dreamed them up. The next AI device could be something we can\u2019t even imagine yet.\nStill, Zuckerberg cheers the idea that glasses are going to be it.\n\u201cThe other thing that\u2019s awesome about glasses is they are going to be the ideal way to blend the physical and digital worlds together,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the whole Metaverse vision, I think, is going to \u2026 end up being extremely important, too, and AI is going to accelerate that.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nFigma's IPO price hit a $19.3B valuation out of the gate\ndescription3:\nFigma will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday in one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2025. The IPO is 40x oversubscribed, VCs confirmed to TechCrunch and Bloomberg previously reported.\nThat means demand for shares is 40x the number of shares the company and its existing investors are selling. So it should surprise no one that Figma, which offers design software, has priced its initial shares at $33 per share, above its previously announced range.\nOn Monday, the company said its expected price range was $30 to $32, up from a previously announced range of $25 to $28. At the final $33 price, the offering raised $1.2 billion. Most of that money is going to existing shareholders who are selling about twice as many shares (including founder and CEO Dylan Field) as the company itself has offered.\nThe IPO price values Figma at $19.3 billion, CNBC reports, near the $20 billion price Adobe would have paid before its deal to buy Figma fell apart in 2023 under pressure from regulators.\"\n\nResponse:",
