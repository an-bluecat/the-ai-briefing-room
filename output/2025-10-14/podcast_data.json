Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday October 15), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nGoogle's Gemini can now help you schedule Google Calendar meetings\ndescription0:\nGoogle is launching a new tool that uses AI to make it easier for Gmail users with Google Calendar to schedule their meetings. On Tuesday, the company launched a Gemini-powered \u201cHelp me schedule\u201d feature that will surface ideal meeting times based on calendar availability and then display them to the person you\u2019re emailing to set up a meeting.\nThe company notes that the feature is designed to work for one-on-one meetings, not those with multiple contacts or group meetings.\nThe launch of the new feature comes amid a flurry of Google Workspace announcements that focus on infusing AI more deeply into users\u2019 everyday tools. This includes the introduction of Google\u2019s latest image editing model, Nano Banana, and Gemini features in Google Slides; tools to share custom AI assistants called Gems with other team members; new formats in NotebookLM; improved AI video tools in Google Vids; and more.\nImage Credits:Google\nTo use the meeting scheduling option, you\u2019ll click the new \u201cHelp me schedule\u201d button that appears below your email compose screen in Gmail. This will display a series of timeslots where you have open availability. You can click an edit button to change or remove some of the options, then insert them into your email and send it to the recipient as usual. When the recipient picks a time that works for them, the calendar invite automatically appears on both people\u2019s calendars.\nWhile there are several meeting assistants and automated scheduling tools already on the market, like those from Calendly, Doodle, Zoom, HubSpot, and others, Google notes that its tool uses Gemini\u2019s AI to use the email\u2019s context when it makes its meeting suggestions. For instance, if someone writes in the email that they\u2019d like to book a 30-minute time slot next, then the meeting assistant will only suggest half-hour slots before the end of next week that fit your schedule.\nGoogle previously offered an appointment scheduling feature in Google Calendar, but it wasn\u2019t integrated with Gmail, nor did it use AI.\nSeparately, Google updated another Workplace feature on Tuesday, noting that Google Keep reminders will now automatically be saved to Google Tasks.\n\ntitle2:\nCoinbase boosts investment in India's CoinDCX, valuing exchange at $2.45B\ndescription2:\nCoinbase has increased its investment in India\u2019s CoinDCX, valuing the exchange at $2.45 billion post-money, as the U.S. crypto giant bets on the country\u2019s digital-asset potential even as regulation remains unclear.\nThe investment is an extension of CoinDCX\u2019s previous funding round and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions, the companies said on Wednesday. They did not disclose the amount invested or the size of Coinbase\u2019s stake, but noted that the new round increased the Indian exchange\u2019s valuation from $2.15 billion in its last raise in April 2022.\nCoinDCX confirmed to TechCrunch that the latest funding is an investment of new capital by Coinbase. The U.S. exchange has been an investor in CoinDCX since 2020 and last backed the Indian exchange in its Series D round in 2022 through its venture capital arm, Coinbase Ventures.\nNotably, the funding comes just months after CoinDCX suffered a security breach in July that led to the theft of around $44 million worth of assets. It comes amid reports earlier this year suggesting that Coinbase was acquiring CoinDCX \u2014 claims that the Indian exchange\u2019s CEO denied at the time.\n\u201cThis investment adds to our growing presence in the region, where we also maintain local operations and other important local partners,\u201d said Coinbase\u2019s chief business officer, Shan Aggarwal, in a blog post. \u201cTaken together, these steps reflect a clear commitment: we believe India and its neighbors will help shape the future of the global onchain economy.\u201d\nMore than a year after ceasing operations in India, Coinbase re-entered the market earlier this year by registering with the country\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit. The U.S. exchange is also an investor in CoinSwitch, another leading Indian crypto platform.\nIndia, the world\u2019s most populous country and home to more than a billion internet subscribers, is a key market for U.S. tech giants. However, the South Asian nation remains a relatively small market for crypto, partly due to regulatory uncertainty and the government\u2019s flat 30% tax on digital asset gains, along with a 1% levy on each transaction. New Delhi also restricts offshore crypto exchanges unless they register with its financial watchdog. Recently, 25 global platforms \u2014 including BingX, LBank, and CoinW \u2014 came under government scrutiny for failing to register and comply with anti\u2013money laundering rules.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nCoinbase\u2019s move to double down on CoinDCX to expand its presence in India makes strategic sense, as the Indian exchange has a strong local footprint with more than 20.4 million users. In July, CoinDCX reported customer assets exceeding \u20b9100 billion (about $1.12 billion), annualized group revenue of \u20b911.79 billion (around $133 million), and annualized transaction volumes across products totaling \u20b913.7 trillion (roughly $154.6 billion).\nIn addition to India, CoinDCX expanded into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) last year by acquiring BitOasis. Coinbase could leverage that footprint to strengthen its presence in the region, one of the fastest-growing crypto markets globally.\nThe new capital will be used to enhance products, drive user growth, expand into new geographies, and deepen educational initiatives, CoinDCX said in a statement.\n\u201cWe see strong synergies with Coinbase in building a compliant and regulatory-friendly crypto ecosystem in India, MENA, and beyond,\u201d Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, said.\n\ntitle3:\nSpotify partners with Netflix for video podcast distribution deal\ndescription3:\nSpotify is bringing its video podcasts to Netflix starting next year, the company announced on Tuesday. Amid the company\u2019s push to further expand its video content selection and boost its ads business, Spotify has announced a partnership with Netflix that will showcase select video podcasts on the popular streaming service.\nAt launch, the Netflix-Spotify partnership will bring a curated selection of sports, culture, lifestyle, and true crime podcasts from Spotify Studios and The Ringer to Netflix. Over time, the deal will see Spotify adding even more podcasts from other studios and genres, Spotify said.\nThe move follows Spotify\u2019s increased focus on video podcasts, beginning with the launch of tools that made it possible for anyone to publish their shows as videos. Over the past year, the company has added incentives that paid podcaster hosts for their popular videos and launched a Partner Program so hosts could monetize their video content, in a challenge to YouTube.\nSpotify has also recently rolled out a number of social tools that let hosts engage their audiences, including polls, Q&As, comments, and more.\nSpotify\u2019s interest in streaming video comes after a major shift in its podcast strategy back in 2023, which included layoffs, including that of chief content and business officer Dawn Ostroff, who had led its podcast initiatives. During Ostroff\u2019s time at the service, Spotify had invested billions in podcasts, buying studios like Parcast, The Ringer, and Gimlet Media, and signing exclusive podcast deals with big names like Joe Rogan and Alex Cooper, which have since expired.\nHowever, Spotify\u2019s investments failed to turn into substantial profits, necessitating a new strategy. Video, which is heavily consumed by Gen Z users in particular, offers more opportunities for ad products and monetization, the company now believes. As of Q2 2025, the company said it now has more than 430,000 video podcasts on its service, and video consumption is growing 20x faster than audio-only consumption since 2024. More than 350 million Spotify users have also streamed a video on its platform, up 65% year-over-year.\nReached for comment, Spotify declined to share the details of its deal with Netflix, in terms of ad-sharing or monetization.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Other global markets will follow.\n\u201cThis partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,\u201d said Spotify VP and Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenm\u00fcller, in an announcement. \u201cTogether with Netflix, we\u2019re expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity,\u201d he added.\nSpotify\u2019s stock declined after its last earnings release in July as the company\u2019s ad-supported revenues dropped despite a growing user and subscriber base. The company told investors at the time that it still believed in its overall strategy and its ability to turn around its programmatic ad business.\nThe following Spotify shows are included in the distribution partnership:\n\ntitle4:\nMozilla's Firefox adds Perplexity's AI answer engine as a new search option\ndescription4:\nWhile AI companies, startups, and others are rolling out their own web browsers that embed AI services deep into the web surfing experience, Mozilla\u2019s Firefox is instead allowing its customers to swap out their default search engine for an AI-powered search option in the browser they already use. The company on Tuesday announced that it\u2019s bringing AI answer engine Perplexity to Firefox, letting customers decide whether they want to use AI to search the web and find new information.\nMozilla had previously announced it was testing the integration, but the option was only available in select markets, including the U.S., U.K., and Germany. It was not yet determined if Perplexity would become a permanent addition to Firefox\u2019s list of web search providers, alongside others like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo.\nImage Credits:Mozilla\nNow, the company says that positive user feedback has pushed it to make Perplexity available to its global users on the desktop. It will arrive on mobile devices in the months ahead.\nOnce enabled, Perplexity offers a conversational search experience where answers appear with citations, as opposed to a list of web links, as with Google\u2019s traditional search. The option will appear in the unified search button in the address bar, which lets you quickly switch to search with Perplexity as needed. Users can also configure their default search provider in Firefox\u2019s settings.\nMozilla had earlier said that if the Perplexity pilot was successful, it would look to add more AI answer engines or search options to its browser in the future. (It likely started with Perplexity because the company says it won\u2019t share or sell users\u2019 personal data.)\nAlongside news of the AI search option, Mozilla also noted it\u2019s making its browser profiles broadly available to all users after months of tests and a gradual rollout. This feature lets you switch between different browser setups, like those for work, school, or personal use.\nImage Credits:Mozilla\nPlus, the company continues to test visual search with Google Lens among those who set Google as their default search provider on the desktop.\"\n\nResponse:",
