Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The judge also recommended suspending Tesla\u2019s manufacturing license for 30 days, but the DMV stayed that order, too, according to Bloomberg News.\n\u201cThe DMV\u2019s decision today confirms that the department will hold every vehicle manufacturer to the highest safety standards to keep California\u2019s drivers, passengers and pedestrians protected,\u201d DMV director Steve Gordon said in a statement. \u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve in California\u2019s nation-leading and supportive innovation marketplace.\u201d\nTesla said in a post on X that: \u201cSales in California will continue uninterrupted.\u201d\n\u201cThis was a \u2018consumer protection\u2019 order about the use of the term \u2018Autopilot\u2019 in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there\u2019s a problem,\u201d the company wrote.\nAfter the 60-day window, Tesla can appeal the decision and should Tesla comply, the suspensions will be dropped. But it\u2019s not immediately clear what steps the DMV wants Tesla to take, beyond telling the company to \u201ctake action regarding its use of the term \u2018autopilot.\u2019\u201d The DMV did not immediately respond to a request for clarification, or to a request regarding Tesla\u2019s apparent plan to ignore the decision.\nTesla has faced multiple investigations from the California Attorney General, the Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission over similar allegations that its marketing around partial autonomy systems was misleading. The company has also faced (and now settled) a number of personal civil lawsuits over crashes involving its Autopilot technology.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe case brought by the CA DMV has been winding through the state\u2019s Office of Administrative Hearings for years. The agency essentially accused Tesla of making customers believe that its advanced driver assistance systems were capable of high levels of autonomy. This led to overconfidence in the systems, the DMV alleged, which has contributed to dozens of crashes and multiple deaths. Tesla refuted these claims by saying its marketing was protected speech.\nA shutdown of sales in California, even temporary, could have a major impact on Tesla\u2019s business as it remains the company\u2019s largest market in the United States. A manufacturing suspension could also hurt Tesla\u2019s business. While the company has constructed a massive factory in Austin, Texas (and moved its official headquarters to the same location), it still relies on its Fremont, California factory to make hundreds of thousands of vehicles, including all North American-bound Model 3 sedans.\nThe judge\u2019s decision comes at a moment when Tesla is advancing its Robotaxi service test in Austin. Over the weekend, the company removed the safety monitors from its small fleet in the city. It had been offering rides to customers in the city for the last six months, but with a safety monitor either in the driver\u2019s or passenger\u2019s seat. Those vehicles are running a different version of Tesla\u2019s driving software than what the automaker\u2019s customers have in their cars, CEO Elon Musk has said.\nThis story has been updated to include information from the DMV\u2019s press release and Tesla\u2019s response.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI continues on its 'code red' warpath with new image generation model\ndescription1:\nOpenAI is rolling out a new version of ChatGPT Images that promises better instruction-following, more precise editing, and up to 4x faster image generation speeds.\nThe new model, dubbed GPT Image 1.5, is available starting Tuesday to all ChatGPT users and via the API. It\u2019s the latest escalation in the competition with Google\u2019s Gemini after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month declared a \u201ccode red\u201d in a leaked internal memo. The memo detailed OpenAI\u2019s plans to regain its position as the AI leader after Google had begun to take market share following the release of Gemini 3, its latest flagship model, and Nano Banana Pro, the newest version of Google\u2019s viral image generator \u2014 both of which have topped the LMArena leaderboard across multiple benchmarks.\nGoogle maintains its lead even after OpenAI responded to its success last week with the launch of GPT-5.2, pitching it as its most advanced model yet for developers and everyday professional use. OpenAI had reportedly been planning to release a new image generator in early January, accelerating those plans with this week\u2019s announcement. Its last image model release was GPT Image 1 in April.\nGPT Image 1.5 arrives as image and video generators advance beyond prototypes and gain more production-ready capabilities. Like Nano Banana Pro, ChatGPT Image offers post-production features, providing more granular edit controls to maintain visual consistency, like facial likeness, lighting, composition, and color tone across edits.\nThe same image depicted above with different edits to showcase GPT Image 1.5\u2019s improved instruction-following Image Credits:OpenAI\nMost GenAI image tools are bad at iteration, so this would be a huge step up. Asked for a specific change, like \u201cadjust the facial expression\u201d or \u201cmake lighting colder,\u201d models will often reinterpret the entire image, leading to a lack of consistency.\nThe update isn\u2019t just about new features. ChatGPT images will also now be accessible via a dedicated entry point in the ChatGPT sidebar that works \u201cmore like a creative studio,\u201d Fidji Simo, OpenAI\u2019s CEO of applications, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.\n\u201cThe new image viewing and editing screens make it easier to create images that match your vision or get inspiration from trending prompts and preset filters,\u201d Simo wrote.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nOn top of the new image generator, OpenAI is introducing new ways to improve the ChatGPT experience with more visual elements. The plan is to make search queries display more visuals with clear sources, which could be helpful for tasks like converting measurements or checking sports scores, per Simo.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re creating, you should be able to see and shape the thing you\u2019re making. When visuals tell a story better than words alone, ChatGPT should include them,\u201d Simo wrote. \u201cWhen you need a quick answer or the next step lives in another tool, it should be right there. As we do this, we can keep closing the distance between what\u2019s in your mind and your ability to bring it to life.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nMeta's AI glasses can now help you hear conversations better\ndescription2:\nMeta announced on Tuesday an update to its AI glasses that will allow you to better hear people talking when you\u2019re in a noisy environment. The feature will initially become available on Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the U.S. and Canada, the company says. In addition, the glasses are getting another update that lets you use Spotify to play a song that matches what\u2019s in your current view.\nFor instance, if you\u2019re looking at an album cover, the glasses could play a song by that artist. Or if you\u2019re looking at your Christmas tree with a pile of gifts, you could play holiday music. This addition is more of a gimmick, of course, but it demonstrates how Meta is thinking about connecting what people see with actions they can take in their apps.\nThe conversation-focus feature, meanwhile, seems more practical. First announced at Meta\u2019s Connect conference earlier this year, the feature uses the AI glasses\u2019 open-ear speakers to amplify the voice of the person you\u2019re talking to. Meta says smart glasses wearers will also be able to adjust the amplification level by swiping the right temple of their glasses, or via the device settings. This will allow them to set the level more precisely to match their current environment, whether that\u2019s a busy restaurant or bar, club, commuter train, or anything else.\nHow well the feature works, of course, will still need to be tested. However, the idea of using smart accessories as tools to help with hearing isn\u2019t limited to Meta. Apple\u2019s AirPods already offer a Conversation Boost feature designed to help you focus on the person you\u2019re talking to, and the Pro models more recently added support for a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature as well.\nWhile the conversation-focus feature is limited to the U.S. and Canada, the Spotify feature is offered in English in a larger number of markets, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the U.K., and the U.S.\nThe software update (v21) will first become available to those who are enrolled in Meta\u2019s Early Access Program, which requires first joining a waitlist and being approved. It will later roll out more broadly.\n\ntitle3:\nX updates its terms, files countersuit to lay claim to the 'Twitter' trademark after newcomer's challenge\ndescription3:\nElon Musk\u2019s X is updating its Terms of Service to indicate it still lays claim to the \u201cTwitter\u201d trademark. The move to add this detail to the company\u2019s terms follows an announcement from a Virginia-based startup, which recently filed an application to trademark the term \u201cTwitter.\u201d\nThe startup, Operation Bluebird, claims that X had abandoned the brand \u201cTwitter\u201d by renaming its social networking service \u201cX.\u201d In its petition to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office filed on December 2, the startup pointed to a post from X owner Musk on July 23, 2023, which proclaimed that the social network would soon \u201cbid adieu to the twitter brand.\u201d\nX is now challenging that claim with a countersuit of its own. (A copy of the filing was shared with TechCrunch via IP trademark law firm Gerben IP; it\u2019s not yet showing in PACER as of the time of publication.) In the filing, X says that it continues to exclusively own the Twitter and Tweet trademarks and the bluebird logo.\nSince filing its petition for cancellation, Operation Bluebird has been collecting potential user sign-ups for its own social network at a website named Twitter.new. The effort is headed up by two lawyers, including founder Michael Peroff, based in Illinois, and Stephen Coates, previously a trademark lawyer at Twitter. Given their backgrounds, their assertion that they plan to launch a new service to rival X seems dubious. It\u2019s more likely they want to acquire the trademark, which has value of its own.\nNevertheless, X isn\u2019t taking its chances. Its revised Terms of Service, effective as of January 15, 2026, states:\nNothing in the Terms gives you a right to use the X name or Twitter name or any of the X or Twitter trademarks, logos, domain names, other distinctive brand features, and other proprietary rights, and you may not do so without our express written consent.\nPreviously, the terms only referenced X in this section. There was no mention of Twitter.\nThe terms additionally include other, more minor updates, including mentions related to EU laws and generated content. X\u2019s Privacy Policy was also updated with a couple of references to age assurance technology.\nThis article was updated with a link to the countersuit following its initial publication.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle tests an email-based productivity assistant\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nProductivity is one space where companies keep wanting to experiment with AI assistants in the hope that they will save time for users, and as a result, they will want to use those assistants more. Google today launched one such experimental email-based assistant called CC through a Google Labs experiment.\nCC, which is powered by Gemini, can connect with your account, such as Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, and provide you with a daily brief via email. This \u201cYour Day Ahead\u201d email makes users aware of their tasks, summarizes their calendar, and provides key updates for the day from these accounts.\nYou can also reply to or email CC at any time with requests such as adding to-dos, teaching it to your preferences, remembering notes, or searching for information.\nAt the moment, CC is available to AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S. and Canada who are 18 or above. The company said that the assistant is only available to consumer Google accounts at the moment and not Workspace accounts.\nThere are several examples of AI-powered email-based briefs and assistants. Sequoia-backed Mindy, which now works in the creator and marketing space, started as an email assistant. Other meeting notetakers like Read AI and Fireflies also send users a daily brief, but they might not have context from email and Drive. Huxe, an audio app created by former Google NotebookLM makers, creates a daily brief in the form of a podcast with data from your email, calendar, and news preferences.\"\n\nResponse:",
