Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

It projects some of the apps found on a user\u2019s phone onto the vehicle\u2019s infotainment display. Drivers are able to interact with these apps, including Apple Music, messaging, and navigation, through its voice assistant Siri.\nApple\u2019s next-generation CarPlay Ultra goes a step further, including the central touchscreen display and digital dashboard located right in front of the driver, and gives users control of certain vehicle settings.\nThis latest move would theoretically bring Google\u2019s Gemini, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT into the car, and at the risk of putting its own Siri assistant in the back seat.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle- and Microsoft-backed Terradot acquires carbon-removal competitor\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nCarbon-removal startup Terradot is acquiring competitor Eion, the two companies announced today. The sale was driven largely by big investors like sovereign wealth funds, which want to work with companies that can handle large contracts. Eion was simply too small, Eion CEO Anastasia Pavlovic Hans told The Wall Street Journal.\nBoth companies spread pulverized rocks on farm fields to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Known as enhanced rock weathering (EWR), it speeds up a natural process and has the potential to be a low-cost way to remove carbon, but it requires large and distributed operations. The spread between what EWR companies would like to charge and what buyers would like to pay remains wide, according to a survey by CDR.fyi.\nCalifornia-based Terradot\u2019s operations are centered on Brazil, where the company works with basalt as its mineral of choice, while Eion works in the U.S. and uses olivine. Terradot\u2019s investor list includes Gigascale Capital, Google, Kleiner Perkins, and Microsoft, while Eion\u2019s investors include AgFunder, Mercator Partners, and Overture.\n\ntitle2:\nReddit says it's looking for more acquisitions in adtech and elsewhere\ndescription2:\nReddit is gearing up for more M&A, the company told analysts on its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. Reddit CFO Andrew Vollero said the online forum site is looking for businesses that can either leverage Reddit\u2019s scale \u2014 meaning their products become more impactful when deployed across Reddit\u2019s massive user base \u2014 or help grow the company\u2019s user base.\n\u201c[We\u2019re] looking to buy capabilities, technologies, and companies,\u201d he said during the introductory remarks.\nInvestors, obviously, wanted to know more \u2014 particularly about what the company had in mind when it came to scaled opportunities.\nIn the Q&A portion of the call, Vollero clarified, \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t overthink the scaled opportunities. I would just look at it as sort of a spectrum of opportunities.\u201d He reiterated that the company was looking for capabilities and technologies that could add to its business, noting that it\u2019s been successful doing this in the past.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really been one of the secrets of our success,\u201d he pointed out.\nVollero explained that Reddit\u2019s adtech team in particular had been adept at \u201ctucking in\u201d acquired technologies rather than building these things themselves.\n\u201cSaves us six months to market, saves us twelve months to market, and you have a proven product,\u201d the CFO remarked, crediting these deals with helping Reddit improve its monetization capabilities as an ad-supported business.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nStill, Vollero cautioned that while adtech acquisitions have been what worked in the past, the company is \u201cnot ruling anything off the table.\u201d That\u2019s why he had mentioned that Reddit might buy companies that could deliver when added to a company of its size.\nThe company in the quarter reported strong earnings, with $726 million in revenue, $690 million of which came from ads. Its global daily active unique users were up 19% year-over-year to 121.4 million, and its earnings per share of $1.24 beat estimates.\nReddit also said it sees a growing opportunity of generating revenue from its AI search product in the future, which raises the question as to whether the company is looking to this area for M&A, too.\nReddit, which has been ramping up its AI investments in recent months, including an AI search engine, has acquired startups before. In recent years, it snapped up adtech players and AI optimization tools, including Memorable AI in August 2024.\nDesigned to enhance Reddit\u2019s advertising tools, the acquisition joined a handful of others from 2022, including AI platform Spell, designed to boost Reddit\u2019s machine learning capabilities; Spiketrap, which focused on improved ad targeting; Oterlu, which developed machine-learning moderation tools; and MeaningCloud, another startup bought to improve Reddit\u2019s machine-learning and text analytics capabilities.\n\ntitle3:\nFrom Svedka to Anthropic, brands make bold plays with AI in Super Bowl ads\ndescription3:\nFollowing last year\u2019s trend of showcasing AI in multimillion-dollar ad spots, the 2026 Super Bowl advertisements took it a step further by leveraging AI both to create the commercials and to promote the latest AI products. Love it or hate it, the technology has become a star in its own right, alongside the latest movie trailers and snack brands.\nLet\u2019s explore the biggest moments from this year\u2019s Big Game ads, which featured everything from robots and AI glasses to a touch of drama involving tech founders.\nSvedka\nVodka brand Svedka went with what it touts as the first \u201cprimarily\u201d AI-generated national Super Bowl spot. The 30-second ad, titled \u201cShake Your Bots Off,\u201d features the company\u2019s robot character, Fembot, and her new companion, Brobot, dancing their circuits off at a human party.\nAccording to Svedka\u2019s parent company, Sazerac, it took roughly four months to reconstruct the Fembot and train the AI to mimic facial expressions and body movements, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, the vodka brand noted that certain aspects were still handled by humans, such as developing the storyline.\n\u200bThe company partnered with AI company Silverside to create the Super Bowl spot, according to ADWEEK. Silverside AI is the same team behind recent AI-generated Coca-Cola commercials that sparked controversy.\n\u200bIt\u2019s a bold move to debut AI-generated content during the Super Bowl, an event known for star-studded, high-production ads. The heavy reliance on AI is polarizing, fueling debates over whether AI will replace creative jobs.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nEither way, Svedka definitely got people talking.\nAnthropic\nAnthropic\u2019s ad wasn\u2019t just about selling its Claude chatbot; it was about throwing shade. The commercial took a jab at OpenAI\u2019s plan to introduce ads to ChatGPT, with a tagline: \u201cAds are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\u201d Rather than focus solely on Claude\u2019s features, it poked fun at the idea of your helpful AI assistant suddenly turning into a hype man for \u201cStep Boost Maxx\u201d insoles, for example.\nIt wasn\u2019t a standard product pitch, and it escalated into an online feud. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman fired back on social media, calling the ad \u201cclearly dishonest.\u201d So while we didn\u2019t get any more Kendrick vs. Drake rap beef this time around, maybe we did get our own AI, nerdy version of it.\nMeta spotlighted its Oakley-branded AI glasses, designed for sports, workouts, and adventures, including extreme scenarios such as chasing down a departing plane.\nThe ad showcased thrill-seekers, from skydivers to mountain bikers, using the glasses to capture epic moments. Famous faces like IShowSpeed and filmmaker Spike Lee made appearances, demonstrating capabilities like filming a basketball dunk in slow motion, posting hands-free to Instagram, and other advanced features.\nThe tech giant also featured its wearable AI tech in last year\u2019s Super Bowl ad to spark consumer interest, with stars like Chris Pratt, Chris Hemsworth, and Kris Jenner showing off Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\nAmazon\nAmazon\u2019s ad took a cheeky (and slightly unsettling) approach, starring Chris Hemsworth in a satirical \u201cAI is out to get me\u201d storyline. The commercial exaggerates common fears about AI, with Hemsworth humorously accusing Alexa+ of plotting against him. Scenes included Alexa+ closing the garage door on his head and shutting the pool cover while he swam, each mishap escalating in absurdity.\nBeyond the dark comedy, the ad introduced the new Alexa+, showcasing its enhanced intelligence and capabilities, ranging from managing smart home devices to planning vacations. Alexa+ had been available in early access for over a year and officially launched to all U.S. users on Wednesday.\nRing\nRing\u2019s commercial spotlighted its \u201cSearch Party\u201d feature, which leverages AI and a community network to reunite lost pets with their owners. The ad followed a young girl searching for her dog Milo, illustrating how users can upload a pet\u2019s photo to the app, where AI works to identify matches and taps into nearby cameras and the broader Ring user community to help track down missing furry family members.\nRing recently announced that anyone can now use Search Party, even without owning a Ring security camera. According to the company, the feature has already helped reunite more than one lost dog with its owner every day.\nGoogle\nGoogle\u2019s ad showcased the Nano Banana Pro, its newest image-generation model. The commercial followed a mother and son as they used AI to envision and design their new home, uploading photos of bare rooms and turning them into personalized spaces with just a few prompts.\nRamp\nRamp scored big by getting Brian Baumgartner \u2014 the actor who played Kevin in \u201cThe Office\u201d \u2014 for its Super Bowl commercial.\nIn the spot, Baumgartner uses Ramp\u2019s AI-powered spend management platform to \u201cmultiply\u201d himself, effortlessly tackling a mountain of work. The ad highlights how Ramp\u2019s all-in-one solution helps teams focus on the most important tasks through smart automation.\nAnd, as a playful nod to his TV persona, Baumgartner is seen carrying a pot of chili in the ad, referencing Kevin\u2019s legendary scene where he brings his cherished recipe for his co-workers to try, only to disastrously spill the entire pot on the floor.\nRippling\nRippling, the cloud-based workforce management platform, went all in on its first-ever Super Bowl ad. The company tapped comedian Tim Robinson in a spot about onboarding an alien monster, poking fun at HR headaches and the promise of AI automation.\nHims & Hers\nHealth company Hims & Hers used its Super Bowl spot to address disparities in healthcare access. The ad cleverly references the lengths the wealthy go to for health and longevity, even appearing to poke fun at Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin spaceflight in 2021 and Bryan Johnson\u2019s expensive anti-aging routines.\nIn recent years, the company launched an AI-powered \u201cMedMatch\u201d tool to deliver more personalized treatment recommendations, especially for mental health and wellness.\nWix\nWebsite builder Wix spotlighted its new AI-powered Wix Harmony platform, promising website creation as easy as chatting with a friend. Unveiled in January, the flagship platform combines AI-driven creation and \u201cvibe coding\u201d with full visual editing and customization.\nWix\u2019s biggest competitor, Squarespace, also has a Super Bowl ad this year. Squarespace\u2019s ad has a more cinematic approach starring Emma Stone and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos.\n\ntitle4:\n'Industry' season 4 captures tech fraud better than any show on TV right now\ndescription4:\nHBO\u2019s hit financial thriller \u201cIndustry\u201d has delivered one of its most compelling storylines yet this season: a hunt to expose a fraudulent fintech company called Tender.\nThe show follows Harper Stern, who\u2019s leading her newly launched investment firm and looking for a company to short \u2014 essentially, betting that its stock will crash. After a journalist tips her off that something\u2019s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.\nWhat they discover is damning. \u201cFake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,\u201d Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. \u201cThe thing is nothing.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about this season of \u201cIndustry\u201d is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) Online Safety Bill that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online. Because of its affiliation with adult content, Tender finds itself at odds with the new government\u2019s regulation and must pivot or die, as the saying goes.\nImage Credits:HBO\nIts CFO-turned-leader, Whitney, wants the company to pivot into a bank and has a plan to make that happen, including making Tender\u2019s CEO, Henry, the face of that transformation. Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He\u2019s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.\nHarper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years). She has teamed up with new friends and old frenemies and is looking for blood \u2014 meaning a company on the precipice of crashing. To her, Tender is that company.\nThis puts her at odds with her friend Yasmin, who is married to Henry and is crafting communication and lobbying strategies for Tender. It\u2019s pride and prejudice \u2014 the sugar and spice that help make the world go round.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nImage Credits:HBO\nThe show nails the tech world with such accuracy that reality itself starts to feel like satire. Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender\u2019s media playbook.\nThere is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family\u2019s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the Jewish-sounding Halberstram. The character is perhaps a nod to the rising \u201ctechnofacism\u201d criticism of some tech barons.\nHarper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. \u201cMy real passion lies with finding dead men walking,\u201d she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm.\nShe is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?\n\u201cWho needs realism when she\u2019s such a great character,\u201d one Black British founder told me.\nHe said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he\u2019s seen that \u201caccurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.\u201d\n\u201cNepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,\u201d one European investor added.\nMeanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney\u2019s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes.\nImage Credits:HBO\nAn Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney.\nBy now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like Charlie Javice\u2019s Frank) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (the FTX crypto crash). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate implosion of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.\nWirecard admitted that the billions in cash it reported having likely never existed, despite the company\u2019s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones \u2014 much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender. Short sellers went after Wirecard, too, and one blog dubbed them \u201calternative whistleblowers\u201d \u2014 people who step in when \u201cthe market, and the regulator, refuse to see what is right in front of them.\u201d\nThe philosophy is one that one could easily see Harper embracing soon enough, especially after Eric tells her at one point that \u201cshort-only work is ugly, hard, investigative,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201canti-status quo, anti-establishment, anti-power.\u201d\nWith Wirecard, numerous people, including the CEO, were arrested, while the COO went on the run (and was also accused of being a Russian spy). Tender\u2019s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about \u201cIndustry\u201d is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.\nIt\u2019s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can\u2019t get enough.\"\n\nResponse:",
