The model, 3.1, is currently available as a preview and will be generally released soon, the company said.\nGoogle\u2019s new model may be one of the most powerful LLMs yet. Onlookers have noted that Gemini 3.1 Pro appears to be a big step up from its predecessor, Gemini 3 \u2014 which, upon its release in November, was already considered a highly capable AI tool.\nOn Thursday, Google also shared statistics from independent benchmarks \u2014 such as one called Humanity\u2019s Last Exam \u2014 that showed it performing significantly better than its previous version.\nGemini 3.1 Pro was also praised by Brendan Foody, the CEO of AI startup Mercor, whose benchmarking system, APEX, is designed to measure how well new AI models perform real professional tasks. \u201cGemini 3.1 Pro is now at the top of the APEX-Agents leaderboard,\u201d Foody said in a social media post, adding that the model\u2019s impressive results show \u201chow quickly agents are improving at real knowledge work.\u201d\nThe release comes as the AI model wars are heating up, and tech companies continue to release increasingly powerful LLMs designed for agentic work and multi-step reasoning. Other major names \u2014 including OpenAI and Anthropic \u2014 have recently released new models as well.\n\ntitle1:\nFBI says ATM 'jackpotting' attacks are on the rise, and netting hackers millions in stolen cash\ndescription1:\nIn 2010, the famed security researcher Barnaby Jack spectacularly hacked into an ATM cash machine onstage at the Black Hat security conference, forcing it to spit out reams of bank notes in front of an awestruck audience.\nMore than a decade later, ATM jackpotting \u2014 as it\u2019s called \u2014 has broken free from the realms of theoretical security research into big business in the criminal world.\nAccording to a new security bulletin issued by the FBI, hackers have rapidly ramped up their attacks in recent years, with more than 700 attacks on cash dispensers during 2025 alone, netting hackers at least $20 million in stolen cash.\nPer the bulletin, the FBI says hackers are using a mix of physical access to ATM machines, such as generic keys for unlocking front panels and accessing hard drives, and digital tools, like planting malware that can force ATMs to rapidly dispense cash in a flash.\nThe FBI warned that one particular malware, known as Ploutus, affects a variety of ATM manufacturers and cash dispensers by targeting the underlying Windows operating system that powers many ATMs. Ploutus grants the hackers full control over a compromised ATM, allowing them to issue instructions capable of tricking the dispenser into disbursing notes without drawing funds from customer accounts.\nPloutus takes advantage of extensions for financial services, or XFS software, which ATMs rely on to communicate with its various other hardware components, such as the PIN keypad, the card reader, and the all-important cash dispensing unit.\n\u201cPloutus attacks the ATM itself rather than customer accounts, enabling fast cash-out operations that can occur in minutes and are often difficult to detect until after the money is withdrawn,\u201d per the FBI bulletin.\nSecurity researchers previously found issues with XFS software that can allow hackers to trick ATMs into dispensing cash.\nBarnaby Jack, the late security researcher credited with the first ATM \u201cjackpotting\u201d attacks Image Credits:YouTube\nUpdated the lede paragraph to amend date.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia deepens early-stage push into India's AI startup ecosystem\ndescription2:\nNvidia is stepping up efforts to court India\u2019s artificial intelligence startups earlier in their lifecycle, unveiling a string of partnerships this week aimed at reaching founders even before their companies are formally established. The push is intended to help the AI chipmaker cultivate relationships with future customers in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing developer markets.\nThe latest move comes through a partnership with early-stage venture firm Activate, which plans to back about 25 to 30 AI startups from its $75 million debut fund while giving portfolio companies preferential access to Nvidia\u2019s technical expertise. The collaboration follows other India-focused efforts unveiled this week, including work with nonprofit AI Grants India to support early-stage founders and new ties with venture firms focused on the South Asian nation.\nThe flurry of activity comes as India hosts its AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, drawing top technology companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang was slated to attend but skipped the event due to what the company called unforeseen circumstances. A senior delegation led by executive vice president Jay Puri attended in his place, meeting AI researchers, startups, developers, and partners on the ground.\nIndia has emerged as one of the fastest-growing pools of AI developers and startups, making it an increasingly important market for Nvidia as it looks to expand adoption of chips and computing software. By working more closely with founders at the earliest stages, the company is positioning itself to capture long-term demand as new AI-native companies scale.\nAakrit Vaish, founder of Activate, said Nvidia\u2019s engagement with startups in India has historically been relatively light-touch compared with the U.S., but the chipmaker is now looking to work with founders much earlier in their journey. Activate aims to leverage that shift by connecting portfolio startups directly with Nvidia experts.\nThe VC firm, which Vaish describes as focused on \u201cinception investing,\u201d meets technical teams months before company formation and works closely with them as they grow. Its backers include venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Perplexity co-founder Aravind Srinivas, Peak XV managing director Shailendra Singh, and Paytm CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma, underlining the prominent network Activate is assembling around its early-stage strategy.\nFor Nvidia, the logic behind partnering with an early-stage venture firm is straightforward: the earlier it builds relationships with promising AI startups, the more likely those companies are to rely on its computing infrastructure as they scale. Vaish told TechCrunch that growing startups typically consume increasing amounts of AI compute over time, making early technical engagement valuable for the chipmaker as a way of generating future business.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nNvidia already has a sizable presence in the country through its Inception program, which supports more than 4,000 startups in India. This week, the chipmaker also expanded its local ecosystem ties, including partnerships with venture firms such as Accel, Peak XV, Z47, Elevation Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners to identify and fund AI startups. It separately teamed up with AI Grants India, co-founded by Vaibhav Domkundwar and Bhasker (Bosky) Kode, to support more than 10,000 early-stage founders over the next 12 months.\nThe company has also been broadening its startup outreach in India over time. In November 2025, Nvidia joined the India Deep Tech Alliance, a consortium of U.S. and Indian investors including Accel, Blume Ventures, Premji Invest, and Celesta Capital, to provide strategic and technical guidance to emerging startups in the country.\nVaish said Activate\u2019s partnership with Nvidia is designed to provide a more curated layer on top of the company\u2019s broad-based Inception program, which serves thousands of startups globally. By serving as an early filter for high-potential technical teams, Activate aims to give its portfolio companies more direct, timely access to Nvidia\u2019s engineering expertise.\nThe stepped-up activity underscores intensifying competition among global technology firms to court AI developers and startups in India, which has become one of the fastest-growing pools of technical talent outside the U.S.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI reportedly finalizing $100B deal at more than $850B valuation\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI is nearing a deal to raise more than $100 billion at a valuation that could exceed $850 billion, Bloomberg reports, citing sources familiar with the matter.\nThe deal comes as the ChatGPT-maker burns through cash as it inches toward profitability. To that end, OpenAI has said it has started testing ads in ChatGPT for free users, a gamble that could lead to more revenue or could send users running from the platform.\nApparently investors think it\u2019s worth the risk if they\u2019re valuing the company $20 billion higher than the $830 billion valuation initially expected. The company\u2019s pre-money value will remain at $730 billion, per Bloomberg\u2019s source.\nThe first tranches of funding are reportedly coming from the usual suspects: Amazon (already in talks to invest up to $50 billion), SoftBank (gearing up for $30 billion), Nvidia (close to investing $20 billion), and Microsoft. VC firms and sovereign wealth funds are expected to close later, potentially bringing the total amount raised higher.\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nAn AI data center boom is fueling Redwood's energy storage business\ndescription4:\nA year ago, Redwood Materials didn\u2019t have an energy storage business. Now, it is the fastest-growing unit within the battery recycling and materials startup \u2014 a reflection of an AI data center building boom.\nThe evidence of that growth, the company says, can be found at its R&D lab in San Francisco, which has expanded four-fold into a 55,000-square-foot facility and now employs nearly 100 people. Those are small figures compared to Redwood\u2019s total workforce of 1,200 people and its sprawling campus at its Carson City, Nevada headquarters and another facility near Reno. But its value and recent expansion are tied directly to its burgeoning energy storage that launched in June 2025.\nThe San Francisco facility, which opened in April 2025, is where engineers integrate the hardware, software, and power electronics for energy storage systems that power data centers, AI computing, and other large-scale industrial applications.\nThe company said in a blog post Thursday the expansion will support a wave of energy storage deployments related to data centers. The company\u2019s recent $425 million Series E raise will provide the capital needed to scale the business. Google, a new investor, as well as existing backer Nvidia, joined the round to support Redwood\u2019s energy storage business venture.\n\u201cAI data centers have definitely been a pressing area of focus,\u201d Claire McConnell, vice president of business development told TechCrunch in a recent interview, who added there are other use cases for its systems including supporting renewable projects like solar and wind.\nData centers have been around for decades, but advancements in AI have spurred a building spree and a need for reliable electricity.\n\u201cWhat data center developers are seeing is something that they hadn\u2019t experienced before,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWhen they\u2019re trying to connect to the grid, they are being told it is going to take five-plus years to get that and at the same time, you\u2019re seeing this massive demand to build more data centers and compete in the AI race.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

It initially focused on recycling scrap from battery production and consumer electronics, which was processed and then sold to customers such as Panasonic. The company also expanded into the battery materials business and today produces cathodes for battery cells.\nThe company opened Redwood Energy last summer to leverage the thousands of EV batteries it has collected as part of its battery-recycling business to provide power to companies. Redwood Energy\u2019s first customer is Crusoe, a startup that, in 2021, Straubel invested in. Redwood set up an energy storage system that uses old EV batteries that are not yet ready for recycling. The system, which generates 12 MW of power and has 63 MWh of capacity, sends power to a modular data center built by Crusoe, a company best known for its large-scale data center campus in Abilene, Texas \u2014 the initial site of the Stargate project.\nMcConnell said customers that are in the pipeline include hyperscalers \u2014 companies that operate massive cloud computing data centers and consume hundreds of megawatts of power \u2014 that would far exceed the capacity of its project with Crusoe.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on ones in the hundreds of megawatt hours, and we have ones in the pipeline that are multiple gigawatt hours,\u201d she said.\"\n\nResponse:",
