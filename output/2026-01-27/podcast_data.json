Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas.

Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India.

ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The round, expected to close soon, will give the company a valuation of $350 billion, sources told the FT.\nAnthropic, which makes the popular AI Claude and the equally popular Claude Code, decided to double its funding target due to booming investor interest. Backers in this round are expected to include Sequoia Capital (which also invests in its rival OpenAI), Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, and investment management firm Coatue, per the FT.\nLate last year, it was reported that Anthropic hired lawyers as a step toward prepping for an IPO that could come sometime this year. The company announced a $13 billion raise in September, making it one of the industry\u2019s most valuable private companies, valued at $183 billion.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon agrees to pay consumers $309M in returns policy settlement\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nAmazon has reached a settlement valued at more than $1 billion to resolve claims that it failed to properly refund customers for their returns. The settlement includes more than $600 million already distributed or soon to be paid in refunds, plus additional funds that will be paid out to affected consumers, according to court documents.\nUnder the settlement, Amazon will pay $309.5 million into a non-reversionary common fund, a pool of money set aside for members of the class-action lawsuit. The company has already issued about $570 million in refunds, with about $34 million of refunds remaining. Reuters was first to report on the settlement.\nThe e-commerce giant has also agreed to provide over $363 million in non\u2011monetary relief to enhance its return and refund processes, according to court documents. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.\nThe lawsuit, filed in 2023, alleged that Amazon caused \u201csubstantial unjustified monetary losses\u201d for consumers who returned an item but were still charged for it.\n\u201cFollowing an internal review in 2025, we identified a small subset of returns where we issued a refund without the payment completing, or where we could not verify that the correct item had been sent back to us, so no refund had been issued,\u201d Amazon said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. \u201cWe started issuing refunds in 2025 for these returns and are providing additional compensation and refunds to eligible customers per the settlement agreement.\u201d\nAmazon agreed to pay $2.5 billion last year to settle the FTC\u2019s lawsuit that accused the company of tricking users into subscribing to Prime and making it difficult to cancel. Amazon is currently accepting claims from impacted customers.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle's more affordable AI Plus plan rolls out to all markets, including the US\ndescription2:\nGoogle on Tuesday announced its more affordable Google AI Plus plan is now available in all markets where its AI plans are available. This includes the U.S, where it will cost $7.99 per month.\nThe expansion brings the lower-cost plan to 35 new countries and territories, after earlier launches in dozens of global markets, which began with Indonesia last September.\nThe plan includes access to Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro in the Gemini app, Flow\u2019s AI filmmaking tools, research and writing assistance in NotebookLM, and more. It also offers 200GB of storage and the ability to share your plan benefits with up to five other family members.\nExisting Google One Premium 2TB subscribers will automatically gain access to all Google AI Plus plan benefits over the next few days, the company says.\nInitially focused on emerging markets, the Google AI Plus plan is designed as the first step beyond free access to Gemini and other AI tools for those who either don\u2019t need or can\u2019t afford to subscribe to the more expensive Google AI Pro plan, which is typically priced at $20 per month.\nWhile the Plus plan\u2019s price point varies by region, its $8 per month price point could introduce a new, more casual audience to Google\u2019s AI technology here in the United States. Elsewhere, the plan tends to cost less than $5 per month. For instance, users in India pay \u20b9399 ($4.44 USD) per month.\nWhen it first debuted, Google explained that the plan was designed to bring access to Gemini, Veo, and other creative AI tools to emerging markets at a more affordable price point. It\u2019s also designed to compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Go plan, which is $8 per month in the U.S., or less in some emerging markets. These plans are meant to attract the large online population of users who could become regular AI customers over time, giving companies a boost in their AI adoption numbers.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

In a regulatory filing, the company noted it expects to complete the layoffs by late September.\nThe filing stated that Pinterest would be \u201creallocating resources to AI-focused roles and teams that drive AI adoption and execution\u201d and \u201cprioritizing AI\u2011powered products and capabilities.\u201d\nThe company had 4,666 full-time employees at the end of 2024, which means roughly 700 workers will be affected by cuts.\nThe move comes as Pinterest, and every other tech company, has been investing in AI. A few months ago, the company launched \u201cPinterest Assistant,\u201d an AI companion users can talk to for shopping advice and recommendations. It also began experimenting with AI-powered personalized boards.\nDuring Pinterest\u2019s last earnings call, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready emphasized the promise of open source AI models to help the company keep costs down.\nThe company said it expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of about $35 million to $45 million.\n\ntitle4:\nTikTok joins Snap to settle social media addiction lawsuit\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nTikTok settled a high-profile lawsuit on Monday evening, which alleges that social media companies intentionally make their products addictive, causing harm to users. Snap settled the case last week, but Meta and YouTube \u2014 the other defendants \u2014 are now heading to trial, where jury selection begins on Tuesday.\nCentering around a 19-year-old plaintiff known by the initials K.G.M., this case is the first of many similar legal challenges against social platforms. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and YouTube head Neal Mohan are expected to testify, which could set a precedent for how dozens of other lawsuits could play out.\nBy settling the case, TikTok and Snap are not necessarily admitting to the allegations. Rather, they came to an agreement with the plaintiff outside of court, though the terms of these settlements are not known.\"\n\nResponse:",
