Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

This growth brings YouTube\u2019s total ad revenue to $9.8 billion, up from $8.7 billion in the same period last year.\nThe company slightly exceeded analyst expectations, which had forecast YouTube\u2019s Q2 ad revenue to be around $9.6 billion.\nFor years, YouTube has been striving to capture a larger share of television ad dollars, especially as its popularity on TV has grown, accounting for a significant portion of its viewership. A recent report from Nielsen indicated that YouTube held the largest share of TV viewing for three consecutive months, representing 12.4% of the total audience time spent watching television.\nIn response to YouTube\u2019s success, rival streaming services, such as HBO Max and Amazon Prime Video, have ramped up their advertising strategies, increasing ad placements to stimulate growth. Additionally, Netflix is emerging as a key competitor to YouTube, particularly after it announced its intentions to double its advertising revenue within the year during the company\u2019s earnings call last week. Although Netflix has not publicly disclosed its ad revenue figures, an analyst from Madison & Wall estimates that it\u2019s around $3 billion.\nOverall, Alphabet reported strong results, with total revenue of $96.4 billion in the second quarter, representing a 13% year-over-year increase.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle's AI Overviews have 2B monthly users, AI Mode 100M in the US and India\ndescription1:\nAlphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai shared an update on the adoption of consumer-facing AI apps and features, including Google Search\u2019s AI Overviews, Gemini, and AI Mode. On the company\u2019s Q2 2025 call with investors, Pichai shared that AI Overviews \u2014 a Google Search feature offering an AI summary of search results available in 200 countries and territories \u2014 now has 2 billion monthly users, up from 1.5 billion in May 2025.\nIn addition, Google\u2019s Gemini app has grown to 450 million monthly active users.\n\u201cWe continue to see strong growth and engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1,\u201d Pichai said of the app.\nMeanwhile, AI Mode \u2014 a way to use Google Search via an AI chat experience to get more in-depth answers \u2014 has over 100 million monthly active users, Pichai said. The service is available in the U.S. and, more recently, India, but is still rolling out. The CEO also said the experience will be upgraded in the near future with the addition of the advanced research tool, Deep Search, and more personalized responses.\nOn the developer front, Google said more than 9 million have built with Gemini and over 70 million videos have been produced with the Veo 3 AI model since May. Google Vids, a Veo-powered feature for text-to-video AI generation in Google Workspace, now has nearly 1 million monthly active users.\nIn Google Meet, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet, the company also said.\nThe stats are meant to illustrate consumer demand for AI features. For instance, Google shared that AI Overviews were driving over 10% more Google Search queries, for the types of searches that show them. However, it\u2019s arguably difficult to determine how many people have truly and willingly turned to AI in Search, when the features have been thrust upon them as aggressively as they have been.\nAcross Google\u2019s platform and products, Google quantified its growth by monthly tokens processed, saying that it had announced at its developer conference in May that it had processed 480 trillion monthly tokens, and that figure has now doubled to 980 trillion monthly tokens.\n\u201cWe are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio,\u201d Pichai told investors. \u201cOf course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated, full-stack approach to AI.\u201d\nInvestors, however, reacted negatively to Google\u2019s plans to increase its capital expenditure spending to keep up with the AI race, which sent the stock slipping shortly after earnings were announced.\n\ntitle2:\nTrump\u2019s \u2018anti-woke AI\u2019 order could reshape how US tech companies train their models\ndescription2:\nWhen DeepSeek, Alibaba, and other Chinese firms released their AI models, Western researchers quickly noticed they sidestepped questions critical of the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. officials later confirmed that these tools are engineered to reflect Beijing\u2019s talking points, raising concerns about censorship and bias.\nAmerican AI leaders like OpenAI have pointed to this as justification for advancing their tech quickly, without too much regulation or oversight. As OpenAI\u2019s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane wrote in a LinkedIn post last month, there is a contest between \u201cUS-led democratic AI and Communist-led China\u2019s autocratic AI.\u201d\nAn executive order signed Wednesday by President Donald Trump that bans \u201cwoke AI\u201d and AI models that aren\u2019t \u201cideologically neutral\u201d from government contracts could disrupt that balance.\nThe order calls out diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), calling it a \u201cpervasive and destructive\u201d ideology that can \u201cdistort the quality and accuracy of the output.\u201d Specifically, the order refers to information about race or sex, manipulation of racial or sexual representation, critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\nExperts warn it could create a chilling effect on developers who may feel pressure to align model outputs and datasets with White House rhetoric to secure federal dollars for their cash-burning businesses.\nThe order comes the same day the White House published Trump\u2019s \u201cAI Action Plan,\u201d which shifts national priorities away from societal risk and focuses instead on building out AI infrastructure, cutting red tape for tech companies, shoring up national security, and competing with China.\nThe order instructs the director of the Office of Management and Budget along with the administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the administrator of General Services, and the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to issue guidance to other agencies on how to comply.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cOnce and for all, we are getting rid of woke,\u201d Trump said Wednesday during an AI event hosted by the All-In Podcast and Hill & Valley Forum. \u201cI will be signing an order banning the federal government from procuring AI technology that has been infused with partisan bias or ideological agendas, such as critical race theory, which is ridiculous. And from now on the U.S. government will deal only with AI that pursues truth, fairness, and strict impartiality.\u201d\nDetermining what is impartial or objective is one of many challenges to the order.\nPhilip Seargeant, senior lecturer in applied linguistics at the Open University, told TechCrunch that nothing can ever be objective.\n\u201cOne of the fundamental tenets of sociolinguistics is that language is never neutral,\u201d Seargeant said. \u201cSo the idea that you can ever get pure objectivity is a fantasy.\u201d\nOn top of that, the Trump administration\u2019s ideology doesn\u2019t reflect the beliefs and values of all Americans. Trump has repeatedly sought to eliminate funding for climate initiatives, education, public broadcasting, research, social service grants, community and agricultural support programs, and gender-affirming care, often framing these initiatives as examples of \u201cwoke\u201d or politically biased government spending.\nAs Rumman Chowdhury, a data scientist, CEO of the tech nonprofit Humane Intelligence, and former U.S. science envoy for AI, put it, \u201cAnything [the Trump administration doesn\u2019t] like is immediately tossed into this pejorative pile of woke.\u201d\nThe definitions of \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d and \u201cideological neutrality\u201d in the order published Wednesday are vague in some ways and specific in others. While \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d is defined as LLMs that \u201cprioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity,\u201d \u201cideological neutrality\u201d is defined as LLMs that are \u201cneutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.\u201d\nThose definitions leave room for broad interpretation, as well as potential pressure. AI companies have pushed for fewer constraints on how they operate. And while an executive order doesn\u2019t carry the force of legislation, frontier AI firms could still find themselves subject to the shifting priorities of the administration\u2019s political agenda.\nLast week, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI signed contracts with the Department of Defense to receive up to $200 million each to develop agentic AI workflows that address critical national security challenges.\nIt\u2019s unclear which of these companies is best positioned to gain from the woke AI ban, or if they will comply.\nTechCrunch has reached out to each of them and will update this article if we hear back.\nDespite displaying biases of its own, xAI may be the most aligned with the order \u2014 at least at this early stage. Elon Musk has positioned Grok, xAI\u2019s chatbot, as the ultimate anti-woke, \u201cless biased,\u201d truthseeker. Grok\u2019s system prompts have directed it to avoid deferring to mainstream authorities and media, to seek contrarian information even if it\u2019s politically incorrect, and to even reference Musk\u2019s own views on controversial topics. In recent months, Grok has even spouted antisemitic comments and praised Hitler on X, among other hateful, racist, and misogynistic posts.\nMark Lemley, a law professor at Stanford University, told TechCrunch the executive order is \u201cclearly intended as viewpoint discrimination, since [the government] just signed a contract with Grok, aka \u2018MechaHitler.\u2019\u201d\nAlongside xAI\u2019s DOD funding, the company announced that \u201cGrok for Government\u201d had been added to the General Services Administration schedule, meaning that xAI products are now available for purchase across every government office and agency.\n\u201cThe right question is this: would they ban Grok, the AI they just signed a large contract with, because it has been deliberately engineered to give politically charged answers?\u201d Lemley said in an email interview. \u201cIf not, it is clearly designed to discriminate against a particular viewpoint.\u201d\nAs Grok\u2019s own system prompts have shown, model outputs can be a reflection of both the people building the technology and the data the AI is trained on. In some cases, an overabundance of caution among developers and AI trained on internet content that promotes values like inclusivity have led to distorted model outputs. Google, for example, last year came under fire after its Gemini chatbot showed a black George Washington and racially diverse Nazis \u2014 which Trump\u2019s order calls out as an example of DEI-infected AI models.\nChowdhury says her biggest fear with this executive order is that AI companies will actively rework training data to tow the party line. She pointed to statements from Musk a few weeks prior to launching Grok 4, saying that xAI would use the new model and its advanced reasoning capabilities to \u201crewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors. Then retrain on that.\u201d\nThis would ostensibly put Musk into the position of judging what is true, which could have huge downstream implications for how information is accessed.\nOf course, companies have been making judgment calls about what information is seen and not seen since the dawn of the internet.\nConservative David Sacks \u2014 the entrepreneur and investor who Trump appointed as AI czar \u2014 has been outspoken about his concerns around \u201cwoke AI\u201d on the All-In Podcast, which co-hosted Trump\u2019s day of AI announcements. Sacks has accused the creators of prominent AI products of infusing them with left-wing values, framing his arguments as a defense of free speech, and a warning against a trend toward centralized ideological control in digital platforms.\nThe problem, experts say, is that there is no one truth. Achieving unbiased or neutral results is impossible, especially in today\u2019s world where even facts are politicized.\n\u201cIf the results that an AI produces say that climate science is correct, is that left wing bias?\u201d Seargeant said. \u201cSome people say you need to give both sides of the argument to be objective, even if one side of the argument has no status to it.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nSundar Pichai is 'very excited' about Google Cloud's OpenAI partnership\ndescription3:\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai says he is \u201cvery excited\u201d to supply OpenAI, the search giant\u2019s largest competitor in AI, with cloud computing resources to train and serve the company\u2019s AI models as part of a recently struck partnership.\n\u201cWith respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud,\u201d said Pichai on Google\u2019s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. \u201cGoogle Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs, etc. So super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side, and we look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing that.\u201d\nThe comment came shortly after analysts peppered Pichai and other Google executives with questions about how AI would affect its core search business and why Google is spending an extra $10 billion on capital expenditures this year to catch up in the AI race. Roughly two and a half years since the launch of ChatGPT, Google has now shifted its focus squarely on developing leading AI models and products to compete with OpenAI.\nChatGPT is a major threat to Google Search, but the OpenAI deal marks a massive new customer for Google Cloud. It\u2019s a treacherous relationship for Google to navigate; OpenAI may ultimately use Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure and chips to upend the company\u2019s core Search product.\nEarlier this month, OpenAI quietly added Google Cloud to a public list of suppliers that it uses for cloud computing services, alongside Microsoft and Oracle. Reuters previously reported in June that OpenAI was considering tapping Google Cloud for extra computational power.\nNotably, Google Cloud revenue soared in the second quarter of 2025 to $13.6 billion, up from $10.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Google attributes a significant chunk of that growth to the Google Cloud Platform and other products it offers to AI companies. Google Cloud is still a small business relative to Google Search, but it seems to be growing in the AI era.\nSeveral large AI labs have tapped Google Cloud as a cloud computing partner, including Anthropic, Ilya Sutskever\u2019s Safe Superintelligence, Fei-Fei Li\u2019s World Labs, and now OpenAI. Pichai noted on the earnings call that the company has been successful at winning deals with large AI labs thanks to its large supply of Nvidia GPU chips and in-house TPU chips.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nGoogle Cloud seems like a smart partner for OpenAI. The startup is extremely constrained when it comes to Nvidia GPUs, which it uses to train new AI models and serve them to hundreds of millions of users. Those constraints have been a major tension point with OpenAI\u2019s biggest backer and largest cloud computing partner, Microsoft, forcing the ChatGPT maker to turn to its competitors in the cloud market.\nOn the AI products front, Google seems to be doing better than initially expected. The company said its AI chatbot, Gemini, now reaches 450 million monthly active users, and AI Overviews reaches 2 billion monthly active users. However, the business around these products remains unclear, as does the share of queries they\u2019re taking from Google Search.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that Pichai is truly that excited about working with OpenAI, a company that represents the biggest threat Google Search has ever faced. The partnership is reminiscent of Google\u2019s deal with Yahoo from decades ago, when it was just a startup, and used Yahoo\u2019s homepage as an accelerant to overtake it as the front door to the internet. How lasting OpenAI\u2019s relationship with Google is remains to be seen.\n\ntitle4:\nTesla profits pulled down by falling EV sales and regulatory credits\ndescription4:\nFalling EV sales combined with a lower average selling price, less cash from regulatory credits, and a decline in solar and energy storage revenue took a toll on Tesla\u2019s bottom line in the second quarter of 2025. And a 17% growth in revenue in its services business, which includes capital generated from its Supercharging network, wasn\u2019t enough to close the gap.\nThe company reported Wednesday revenue of $22.5 billion, a 12% decline from the same period last year. The company\u2019s Q2 revenue results did show an improvement over the first quarter when it generated $19.3 billion in revenue and did manage to just barely beat analysts expectations. (Analysts polled by Yahoo finance expected revenue in the second quarter to reach $22.13 billion.)\nHowever, net income, and more specifically operating income, is where the year-over-year gap grows larger.\nTesla reported net income of $1.17 billion in the second quarter, a 16% drop from the $1.4 billion in net income in the same period last year. Tesla reported $409 million in net income in Q1 2025 in the first quarter of the year.\nMeanwhile, Tesla\u2019s operating income fell 42% year-over-year to $923 million.\nWhile Tesla noted pressure from an \u201cuncertain macroeconomic environment resulting from shifting tariffs\u201d and \u201cunclear impacts from changes to fiscal policy and political sentiment,\u201d the company tried to position the results as a turning point in its focus, and future.\n\u201cQ2 2025 was a seminal point in Tesla\u2019s history: the beginning of our transition from leading the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries to also becoming a leader in AI, robotics and related services,\u201d the company said in its shareholder letter.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe future Tesla is betting on has yet to deliver the kind of revenue its automotive sector has. Or any revenue, at all. Today, Tesla\u2019s push into robotics, AI, and robotaxis is an expense, not a profit driver.\nTesla\u2019s earnings are largely a reflection of falling EV sales \u2014 although fewer regulatory credits also played a role. The company brought in $439 million in regulatory credits in the second quarter, a 50% drop since the same period last year.\nRegulatory credits have provided a consistent stream of revenue, and in some cases, have helped push the company\u2019s bottom line into the black. For instance, Tesla\u2019s income in the first quarter was boosted by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits. Without those, it would have posted a loss.\nAnd the days of regulatory credits are quickly coming to an end. The 2025 Budget Reconciliation Act that was signed into law July 4 essentially devalues the marketplace, in which automakers facing penalties under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards would buy zero-emissions credits from manufacturers building and selling EVs. The budget bill changed the penalties for violating CAFE standards to $0.\nEarlier this month, Tesla said it delivered 384,122 vehicles in the second quarter of this year, a 13.5% drop from the same period in 2024. Second-quarter sales were an improvement over the first quarter, however, when the company delivered 337,000 vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Tesla is facing regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales.\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles is arguing in a hearing that kicked off Monday that Tesla should lose its license to sell vehicles in the state over false advertising claims on its branded Autopilot and Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance systems.\nMeanwhile, a civil lawsuit is playing out in a Florida courtroom over a fatal 2019 crash in which a Tesla driver using Autopilot plowed through an intersection and struck two people.
