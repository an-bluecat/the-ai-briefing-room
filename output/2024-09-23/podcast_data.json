Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Pffft. Who needs that when you can be the father of creation, ushering in a new age of humanity?\nWelcome to \u201cgod mode.\u201d\nSam Altman, the CEO of the AI startup headed for a $150 billion valuation, OpenAI, has historically pitched AI as the solution to the world\u2019s problems, despite its significant impact on energy resources, carbon emissions, and water usage to cool data centers, coming at the cost of the progress the world has made toward combating climate change.\nIn Altman\u2019s latest post, the OpenAI leader presents an incredibly positive update on the state of AI, hyping its world-changing potential. Far from being an occasionally helpful alternative to a Google search or a homework helper, AI, as Altman presents, will change humanity\u2019s progress \u2014 for the better, naturally.\nThrough rose-tinted contacts, Altman pitches the numerous ways he believes AI will save the world. But much of what he writes is seemingly meant to convince the skeptics of how much AI matters and could well have the opposite result: Instead of creating new fans, posts like this may well invite increased scrutiny as to whether we\u2019re in an \u201cemperor\u2019s new clothes\u201d situation.\nAs one commentator with the username sharkjacobs on the technical forum Hacker News writes, \u201cI\u2019m not an AI skeptic at all, I use LLMs all the time, and find them very useful. But stuff like this makes me very skeptical of the people who are making and selling AI.\u201d\nLet\u2019s go through Altman\u2019s promises and rate them as believable or just hype:\nAI will help us solve \u201c hard problems.\u201d Believable. Whether those hard problems will be in something profound, like medical science, or something beyond helping engineers with coding challenges, or helping kids cheat on their homework, or the creation of weird and maybe partially stolen art, still remains to be seen.\nBelievable. Whether those hard problems will be in something profound, like medical science, or something beyond helping engineers with coding challenges, or helping kids cheat on their homework, or the creation of weird and maybe partially stolen art, still remains to be seen. \u201c We\u2019ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI.\u201d Veering into hype. Yes, using a new tool or technology will help us accomplish more, but will it actually increase efficiency to the point that businesses are willing to shell out for it, especially considering the state it\u2019s in today? It\u2019s still too early to know the answer here.\nVeering into hype.

First of all, creating \u201calmost anything\u201d we can imagine is not necessarily a good thing \u2014 not only because it detracts from the art and works created by humans but also because people can imagine some genuinely terrible things.

It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!); it may take longer, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Hype with a capital H. A vague tease that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is, with all certainty, going to arrive, and it\u2019s only a matter of time. However, many AI critics argue AGI may not be realized, at least as promised.

But don\u2019t sugarcoat this one \u2014 this coming change could be bad in the immediate future. \u201cMany of the jobs we do today would have looked like trifling wastes of time to people a few hundred years ago, but nobody is looking back at the past, wishing they were a lamplighter.\u201d Hype. Why shade lamplighters? That actually sounds like a pretty chill job? Jokes aside, this falsely equates the arrival of AI as being as impactful as the arrival of electricity, which is more than a little presumptuous.\nAltman\u2019s hype aside, it\u2019s worth acknowledging that AI is a sizable platform shift and perhaps the biggest since the arrival of mobile technology. (Case in point: Apple is selling its iPhone 16 based on its AI capabilities, not its hardware.)\nAI could eventually deliver major changes in time. But today, it\u2019s still fair to question if the arrival of AI will ultimately prove as significant as connecting the world through the internet, putting a web-connected computer in everyone\u2019s home, and then in everyone\u2019s pocket.\nOn the one side are the true believers counting the days to AGI, and on the other, skeptics who would like to see more before dubbing the AI age a utopia \u2014 especially considering the real-world costs to the environment, the workforce, art, and creation.\nWe\u2019re currently at the point in AI\u2019s development where consumers and businesses alike are figuring out how AI will fit into their usual workflows, where AI can improve efficiencies, and where it will not. Until then, much of what\u2019s being written about AI\u2019s future can only be speculative.\n\ntitle1:\nHere is what's illegal under California's 9 (and counting) new AI laws\ndescription1:\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom is currently considering 38 AI-related bills, including the highly contentious SB 1047, which the state\u2019s legislature sent to his desk for final approval. These bills try to address the most pressing issues in artificial intelligence: everything from futuristic AI systems creating existential risk, deepfake nudes from AI image generators, to Hollywood studios creating AI clones of dead performers.\n\u201cHome to the majority of the world\u2019s leading AI companies, California is working to harness these transformative technologies to help address pressing challenges while studying the risks they present,\u201d said Governor Newsom\u2019s office in a press release.\nSo far, Governor Newsom has signed nine of them into law, some of which are America\u2019s most far reaching AI laws yet.\nAI robocalls\nOn Friday, Governor Newsom signed a bill into law requiring robocalls to disclose whether they\u2019ve use AI-generated voices. AB 2905 aims to prevent another instance of the deepfake robocall resembling Joe Biden\u2019s voice that confused many New Hampshire voters earlier this year.\nDeepfake nudes\nNewsom signed two laws that address the creation and spread of deepfake nudes on Thursday. SB 926 criminalizes the act, making it illegal to blackmail someone with AI-generated nude images that resemble them.\nSB 981, which also became law on Thursday, requires social media platforms to establish channels for users to report deepfake nudes that resemble them. The content must then be temporarily blocked while the platform investigates it, and permanently removed if confirmed.\nWatermarks\nAlso on Thursday, Newsom signed a bill into law to help the public identify AI-generated content. SB 942 requires widely used generative AI systems to disclose they are AI-generated in their content\u2019s provenance data. For example, all images created by OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E now need a little tag in their metadata saying they\u2019re AI generated.\nMany AI companies already do this, and there are several free tools out there that can help people read this provenance data and detect AI-generated content.\nElection deepfakes\nEarlier this week, California\u2019s governor signed three laws cracking down on AI deepfakes that could influence elections.\nOne of California\u2019s new laws, AB 2655, requires large online platforms, like Facebook and X, to remove or label AI deepfakes related to elections, as well as create channels to report such content. Candidates and elected officials can seek injunctive relief if a large online platform is not complying with the act.\nAnother law, AB 2839, takes aim at social media users who post, or repost, AI deepfakes that could deceive voters about upcoming elections. The law went into effect immediately on Tuesday, and Newsom suggested Elon Musk may be at risk of violating it.\nAI-generated political advertisements now require outright disclosures under California\u2019s new law, AB 2355. That means moving forward, Trump may not be able to get away with posting AI deepfakes of Taylor Swift endorsing him on Truth Social (she endorsed Kamala Harris). The FCC has proposed a similar disclosure requirement at a national level and has already made robocalls using AI-generated voices illegal.\nActors and AI\nTwo laws that Newsom signed on Tuesday \u2014 which SAG-AFTRA, the nation\u2019s largest film and broadcast actors union, was pushing for \u2014 create new standards for California\u2019s media industry. AB 2602 requires studios to obtain permission from an actor before creating an AI-generated replica of their voice or likeness.\nMeanwhile, AB 1836 prohibits studios from creating digital replicas of deceased performers without consent from their estates (e.g., legally cleared replicas were used in the recent \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, as well as in other films).\nWhat\u2019s left?\nGovernor Newsom still has 29 AI-related bills to decide on before the end of September. During a chat with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on Tuesday during the 2024 Dreamforce conference, Newsom may have tipped his hat about SB 1047, and how he\u2019s thinking about regulating the AI industry more broadly.\n\u201cThere\u2019s one bill that is sort of outsized in terms of public discourse and consciousness; it\u2019s this SB 1047,\u201d said Newsom onstage Tuesday. \u201cWhat are the demonstrable risks in AI and what are the hypothetical risks? I can\u2019t solve for everything. What can we solve for? And so that\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking across the spectrum on this.\u201d\nCheck back on this article for updates on what AI laws California\u2019s governor signs, and what he doesn\u2019t.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla Superchargers: GM, Ford, Rivian, and other EV brands with access\ndescription2:\nEighteen months ago, Ford triggered a transformation when the U.S. automaker locked in a deal to give owners of its EVs access to the Tesla Supercharger network.\nIn a stunning shift, automaker after automaker \u2014 from GM and Hyundai to Rivian and Mercedes \u2014 followed suit. By the end of 2023, nearly every major automaker had agreed to adopt Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and promised EV owners that adapters would soon be on their way.\nMost non-Tesla customers are still waiting. However, GM\u2019s announcement earlier this week may provide an electric lining of optimism.\nEV owners of GM vehicles like the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Cadillac Lyriq will now officially have access to Tesla\u2019s Superchargers. All GM EV owners need to do is purchase, and wait for, the GM-approved adapters that will allow their cars to charge on Tesla\u2019s ports.\nMore may soon follow. TechCrunch is tracking which brands have access to the Tesla Supercharging Network and will be updating this list.\nThe shift to the Tesla EV charging standard\nIn November 2022, Tesla shared its EV charging connector design in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology and help make it the new standard in North America. At the time, every other automaker was using the Combined Charging Standard (CCS) in North America.\nMass adoption seemed unlikely at the time even though Tesla\u2019s charging network was considered far superior thanks to its robust and user-friendly design and the ease of paying for the EV juice.\nSix months later, Ford became the first to announce it would work with Tesla in a deal that would give its customers access to more than 12,000 Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. But it wasn\u2019t just about giving Ford EV owners access to a special adapter. Ford also committed to integrating its future EVs with NACS ports instead of CCS.\nRivian, GM, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Volkwagen, Porsche, Audi, Hyundai, Kia, Lucid, and Stellantis followed.\nTesla charging FAQs\nIn the U.S. today, there are 36,499 NACS ports available publicly (although some of those might be from other EV charging companies that have adapted Tesla\u2019s standard), compared to around 16,925 CCS ports. That\u2019s despite federal dollars that have gone explicitly to the buildout of CCS chargers.\nFor EV owners stuck with a CCS port, they\u2019ll have to hold out for manufacturer-approved adapters. While there are some third-party adapters that claim to be compliant with certain safety and performance standards, like Lectron\u2019s Vortex Plug for $199, Tesla\u2019s website says such adapters are prohibited.\nA GM spokesperson told TechCrunch its adapters have been specifically designed to protect GM EV batteries while charging and that its vehicle warranty doesn\u2019t cover damage to vehicle parts resulting from the use of non-GM approved adapters.\nIn late August, Tesla posted on X that it had ramped up production of adapters. That statement, combined with GM\u2019s announcement, could mean that even more non-Tesla EVs will be pulling up to Supercharger stations soon. They\u2019ll all have to download the Tesla app so they can pay for charging.\nTesla supercharging access checklist\nGeneral Motors\nAs of September 2024, GM has finally updated the software on its Chevy, Cadillac, and GMC EVs so customers can use Tesla\u2019s Superchargers. If they want access soon, they need to purchase a \u201cGM approved\u201d adapter through their app for $225.\nGM wouldn\u2019t say how long shipping would take. A GM spokesperson said the company already has an inventory of the adapters and that it\u2019s worked with multiple suppliers to manufacture the approved NACS DC fast-charging adapters.\nFrom 2025 onward, GM\u2019s EVs will be built with the NACS charge port.\nFord\nCertain Ford customers officially gained access to Tesla Superchargers in February, but ongoing supply constraints have delayed the delivery of free fast-charging adapters for most customers (although Ford says the delays have affected \u201csome\u201d customers).\nCurrent owners of the Mustang Mach-E and Ford F-150 Lightning who have yet to order their adapter can do so through their Ford Pass app. The deadline to apply for a free adapter is September 30.\nRivian\nEV startup Rivian officially got access to 15,000 Superchargers across North America on March 18, 2024. At the time, Rivian promised to begin sending adapters to customers starting in April. A Rivian spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker began delivery this spring and continues to ship adapters as quickly as it receives them.\nTechCrunch will update the list as automakers gain official access.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta Connect 2024: How to watch the metaverse and generative AI event\ndescription3:\nMeta Connect 2024 kicks off on Wednesday at 10 a.m. PT, with a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The developer event is set to focus on Meta\u2019s XR (VR and AR) platforms, the metaverse, and the Facebook parent\u2019s open source generative AI platform, Llama. Some new hardware, including the Meta Quest 4, updates to the Meta Ray-Bans, and a glimpse at the new \u201cOrion\u201d AR headset could maybe get some time in the California sunshine.\nThere are a few ways to stream the presentation live. The simplest way is by bookmarking the Meta Connect site, where you can register for free. Meta will also stream it through its developer Facebook page. If you really want to feel like like you\u2019re in Menlo Park from the comfort of your own living room, you can also access the keynote through Horizon Worlds via your Meta Quest headset.\nAs with last year\u2019s event, Meta will be streaming via YouTube. We\u2019ll add that link to this post once it\u2019s live. Further developer panels will also be made available through YouTube and Facebook, as the event runs through Thursday. You can find the full schedule for Meta Connect 2024 at this link.\nAs ever, TechCrunch will be bringing you the news as it breaks.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle TV receives a major update ahead of the launch of its new streaming box\ndescription4:\nAhead of the launch of Google TV Streamer, the company\u2019s new set-top streaming box, the tech giant is also bringing updates to all Google TV devices. This includes a home panel that can control smart home devices, AI-powered screensavers, a new sports page, and more.\nThe company announced on Monday a host of new features to enhance its Google TV platform, starting with a new home panel that acts as a control center for compatible smart home gadgets, such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. Users can also access new doorbell notifications to see who\u2019s at the front door without pausing what they\u2019re watching. Additionally, if the remote is nowhere to be found, Google Assistant voice commands allow users to control their devices hands-free.\nThe home panel is located in Quick Settings and opens as a feed on the right side of the screen.\nThe new sports page in the For You tab is where fans can go to get all the sports content in one place, including live and upcoming games, sports commentary, YouTube highlights, as well as personalized recommendations tailored to their interests.\nImage Credits: Google TV\nGoogle TV is also gaining several AI capabilities, including the ability to generate custom screensaver artwork based on a provided prompt. Initially introduced for the Google TV Streamer, Google is using Gemini to power its \u201cOverviews\u201d feature for listings, providing concise summaries of top shows and movies, season-by-season breakdowns, and audience reviews.\nGoogle Freeplay, the dedicated app with 150 free channels to choose from, is getting an update too. Its revamped channel guide allows viewers to quickly browse by genre and topic.\nGoogle TV is also expanding to include more Art TVs, including Hisense and TCL, as well as projectors like Epson, Vankyo, and XGIMI. Plus, it\u2019s launching in more countries: Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nThese updates coincide with tomorrow\u2019s release of the Google TV Streamer, which will mark the end of Google\u2019s lineup of Chromecast devices. Google touts over 270 million monthly active Google TV and Android TV devices.\"\n\nResponse:",
