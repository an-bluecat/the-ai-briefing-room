Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday April 17), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI is reportedly in talks to buy Windsurf for $3B, with news expected later this week\ndescription0:\nWindsurf, the maker of a popular AI coding assistant, is in talks to be acquired by OpenAI for about $3 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nIf the deal happens, it would put OpenAI in direct competition with a number of other AI coding assistant providers, including Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, which OpenAI backed from its OpenAI Startup Fund.\nThe acquisition could jeopardize the credibility of the OpenAI Startup Fund, given that it is one of Cursor\u2019s biggest investors, said a person familiar with Cursor\u2019s cap table. It\u2019s not clear whether OpenAI approached Cursor about an acquisition.\nIn addition to what sources told Bloomberg, there are a few more clues that something is going on between the two companies. A couple of days ago, Windsurf users received an email that said that because of an announcement later this week, they have the option to lock in access to the coding editor at $10 a month.\nScreenshot\nAnd OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also released a video yesterday praising Windsurf\u2019s capabilities.\nWindsurf, the company formerly known as Codeium, has been in talks to raise fresh funds at a $2.85 billion valuation led by Kleiner Perkins, TechCrunch reported in February. The company has reached about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), according to our reporting. That revenue run rate is much lower than Cursor\u2019s, which reportedly makes $200 million on an ARR basis. Cursor has been in talks to raise capital at about $10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.\nSince its founding in 2021 by Varun Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen, Windsuf has raised $243 million from investors including Greenoaks Capital and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.\nAdditional reporting by Sarah Perez\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft researchers say they've developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft researchers claim they\u2019ve developed the largest-scale 1-bit AI model, also known as a \u201cbitnet,\u201d to date. Called BitNet b1.58 2B4T, it\u2019s openly available under an MIT license and can run on CPUs, including Apple\u2019s M2.\nBitnets are essentially compressed models designed to run on lightweight hardware. In standard models, weights, the values that define the internal structure of a model, are often quantized so the models perform well on a wide range of machines. Quantizing the weights lowers the number of bits \u2014 the smallest units a computer can process \u2014 needed to represent those weights, enabling models to run on chips with less memory, faster.\nBitnets quantize weights into just three values: -1, 0, and 1. In theory, that makes them far more memory- and computing-efficient than most models today.\nThe Microsoft researchers say that BitNet b1.58 2B4T is the first bitnet with 2 billion parameters, \u201cparameters\u201d being largely synonymous with \u201cweights.\u201d Trained on a dataset of 4 trillion tokens \u2014 equivalent to about 33 million books, by one estimate \u2014 BitNet b1.58 2B4T outperforms traditional models of similar sizes, the researchers claim.\nBitNet b1.58 2B4T doesn\u2019t sweep the floor with rival 2 billion-parameter models, to be clear, but it seemingly holds its own. According to the researchers\u2019 testing, the model surpasses Meta\u2019s Llama 3.2 1B, Google\u2019s Gemma 3 1B, and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen 2.5 1.5B on benchmarks including GSM8K (a collection of grade-school-level math problems) and PIQA (which tests physical commonsense reasoning skills).\nPerhaps more impressively, BitNet b1.58 2B4T is speedier than other models of its size \u2014 in some cases, twice the speed \u2014 while using a fraction of the memory.\nThere is a catch, however.\nAchieving that performance requires using Microsoft\u2019s custom framework, bitnet.cpp, which only works with certain hardware at the moment. Absent from the list of supported chips are GPUs, which dominate the AI infrastructure landscape.\nThat\u2019s all to say that bitnets may hold promise, particularly for resource-constrained devices. But compatibility is \u2014 and will likely remain \u2014 a big sticking point.\n\ntitle2:\nxAI adds a 'memory' feature to Grok\ndescription2:\nElon Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI, is slowly bringing its Grok chatbot to parity with top rivals like ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.\nWednesday night, xAI announced a \u201cmemory\u201d feature for Grok that enables the bot to remember details from past conversations. Now, if you ask Grok for recommendations, it\u2019ll give more personalized responses \u2014 assuming you\u2019ve used it enough to allow it to \u201clearn\u201d your preferences.\nChatGPT has long had a similar memory feature, which was recently upgraded to reference a user\u2019s entire chat history. Gemini, too, has persistent memory to tailor its replies to individual people.\n\u201cMemories are transparent,\u201d reads a post from the official Grok account on X. \u201c[Y]ou can see exactly what Grok knows and choose what to forget.\u201d\nGrok now remembers your conversations. When you ask for recommendations or advice, you\u2019ll get personalized responses. pic.twitter.com/UXhX7BjS57 \u2014 Grok (@grok) April 17, 2025\nGrok\u2019s new memory feature is available in beta on Grok.com and the Grok iOS and Android apps \u2014 but not for users in the EU or U.K. It can be toggled off from the Data Controls page in the settings menu, and individual \u201cmemories\u201d can be deleted by tapping the icon beneath the memory from the Grok chat interface on the web (and soon Android).\nxAI says that it\u2019s working on bringing the memory feature to the Grok experience on X.\n\ntitle3:\nZoom restores service after an hours-long outage\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nZoom says its platform is back online after suffering an outage for much of Wednesday afternoon.\n\u201cService has now been restored after the earlier outage, and we sincerely appreciate your patience and understanding,\u201d Zoom said in a post on X at around 2 p.m. Pacific.\nThe trouble began around 11:40 a.m., according to The Verge, citing data from Cisco\u2019s ThousandEyes platform. Users on social media reported having trouble logging in and getting an \u201cUnable to Connect\u201d error message when entering meetings. Zoom\u2019s site also went down \u2014 as did its inbox for media inquiries.\nMore than 59,000 users had reported issues on the outage-tracking site DownDetector.com by noon.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear what the cause was. The Verge speculates that it might\u2019ve been DNS-related, pointing to a Reddit thread. When reached for comment, a Zoom spokesperson referred TechCrunch to the above X post.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI's latest AI models have a new safeguard to prevent biorisks\ndescription4:\nOpenAI says that it deployed a new system to monitor its latest AI reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, for prompts related to biological and chemical threats. The system aims to prevent the models from offering advice that could instruct someone on carrying out potentially harmful attacks, according to OpenAI\u2019s safety report.\nO3 and o4-mini represent a meaningful capability increase over OpenAI\u2019s previous models, the company says, and thus pose new risks in the hands of bad actors. According to OpenAI\u2019s internal benchmarks, o3 is more skilled at answering questions around creating certain types of biological threats in particular. For this reason \u2014 and to mitigate other risks \u2014 OpenAI created the new monitoring system, which the company describes as a \u201csafety-focused reasoning monitor.\u201d\nThe monitor, custom-trained to reason about OpenAI\u2019s content policies, runs on top of o3 and o4-mini. It\u2019s designed to identify prompts related to biological and chemical risk and instruct the models to refuse to offer advice on those topics.\nTo establish a baseline, OpenAI had red teamers spend around 1,000 hours flagging \u201cunsafe\u201d biorisk-related conversations from o3 and o4-mini. During a test in which OpenAI simulated the \u201cblocking logic\u201d of its safety monitor, the models declined to respond to risky prompts 98.7% of the time, according to OpenAI.\nOpenAI acknowledges that its test didn\u2019t account for people who might try new prompts after getting blocked by the monitor, which is why the company says it\u2019ll continue to rely in part on human monitoring.\nO3 and o4-mini don\u2019t cross OpenAI\u2019s \u201chigh risk\u201d threshold for biorisks, according to the company. However, compared to o1 and GPT-4, OpenAI says that early versions of o3 and o4-mini proved more helpful at answering questions around developing biological weapons.\nChart from o3 and o4-mini\u2019s system card (Screenshot: OpenAI)\nThe company is actively tracking how its models could make it easier for malicious users to develop chemical and biological threats, according to OpenAI\u2019s recently updated Preparedness Framework.\nOpenAI is increasingly relying on automated systems to mitigate the risks from its models. For example, to prevent GPT-4o\u2019s native image generator from creating child sexual abuse material (CSAM), OpenAI says it uses a reasoning monitor similar to the one the company deployed for o3 and o4-mini.\nYet several researchers have raised concerns OpenAI isn\u2019t prioritizing safety as much as it should. One of the company\u2019s red-teaming partners, Metr, said it had relatively little time to test o3 on a benchmark for deceptive behavior. Meanwhile, OpenAI decided not to release a safety report for its GPT-4.1 model, which launched earlier this week.\"\n\nResponse:",
