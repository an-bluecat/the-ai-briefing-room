Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday October 1), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\n11x.ai, a developer of AI sales reps, has raised $50M Series B led by A16Z, sources say\ndescription0:\n11x.ai, a startup that develops AI-powered sales development bots, has secured roughly $50 million in Series B funding, TechCrunch has learned. The new round was led by Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at around $350 million, multiple sources told TechCrunch.\nThe recent deal follows the company\u2019s $24 million Series A, which was led by Benchmark with the participation of other investors including 20VC, Project A, Lux Capital, and SV Angel. While 11x.ai announced its Series A round earlier this month, we\u2019ve learned that the deal closed earlier in 2024. The company was valued at $90 million during its Series A, according to one source.\n11x.ai and Andreessen Horowitz didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nHasan Sukkar, 11x\u2019s founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that the company is approaching $10 million in annual recurring revenue. This implies that investors valued the startup at about 35 times ARR, a multiple that\u2019s a notch more grounded than heady valuations recently garnered by other AI-powered companies with similar revenues. For example, Hebbia, a large document search startup, has raised a Series B at 54 times ARR, TechCrunch reported in July.\nWhile Series B places 11x.ai ahead of competitors in terms of valuation and total capital, investors told TechCrunch that it\u2019s still too early to tell whether the company has established a significant lead over its rivals. 11x.ai is one of many quickly growing startups building AI sales development representatives, or AI SDRs. Other startups working on similar solutions include Reggie.ai, AiSDR and Artisan. Incumbents such as Salesforce have also introduced products that work as autonomous sales agents.\nAlthough some investors are wary of backing AI SDR startups because it is hard to distinguish these companies\u2019 offerings from each other, 11x\u2019s Series B shows that other VCs are not afraid to make a larger bet on one of these startups.\n11x.ai currently has two AI bots, or what the company is calling \u201cautomated digital workers.\u201d Alice is an AI SDR that handles sales lead generation, research and customer outreach. The company recently introduced Jordan, an AI phone sales representative that speaks over 30 languages and can handle inbound and outbound conversations with prospective human buyers.\nThe company told TechCrunch last year that they\u2019re developing AI bots for talent acquisition and human resources. Now that 11x.ai has more capital, it may focus on expanding its suite of digital employees beyond just sales representatives.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle to invest $1 billion in Thailand data center and AI push\ndescription1:\nAn illuminated Google logo is seen inside an office building in Zurich, Switzerland.\nGoogle announced Monday it is investing 36 billion Thai baht, or $1 billion, into Thailand for the creation of a new data center and expansion of the country's cloud infrastructure.\nThe move marks a ramp-up of Google's expansion in Asia, putting artificial intelligence at the heart of its international push at a time when it is facing intense competition from companies such as Microsoft and OpenAI.\nThe investment would see the company create its first data center in Thailand, Google said in a post on its Thailand blog Monday.\nData centers are the backbone of today's modern digital economy, fueling the rise of cloud computing technology that enables access to storage, compute and analytics services via the internet.\nGoogle said its debut Thai data center will be located in Chonburi, an eastern province of Thailand.\nThe facility will \"help support the growing demand for Google Cloud and AI innovations, as well as popular Google services such as Google Search, Google Maps and Google Workspace\" in Thailand, Jackie Wang, Google's Thailand country lead, said in the blog post, according to an English translation taken via Google Translate.\nBeyond developing infrastructure, the $1 billion investment from Google into Thailand is \"also about unlocking new opportunities for businesses, educators and all Thais,\" Wang said in the blog post.\n\"As AI transforms industries, it is more important than ever to educate and upskill Thais to use this technology,\" she added.\nThailand's digital economy is the second-largest in Southeast Asia and is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025, Google, Temasek and Bain & Company said in a 2023 report by e-Conomy SEA.\nGoogle is investing in the region with a focus on AI as it faces pressure from its rival tech giants when it comes to both AI and cloud computing.\nThe internet giant currently dominates globally when it comes to its search engine technology. But the firm has increasingly come under threat from the surge of generative AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nIt is a technology that Google helped pioneer through its early research on so-called transformer models, which are the bedrock of many of the most-popular generative AI models.\nHowever, today Google finds itself under threat from the use of generative AI products, such as ChatGPT and Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, to find information about things.\nLast week, Google filed an antitrust lawsuit with the European Commission accusing Microsoft of abusing its dominant position in the cloud industry to undermine competition.\n\ntitle2:\nCerebras files for IPO\ndescription2:\nAndrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, speaks at the Collision conference in Toronto on June 20, 2024.\nArtificial intelligence chip startup Cerebras Systems on Monday filed its prospectus for an initial public offering, with plans to trade under the ticker symbol \"CBRS\" on the Nasdaq.\nCerebras competes with Nvidia , whose graphics processing units are the industry's choice for training and running AI models. Cerebras says on its website that its WSE-3 chip comes with more cores and memory than Nvidia's popular H100. It's also a physically larger chip. In addition to selling chips, Cerebras offers cloud-based services that rely on its own computing clusters.\nCerebras had a net loss of $66.6 million in the first six months of 2024 on $136.4 million in sales, according to the filing. For the fist six months of 2023, the company had a net loss of $77.8 million and $8.7 million in sales.\nFor the full year of 2023, Cerebras reported a net loss of $127.2 million on revenue of $78.7 million.\nThe company reported a net loss of $50.9 million on $69.8 million in revenue in the second quarter, compared with a $26.2 million loss and $5.7 million in revenue in the same period a year earlier.\nOperating expenses have increased this year in part because of higher personnel costs to support revenue growth, the company said.\nAI chips are a growing and crowded market. Cloud providers Amazon , Google and Microsoft have developed their own AI chips. The company said that Group 42, a UAE-based AI firm that counts Microsoft as an investor, accounted for 83% of Cerebras's revenue last year.\n\ntitle4:\nY Combinator is being criticized after it backed an AI startup that admits it basically cloned another AI startup\ndescription4:\nA Y Combinator startup named PearAI launched with an X post thread and YouTube video on Saturday and created immediate controversy. And some of that is splashing onto YC itself.\nPearAI offers an AI coding editor. The startup\u2019s founder Duke Pan has openly said that it\u2019s a cloned copy of another AI editor called Continue, which was covered under the Apache open source license. But PearAI made a major misstep: PearAI originally slapped its own made-up closed license on it, called the Pear Enterprise License, which Pan admitted was written by ChatGPT.\nChanging a license like this is a big deal in the open source world. Not only are there legalities involved in violating a software license, but it defeats the whole purpose of open source, which is about community building, sharing, and contributing. In an apology PearAI\u2019s Pan posted on Monday, he said that the project has now been released under the same Apache open source license as the original project.\nThe launch thread went viral with thousands of comments by Sunday. Some were congratulatory, but others were vicious in pointing out the licensing and the fact that PearAI wasn\u2019t so much a fork with new stuff added, but a replica with a new name. Pan admitted as much in his apology.\nSo many angry comments were made on Pan\u2019s launch thread that X put a community note on it that read: \u201cPear is a fork of Continue.dev, an open-source AI code editor. PearAI used Continue.dev\u2019s code and mass-replaced all references to \u2018Continue\u2019 to \u2018PearAI\u2019 to mislead people into believing that they built this product on their own.\u201d\nThis note wasn\u2019t accurate, either. PearAI did say in some of its materials that the project was a clone (also known as a fork) of Continue as well as the original project that Continued used, VSCode. X subsequently removed that note.\nPan apologized for how hard it was to find that information, too. He said that one way he and his cofounder, Nang Ang, \u201cscrewed up, critically, was not being clear enough about this \u2026 doing so upon a fork of others\u2019 work without many new features, and talking about it so publicly online, made it look like we were stealing the work of others as our own.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Continue jumped in with by posting a subtle threat that it was \u201cecstatic to see the ecosystem that has formed around us. But open source can\u2019t be taken for granted\u2014it is a movement built on trust, and on respect for contributions, licenses, and intellectual property.\u201d\nY Combinator CEO Garry Tan got involved, too. He defended PearAI with several tweets. \u201cDon\u2019t understand why people are dragging a new project when literally it\u2019s open source Apache license and that\u2019s *the reason* why open source is awesome\u201d one read. As you might imagine, people pointed out that it was changed to an Apache license after the uproar.\nThere were other reasons this project caught ire. Pan boasted how he \u201cjust quit my 270 000$ job at Coinbase\u201d to do this startup, even though this was about as far from an original idea as a startup can get. In addition to Continue, another big competitor is Cursor.\nOn top of that, YC has funded two other AI code editors already, Void and Melty, as the mob was quick to point out. To which Tan replied on X, \u201cMore choice is good, people building is good, if you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t use it.\u201d\nOthers criticized YC for selecting PearAI into its cohort at all. Blogger Sven Schnieders wrote that PearAI is an example of the \u201cthe decline of YC\u201d because it accepted a company that is \u201cnothing more than a codebase copied from another YC-backed company.\u201d\nOn Hacker News, the site for programmers owned by YC, a commenter wrote that the debacle \u201csays more about YC than this particular founder (lots of these types nowadays): i.e. their process, their due diligence.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cIs it typical for VC to just throw money at projects without any sort of oversight/auditing of, oh jeez, IDK, Licensing/Legal issues?\u201d\nYC\u2019s plans to double from two cohorts a year to four isn\u2019t likely to ease this perception, or this risk.\nThe whole uproar probably says as much about how eager all VCs are to fund AI startups as it does about YC\u2019s love of this particular ilk of them.\nTan could not be immediately reached for comment. PearAI did not have further comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
