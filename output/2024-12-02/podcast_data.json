Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday December 3), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger ousted by board after performance\ndescription0:\nIntel ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger over the weekend, capping a tumultuous nearly four-year tenure at what was America's leading semiconductor company before its stock price and market share collapsed.\nThe company announced Gelsinger's resignation Monday morning, which a person familiar with the matter said came after a contentious board meeting last week over Gelsinger's perceived failure to respond to Nvidia's competitive edge and a lack of confidence in Gelsinger's turnaround plans.\nIntel CFO David Zinsner and Intel products CEO MJ Holthaus were named interim co-CEOs. Longtime board member Frank Yeary will serve as interim executive chair. Shares of Intel were down 2% Monday afternoon.\n\"We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel,\" Yeary said. Yeary was a key driver in Gelsinger's ouster, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential board proceedings freely. Intel did not immediately return a request for comment on the board meeting.\nYeary, Intel's longest-serving board member, will now have to preside over yet another CEO search process. Gelsinger, 63, had an illustrious career at Intel, rising to become the company's first chief technical officer at the turn of the century, before he took a senior role at EMC. Gelsinger returned to the company from VMware, where he was chief executive, to stabilize Intel in 2021, succeeding then-CEO Bob Swan.\n\"It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics,\" Gelsinger said in a press release.\nThe board meeting that led to Gelsinger's ouster was first reported by Bloomberg.\nGelsinger set out an audacious plan when he arrived in 2021 to transform the languishing company into a chipmaking juggernaut. He sought to achieve parity with the two leading chipmakers, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. He pursued big buildouts in the U.S. and around the world, a costly endeavor that weighed heavily on Intel's free cash flow and increased the company's debt load.\nHe also wooed government investment, positioning Intel as the single-largest beneficiary of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. Government money has begun to flow to Intel in recent weeks and will aid the company's chip fabs in Arizona and Ohio. Gelsinger's retirement comes a week after Intel and the CHIPS and Science Act office finalized a $7.86 billion grant.\nGelsinger also moved to position the company as vital to U.S. national security. He won a multibillion-dollar contract with the Department of Defense to build secure chips, and in meetings with analysts and prospective customers stressed that Intel was a trusted partner of the U.S. government.\nBut all that was not enough to assuage investors, who increasingly began to see Intel's aggressive spending as a folly.\n\ntitle1:\nJudge confirms decision to sink Elon Musk's $56B pay package despite Tesla shareholder vote\ndescription1:\nDelaware Chancery court judge Kathaleen McCormick has denied Tesla\u2019s request to revise her decision to strike down CEO Elon Musk\u2019s $56 billion pay package \u2014 despite shareholders voting at the company\u2019s annual meeting this year to \u201cre-ratify\u201d the deal.\nHer decision, laid out in a 103-page opinion piece published on Monday, explains that the attempt by Tesla\u2019s legal team \u2014 which Musk has called \u201chardcore\u201d \u2014 to change her mind contained multiple flaws, each of which were fatal on their own.\n\u201cThe large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\u201d McCormick wrote.\nTesla said it will appeal in a post on X, and has been expected to appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court since McCormick\u2019s initial opinion was issued in January. Since then, though, the company has reincorporated from Delaware to Texas. Musk is also now a sort of right-hand man to President-elect Donald Trump, raising all kinds of questions about his priorities as the United States heads into a new administration.\nMcCormick also awarded the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys a $345 million fee \u2014 payable in cash or Tesla shares \u2014 that is eye-popping but still a fraction of the $5.6 billion those lawyers requested earlier this year.\nTesla awarded the compensation package to Musk in 2018, at a time when the electric automaker was in crisis. It laid out a series of stock price milestones that Tesla would have to hit in order for Musk to unlock the full value of the package \u2014 milestones the company easily cleared in the following years as Tesla ramped up its Model 3 and Model Y programs.\nA former corporate defense lawyer (and thrash metal drummer) Richard Tornetta sued Tesla over the deal. His lawyers argued that shareholders were misinformed because the company and its board of directors were under such great influence from Musk that the negotiations surrounding the package were lopsided. There was a trial, and Judge McCormick explained in her January opinion that she found the core of Tornetta\u2019s argument to be true.\nTesla put the opinion to a vote at its shareholder meeting this June, in an attempt to re-litigate the deal in the court of public opinion.\nThe company released a whole new proxy statement that included McCormick\u2019s January opinion and argued that it would now fully inform the shareholders as they set out to vote a second time. They approved the re-ratification by a margin of more than two to one, and Tesla\u2019s lawyers tried to use this to convince the judge to change tack.\nBut McCormick wrote Monday that Tesla\u2019s legal team has \u201cno procedural ground for flipping the outcome of an adverse post trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\u201d That was one \u201cfatal flaw,\u201d she said. The second is more procedural: Tesla\u2019s legal team considered the vote a \u201ccommon-law\u201d ratification, which is an affirmative defense, and those can\u2019t be raised after a post-trial opinion is released.\nThird, McCormick challenged the common-law ratification idea on its face. While Tesla\u2019s lawyers argued that \u201cstockholders hold the power to adopt any corporate acts they deem in their own best interests,\u201d McCormick said this idea is \u201cdubious generally and unquestionably false in the context of\u201d how Tesla\u2019s governance was essentially captured by Musk.\nFourth, McCormick said that \u201ceven if the Stockholder Vote could have a ratifying effect on the Grant, it could not here due to multiple, material misstatements in the Proxy Statement concerning the effect of the vote.\u201d\n\u201cNovelty is not necessarily damning, but Defendants\u2019 novel request flies in the face of the policy bases for all relevant rules of procedure and the law-of-the-case doctrine\u2014finality, efficiency, consistency, and the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d McCormick wrote.\nThis story has been updated to include Tesla\u2019s confirmation that it will appeal the decision.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon sellers are flocking to TikTok Shop despite looming U.S. ban\ndescription2:\nA file photo of a livestreamer selling handbags at a TikTok Livestreaming E-commerce Base on October 12, 2021 in Wuhan, China. Visual China Group | Getty Images\nSporting a sparkly dress and a Santa hat atop her distinctly pink hair, Sarah Potempa stood in front of her smartphone at her hair-care company's warehouse in Waukegan, Illinois. It was time to go to work. Potempa is a celebrity hairstylist who goes live on TikTok multiple times a week. During \"the packing show,\" as she calls it, Potempa livestreams herself as she packs up orders of her viral Beachwaver curling iron for six to eight hours at a time. The stream on Nov. 20 had a party atmosphere, with Potempa taking breaks to dance to \"In Da Club\" by 50 Cent in between shipping out orders. To the more than 1,000 TikTok users who typically tune in for Potempa's shows, this is entertainment and shopping all at once. Beachwaver is part of a growing influx of retailers that are flocking to TikTok Shop, the video app's shopping service. TikTok Shop launched in September 2023 as a way for users to purchase products without leaving the app, and since then, the China-owned app has emerged as a viable alternative for retailers looking to diversify their e-commerce business from Amazon . Via a dedicated Shop tab, retailers big and small promote products of all kinds, ranging from eyeshadow palettes, phone chargers, detox teas, treadmills and more. On TikTok, retailers typically offer generous coupons and free delivery within a few days. Shoppable posts, which look like normal videos but are ads for products sold in TikTok Shop, frequently appear in TikTok's main video feed, known as the \"For You\" page. Those posts allow users to purchase products without exiting their For You feed. On Potempa's show, shoppers race to place an order to get a 50% discount on Beachwaver products and free add-ons to their order like face washes or lipsticks, along with the chance to have their username read aloud by Potempa while she packs their order on screen. \"When TikTok Shop was new and people hadn't used it yet, they would ask, 'Is this on Amazon yet?'\" Potempa, Beachwaver's CEO and co-founder, said in an interview. \"I would get those questions like, 'Can I buy it somewhere else?' Now that it's been around for a year or so, we've done 1.2 million orders.\" ByteDance-owned TikTok has already cemented itself as an advertising powerhouse, and with TikTok Shop, the company has been trying to carve out another revenue stream through e-commerce. The company has attracted the likes of Nike , PacSun and Crocs , among others. Those retailers want to tap into the more than 170 million Americans on TikTok who shop on impulse as they scroll through videos. They aren't the only ones. Amazon sellers are also being persuaded to try out the service with promises of low fees and steep discounts on products footed by TikTok. Besides sellers, the company has also hired talent away from Amazon, filling key roles for TikTok Shop in areas like marketing, creator relationships, brand safety, category managers and operations. In the 15 months since its launch, TikTok Shop has emerged as a \"massive e-commerce machine,\" according to ecommerceDB, a market research firm. EcommerceDB predicts TikTok Shop will more than double its gross merchandise volume, or the dollar value of items sold on its marketplace, to $50 billion this year. That's a fraction of Amazon's 2024 expected GMV of $757 billion, but nonetheless, TikTok Shop is making strides. \"Every time you scroll, every other scroll is a Shop post, so they're making a lot of investment to encourage that in-app conversion,\" said Caila Schwartz, Salesforce's director of consumer insights and strategy for retail and consumer goods. Amazon spokesperson Mira Dix told CNBC in a statement that sellers are engaging with its store \"more than ever before\" and seeing greater success. Dix said the company's services for sellers are optional, such as fulfillment, which costs \"an average of 70% less\" than comparable two-day shipping alternatives. \"Our selling partners are incredibly important to Amazon, and we work hard to innovate on their behalf and support the growth and success of these businesses across all of their sales channels,\" Dix said.\nBeachwaver CEO Sarah Potempa hosts livestreams on TikTok Shop multiple times a week.\nLooming deadline\nTikTok's e-commerce push comes at a precarious moment for the company. In April, President Joe Biden signed a law that requires ByteDance to sell TikTok by Jan. 19. If TikTok fails to cut ties with its parent company, app stores and internet hosting services would be prohibited from offering the app, amounting to a nationwide ban in the U.S. TikTok has sued to block the measure. President-elect Donald Trump could rescue TikTok from a potential U.S. ban. After trying to implement a TikTok ban during his first administration, Trump reversed his stance, acknowledging in a March interview with CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that \"there's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad\" with the app. Trump changed his position around the time that he met with billionaire Jeff Yass, who is a major investor in ByteDance. As the January deadline grows nearer, TikTok has largely been operating its business as usual. Executives from TikTok Shop pitched its marketplace as a holiday shopping destination during an October event in Manhattan with business owners and social media influencers. Users have shopped hundreds of millions of units on its e-commerce platform since launching September 2023, said Nico Le Bourgeois, TikTok Shop's head of U.S. operations. Le Bourgeois, who joined TikTok in August 2023, previously spent nearly nine years at Amazon in a variety of divisions including its third-party marketplace. TikTok Shop isn't trying to sell \"everything to everybody,\" Le Bourgeois told CNBC in October. TikTok Shop is a marketplace for product discovery that surfaces \"new, cool, interesting\" items from big and small brands, he added. \"You see it, you like it, you buy it. It's not a search,\" he said. \"It's a very different way of shopping.\" Le Bourgeois declined to comment on the looming TikTok ban, but a company spokesperson at the event said TikTok Shop isn't slowing down. \"The sellers here, creators, they're building their livelihoods on TikTok,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're going to continue to show up for that. There's a huge opportunity for us.\"\n'Enjoying it while it's hot'\nMore Americans are expected to turn to TikTok and other China-linked apps for gift buying this holiday shopping season. Roughly 63% of Western consumers plan to purchase from Chinese shopping apps during the season, according to Salesforce. That includes TikTok, Alibaba's AliExpress, Shein, Temu and fast-fashion company Cider. On Saturday, TikTok said its U.S. Black Friday sales topped more than $100 million, with home goods, fashion and beauty products among the most popular categories. Canvas Beauty, a top seller of hair-care and beauty products on TikTok Shop, hit $1 million in sales within two hours of going live on the app, the company said. Retailers and sellers, some of which count TikTok for the lion's share of their online sales, told CNBC that they're sticking with the platform despite the possibility that it could disappear. Although it's impossible to ignore the conversation around a potential TikTok ban in the U.S. as a brand that heavily relies on the platform, Yay's Snacks co-founder and COO Rachel Cheng said she's not convinced that TikTok will go away under the Trump administration because it doesn't seem to be the president-elect's main focus. Yay's Snacks, which makes crispy Cambodian beef jerky, was one of the earliest companies to join TikTok Shop when it launched. Yay's co-founder and CEO Marlin Chan, a former YouTuber, frequently posts humorous TikTok videos promoting his snacks, which are based on his grandmother's original recipe. Among the videos is a series that parodies the show \"Undercover Boss.\" Those videos helped Yay's amass tens of thousands of TikTok followers, who keep buying the jerky, Cheng said. At one point, TikTok sales comprised nearly 90% of Yay's total revenue, with monthly sales from the app peaking at $75,000 last November, Cheng said. Yay's is prepared to divert to Amazon and its own website if TikTok is banned, but as long as TikTok is \"still here, we're going to do what we can to stay on top,\" Cheng said. \"If we were sitting here worrying about what's next, we would've never gotten on TikTok Shop,\" Cheng said. \"We're enjoying it while it's hot.\"\nCraig Sjodin/ Disney ABC Television Group/ Getty Images\nCompeting with Amazon\nScrub Daddy, known for its smiley face-shaped sponges, went viral on TikTok during the Covid pandemic and counts more than 4 million followers. Its top video, a demonstration of its Damp Duster sponge, has 30 million views while its bestselling product on TikTok Shop has been purchased nearly 76,000 times, according to the app. That figure doesn't account for items that have been returned after purchase. After kicking off in 2012 with an appearance on \"Shark Tank,\" Scrub Daddy CEO Aaron Krause said he lost faith in traditional marketing efforts. \"We did a TV ad, we did some outdoor ads on billboards, we did a little bit of radio,\" Krause said. \"All I found was that I was throwing money into the air.\"\nwatch now\nThe company pivoted toward social media marketing, primarily on Instagram, which turned out to be a \"pot of gold,\" Krause said. Scrub Daddy set up an account on TikTok in 2020 and worked with influencers to promote its products, including Vanesa Amaro, a popular account for housecleaning content with more than 5.7 million followers. After Amaro recommended the sponges to her viewers, Scrub Daddy sold 30,000 units in one weekend, Krause said. TikTok's \"algorithm just allows you to hit millions and millions of views with one hysterically crazy video,\" he said. In recent months, TikTok has encouraged retailers and sellers to host hourslong livestreams multiple times per week as a way to connect with shoppers. Many brands have invested in building out their own studios to record the shows or have hired talent to host them. Scrub Daddy snatched up longtime QVC host Dan Hughes after he was laid off from the home shopping company in 2023. Others, like Beachwaver, have turned their CEOs into on-screen talent. TikTok Shop was a big topic of conversation at a conference for Amazon sellers in New York in October. A session on \"how to scale your brand\" with TikTok Shop drew a packed room of sellers who listened to e-commerce strategist Rafay MH talk up the potential for brands to haul in $8 million to $10 million in sales from TikTok in less than a year. \"Amazon comes with a ton of competition,\" MH said. \"TikTok is the opportunity for free eyeballs and sales.\" Many Amazon sellers have embraced TikTok after they were initially slow to join the platform, said Michelle Barnum Smith, who provides consulting services to online businesses. \"I was the bedraggled gold miner standing on the street corners of New York, saying 'There's gold in those hills,' and people were like, 'Yeah, sure,'\" Barnum Smith said \"But as soon as they started seeing their competition on there, or their buddy on there, they were like, 'I've got to get on there.'\" There's now \"extreme FOMO,\" or fear of missing out, among Amazon sellers to join TikTok even if it no longer exists in the U.S. next year, Barnum Smith said. \"Whatever the future looks like for TikTok Shop, they're happy to take that money now and get while the getting's good,\" Barnum Smith said. Correction: Vanesa Amaro is a TikTok influencer. An earlier version misspelled her name. Disclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank.\n\ntitle3:\nThe Browser Company teases Dia, its new AI browser\ndescription3:\nThe Browser Company, the company behind Arc Browser for both desktop and mobile, teased its new web browser Monday called Dia \u2014 and this time, it focuses on AI tools. In the last few years, the startup launched Arc on Mac and Windows and Arc Search on iOS and Android, but the company is beginning work on a new product with a broader appeal.\nThe browser is set to launch in early 2025. The startup has launched a new website that shows a video about the browser and lists different open roles in the company.\n\u201cAI won\u2019t exist as an app. Or a button. We believe it\u2019ll be an entirely new environment \u2014 built on top of a web browser,\u201d the browser\u2019s site reads.\nIn the video, the Browser Company CEO, Josh Miller, showed some early prototypes of some of its features. One demo showed a tool that works at the insertion cursor, which will help you write the next sentence or fetch facts from the internet when writing about a known subject, such as the original iPhone\u2019s launch and specs. The tool also seems to understand your browser window and can fetch Amazon links that you have opened to insert them in an email with a basic description.\nThe second demo shows that users can type in commands in the address bar to perform various actions, like fetch a document based on the description, email it to someone based on your preferred email client that you use in the browser, and schedule a calendar meeting through a natural language prompt.\nSome of these features sound like what any browser-based writing tools or calendar tools might already do, and we won\u2019t know their usefulness or uniqueness until we actually get to use Dia.\nThe third demo is more ambitious: It shows the browser doing actions on your behalf, like adding items from an email to your Amazon cart. Dia does it by browsing Amazon on its own, finding these items, and adding them to your cart. In the demo, the list has \u201can all-purpose hammer,\u201d and the auto-browsing function adds an Amazon listing with two hammers with a grip. I have no idea if that is the right choice, but it\u2019s likely that it isn\u2019t going to make the perfect decision every time right out of the gate \u2014 we have already seen that with the Rabbit R1.\nAnother example shows the browser looking at a Notion table filled with details of members for a video shoot. Dia can email each participant separately.\nThe Browser Company is not unique in thinking about building an AI assistant that will understand the interface and do tasks for you. Multiple startups have demos, concepts, and visions of AI models and tools that can control your screen.\nIn a video last month, Miller hinted about building new products for the masses, while assuring current users that it is not planning to meddle a lot with Arc\u2019s design and workings. Miller admitted that while Arc has a passionate and growing user base, its complexity might not appeal to all users. The challenge for the company would be to produce a browser that has AI features that work seamlessly and that could possibly create revenue sources for the company.\n\ntitle4:\nJeff Bezos backs AI chipmaker Tenstorrent\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAI hardware startup Tenstorrent raised nearly $700 million in new funding.\nTenstorrent raised a $693 million Series D round that values the company at more than $2.6 billion, Bloomberg first reported. The round was led by Samsung Securities and AFW Partners. Other investors include Hyundai and Jeff Bezos\u2019 Bezos Expeditions, among others.\nThe Toronto-based company said it plans to use the capital to build out its engineering team and to build artificial intelligence training servers to demonstrate its technology. Jim Keller, famed microprocessor engineer and Tenstorrent CEO, told Bloomberg that the company plans to release a new AI processor every two years and has signed customer contracts totaling nearly $150 million.\nTenstorrent was founded in 2016 and is one of the many startups in the current race to chip away at Nvidia\u2019s dominant AI chip market share. Other AI chip startups include Axelera, Etched and Groq, among many others.\"\n\nResponse:",
