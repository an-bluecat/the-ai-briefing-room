Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday November 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nRamp hits $32B valuation, just 3 months after hitting $22.5B\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nThe one area outside of AI where investors are still enthusiastic is expense management fintech, at least if Ramp\u2019s 2025 is anything to judge by. Every few months, Ramp has raised another large sum at another giant new valuation. On Monday, the fintech announced it had raised $300 million led by Lightspeed, which also included an employee tender offer.\nThis is just a few months after a $500 million Series E-2 at a $22.5 billion valuation led by Iconiq, announced on July 30. That round was just a few weeks after a $200 million Series E at a $16 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, announced in mid-June. And that Series E was just three months after a $150 million secondary share sale at a $13 billion valuation in March.\nIn April 2024, Ramp had raised a $150 million Series D co-led by Khosla and Founders Fund at a $7.65 billion valuation.\nWith Monday\u2019s round, Ramp has raised $2.3 billion in total equity financing, it says. And in 2025 alone, the company leapt from being worth $13 billion to $32 billion.\nRamp in October said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue, meaning it was on a trajectory to bring in that much on a 12-month basis.\nRamp today offers corporate expense management. While it has an AI story to tell \u2014 automating some approvals and processes via agentic offerings \u2014 it is not an AI company per se. It offers corporate credit cards, expense management/purchase order software, and corporate travel. The company says it has surpassed 50,000 customers.\n\ntitle1:\nDoorDash confirms data breach impacting users\u2019 phone numbers and physical addresses\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nDoorDash disclosed a data breach that exposed the personal information of an unspecified number of users, which included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses.\nDespite the fact that hackers stole phone numbers and physical addresses, DoorDash said that \u201cno sensitive information was accessed by the unauthorized third party and we have no indication the data has been misused for fraud or identity theft at this time.\u201d\nDoorDash said in the post that the breach impacted a mix of customers, delivery workers, and merchants.\nCompany spokesperson Michelle Babin did not respond when asked exactly how many users were victims of the breach. Instead, Babin sent a statement that largely echoed the blog post about the breach.\nThe breach originated from an employee falling for a social engineering attack. When the company identified the breach, it shut down the hackers\u2019 access to its systems, started an investigation, and reported the incident to law enforcement, according to a post published last week by the company.\nDoorDash said no \u201cSocial Security numbers, other government-issued identification numbers, driver\u2019s license information, or bank or payment card information\u201d were stolen as part of the breach.\nThe company said it has notified impacted users.\nThis story has been updated to include DoorDash\u2019s spokesperson response.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta releases a new tool to protect reels creators from having their work stolen\ndescription2:\nFacebook creators are getting a new tool to help them protect their work from being ripped off by others. On Monday, Meta introduced Facebook content protection, a mobile tool designed to detect when a creator\u2019s original reels posted to Facebook are being used without their permission.\nIf the creator is alerted that someone else is using their reels, they\u2019ll also have the ability to block the reel\u2019s visibility across both Facebook and Instagram or track the reel\u2019s performance and optionally add attribution links to their work.\nOr they can opt to release their claim on the reel, allowing it to remain visible on Meta\u2019s platforms.\nMeta says the addition of the content protection feature is part of its work to help original creators succeed on Facebook, without being drowned out by copycats. As part of this initiative, Meta said in July it had taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators and had taken action against 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement.\nImage Credits:Meta\nAlthough the new system also works to protect original content that\u2019s posted on Instagram, it requires that creators post their reels to Facebook to have them tracked. This also works if the creator is using the cross-posting option from Instagram to \u201cShare to Facebook.\u201d\nThe move could encourage more creators to share their work on Facebook as a result.\nThe new content protection system is automatically being provided to Facebook creators in its Facebook Content Monetization program who also meet enhanced integrity and originality standards, the company says. In addition, access to the new program is rolling out to creators who use Rights Manager.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nImage Credits:Meta\nCreators can see if they\u2019re eligible by looking for notifications in their Feed, Professional Dashboard, and profile, or they can check to see if they have access to the tool from their Professional Dashboard, under \u201cContent Protection.\u201d They can also apply for access on Facebook\u2019s website.\nTo work, the tool uses the same matching technology as is currently used by Meta\u2019s Rights Manager for copyright holders. It will also show the percentage match for each match it surfaces, as well as other details, like views, follower count, and monetization status.\nThe company says it\u2019s giving creators control over if and how the system flags matches. For instance, if the creator has given permission to another account to use their content, they can add them to an \u201callow list\u201d so those duplicate reels aren\u2019t automatically flagged.\nImage Credits:Meta\nCreators can also release their claim on a video on a one-off basis, or, if they choose to track the performance of a reel on another creator\u2019s account, they can opt to add attribution links. These links will add an \u201coriginal\u201d label to the reel that links back to the creator\u2019s profile, page, or, in some cases, the original reel itself.\nMeta tells us it\u2019s currently running tests for linking back to the original reel, but linking to the page or profile is the default.\nIf they block the reel, its distribution is impacted, but the account that stole the reel doesn\u2019t receive any disciplinary action. This could be because Meta doesn\u2019t want the system abused to target specific accounts. In addition, it says that if creators abuse the system, creators submitting false reports could see restrictions against their own accounts or they could lose access to the tool.\nTracking reels is the default setting, Facebook notes.\nCreators will also be able to dispute instances where another account tries to protect a piece of the creator\u2019s original work. To do so, creators can submit a copyright takedown request through the IP reporting channel. (They can also submit a report if they find a match that the tool didn\u2019t surface, via a \u201cCan\u2019t find a specific match?\u201d option on the content protection overview screen.)\nFor the time being, the new tool is mobile-only, but Meta tells TechCrunch it\u2019s testing adding it to the Professional Dashboard on the desktop.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle rolls out its AI 'Flight Deals' tool globally, adds new travel features in Search\ndescription3:\nGoogle is rolling out new AI-powered features to book and plan travel in Search, the company announced on Monday. The tech giant is expanding availability for its AI-powered \u201cFlight Deals\u201d tool, adding the ability for users to organize travel plans with its \u201cCanvas\u201d tool in AI Mode, and launching agentic booking capabilities to more people.\nGoogle first launched Flight Deals back in August in the U.S., Canada, and India. Now, the company is expanding the AI-powered search tool within Google Flights globally to help people quickly find affordable destinations.\nTo get started, users need to describe where, when, and how they want to travel. Flight Deals will then use AI to display the best bargains available.\nFlight Deals is now rolling out to more than 200 countries and territories worldwide, including the U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, and Korea. The tool is also getting support for more than 60 languages.\nImage Credits:Google\nAs for the new AI Mode features, Google says users can now use the built-in Canvas tool to create travel plans. Canvas, which first launched as a way to build study plans and organize information over multiple sessions in a side panel, can now help users plan their upcoming trips.\nUsers need to tell AI mode what type of trip they\u2019re looking for and then select the \u201cCreate with Canvas\u201d option.\n\u201cRight away, you\u2019ll get a plan in the Canvas side panel that brings together real-time Search data for flights and hotels, details from Google Maps like photos and reviews and relevant information from sites across the web,\u201d Google explained in a blog post. \u201cYou\u2019ll find suggestions that fit your criteria, like hotel comparisons based on pricing and amenities or ideas for restaurants and activities optimized by travel time from where you\u2019re staying.\u201d\nUsers can then ask follow-up questions and get help with tradeoffs, like choosing a hotel that\u2019s closer to a brunch place you want to try but a bit farther from the hiking trails you want to explore.\nImage Credits:Google\nTravel planning with Canvas is available on desktop in the U.S. for users who are opted into the AI Mode experiment in Labs.\nAdditionally, Google announced that it\u2019s bringing AI Mode\u2019s agentic capabilities to more people. Earlier this year, Google announced that users who were opted into Labs could now get help with booking restaurant reservations, event tickets, and beauty and wellness appointments in AI Mode. Now, the company is making this capability available to all U.S. users.\nUsers can request dinner reservations based on multiple preferences, such as party size, date, time, location, and preferred cuisine. AI Mode will then search across different reservation platforms to find real-time availability for restaurants that match the inquiry. It then surfaces a curated list of options to choose from.\nIn the future, Google says it will make it possible to finish booking flights and hotels directly in AI Mode. Users will be able to describe what they\u2019re looking for and then compare different flights or hotels and browse information like schedules, prices, room photos, amenities, and reviews.\n\ntitle4:\nJeff Bezos reportedly returns to the trenches as co-CEO of new AI startup, Project Prometheus\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAmazon\u2019s founder Jeff Bezos seems to be getting his hands dirty once again: The billionaire is partly backing a new AI startup called Project Prometheus that has raised $6.2 billion in funding, and will take on duties as co-chief executive of the new venture, The New York Times reported, citing several sources familiar with the project.\nBezos will share the position with Vik Bajaj, who previously led and co-founded Google\u2019s life sciences division. Bajaj also co-founded Verily, a biotech startup owned by Alphabet, and is the co-founder of Foresite Labs, an AI-focused affiliate of investment firm Foresite Capital, though the report notes he recently left the firm to start Prometheus, the report said.\nBezos would be returning to operations for the first time since he stepped away from Amazon in 2021.\nAccording to the NYT, the startup is going to build AI products for engineering and manufacturing in various fields like computers, aerospace, and automobiles. Project Prometheus is focused on \u201cAI for the physical economy,\u201d per its LinkedIn page, and the report noted that its work will resemble that of Periodic Labs, which is building technology to speed up scientific research by simulating the physical world to train AI models.\nThe company already has almost 100 staff, including researchers from AI firms like Meta, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind, the report said.\nAmazon and Bajaj did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
