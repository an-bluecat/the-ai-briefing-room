The show started with CEO Sam Altman himself, speaking directly to the audience.\n\u201cWe think AI represents a rare, once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be,\u201d Altman said. \u201cIn the same way that, for the previous way people used the internet, the URL bar and the search box were a great analogue, what we\u2019re starting to see is that the chat experience and the web browser can be a quick analogue.\u201d\nIt was an inspiring note, in the classic Steve Jobs mode. But even more important than Altman\u2019s browser was the detritus he was sweeping aside to make room. It wasn\u2019t just casting present-day browsers as old, but part of a whole package of goods that are about to be replaced by AI \u2014 as Altman put it, part of \u201cthe previous way people used the internet.\u201d And most of those soon-to-be obsolete services trace back to a single company: Google.\nOpenAI\u2019s browser project has been an open secret in Silicon Valley since at least this summer \u2014 and it was clear from the beginning that it would be a potential threat to Google, current owner of the world\u2019s most popular browser. But Tuesday\u2019s product and presentation details made it clear exactly how much the web giant has to lose in the AI era \u2014 and how little the Google\u2019s success with Gemini seems to have helped.\nThe immediate threat is simple enough: ChatGPT draws 800 million users a week, and if those users switch to Atlas, they\u2019re most likely switching away from Chrome. Losing those users doesn\u2019t have an immediate dollar cost for Google (it\u2019s a free product, after all) but it limits Google\u2019s ability to target ads to those users or nudge them to Google Search \u2014 a particular sore point because, just last month, Google was barred by the US Department of Justice from making any search exclusivity deals.\nThen, there\u2019s how OpenAI deals with search itself. AI has already strained the search model of the web, surfacing processed information instead of content that can be advertised against. But on OpenAI\u2019s livestream, Atlas head of engineering Ben Goodger (himself a central figure in developing both Firefox and Chrome) described the new kind of chat-oriented search as a paradigm shift.\n\u201cThis new model of search is really powerful,\u201d Goodger said. \u201cIt\u2019s a multi-turn experience. You can have this back-and-forth with your search results instead of just being sent off to a web page.\u201d\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOf course, Google has done a lot to integrate AI into the normal search experience \u2014 but the company has mostly approached it the same way as product listings or reviews: by adding a box to the results page. But OpenAI\u2019s kind of engaged back-and-forth is beyond anything you can get on Chrome, and given its profoundly different approach, it\u2019s not something that can be easily copied. If OpenAI\u2019s search interface proves popular, it could be a serious threat to Google\u2019s dominance.\nThen there\u2019s the advertising question. OpenAI doesn\u2019t serve advertising at the moment, but it has been careful not to rule it out. The company has also been listing a lot of adtech jobs lately, fueling speculation that an ad pivot might be on the way. With Atlas, ChatGPT can now collect context directly from a user\u2019s browser window \u2014 providing a lot of extremely valuable data for ad targeting. It\u2019s an unprecedented level of direct browser access: literally looking at the words on your screen as you type them. And after decades of privacy scares, it\u2019s not the kind of sensitive information that users are likely to give to Google or Meta.\nIt\u2019s still early days for Atlas and a lot will depend on the product itself \u2014 and whether users really want what OpenAI is offering here. But the company has plotted a surprisingly commercial path here, one focused on user and revenue growth rather than hazy ambitions around AGI. As infrastructure wonks ponder the $300 billion question of whether OpenAI\u2019s revenues can ever live up to its enormous data center buildout, products like Atlas may be the first place to look for an answer.\n\ntitle1:\nNetflix goes \u2018all in\u2019 on generative AI as entertainment industry remains divided\ndescription1:\nAs the entertainment industry reckons with when and how to use generative AI in filmmaking, Netflix is leaning in. In its quarterly earnings report released on Tuesday afternoon, Netflix wrote in its letter to investors that it is \u201cvery well positioned to effectively leverage ongoing advances in AI.\u201d\nNetflix isn\u2019t planning to use generative AI as the backbone of its content but believes the technology has potential as a tool to make creatives more efficient.\n\u201cIt takes a great artist to make something great,\u201d Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos said on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call. \u201cAI can give creatives better tools to enhance their overall TV/movie experience for our members, but it doesn\u2019t automatically make you a great storyteller if you\u2019re not.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Netflix said it used generative AI in final footage for the first time in the Argentine show \u201cThe Eternaut\u201d to create a scene of a building collapsing. Since then, the filmmakers behind \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u201d used generative AI to make characters look younger in the film\u2019s opening scene, while the producers of \u201cBillionaires\u2019 Bunker\u201d used the technology as a pre-production tool to envision wardrobe and set design.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster, and in new ways,\u201d Sarandos said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in on that, but we\u2019re not chasing novelty for novelty\u2019s sake here.\u201d\nAI has been a contentious topic in the entertainment industry, as artists worry that LLM-powered tools that non-consensually used their work as training data have the potential to negatively impact their jobs.\nWith Netflix as a bellwether, it seems that studios are more likely to use generative AI for special effects rather than to replace the role of actors \u2014 even if an AI actor recently caused an uproar among Hollywood actors, despite not yet booking any gigs (that we know of). These behind-the-scenes AI uses still have the potential to impact visual effects jobs, however.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThese debates recently escalated when ChatGPT-maker OpenAI unveiled its Sora 2 audio and video generation model, which was released without guardrails that prevent users from generating videos of some actors and historical figures. Just this week, the Hollywood trade organization SAG-AFTRA and actor Bryan Cranston urged OpenAI to institute stronger guardrails against deepfaking actors like Cranston himself.\nWhen an investor asked Sarandos about the impact of Sora on Netflix, he said that it \u201cstarts to make sense\u201d that content creators could be impacted, but he\u2019s less worried about the movie and TV business \u2014 or so he tells investors.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not worried about AI replacing creativity,\u201d he said.\nNetflix\u2019s quarterly revenue grew 17% year-over-year to $11.5 billion, though this fell below the company\u2019s forecast.\n\ntitle2:\nOpen source agentic startup LangChain hits $1.25B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nLangChain raised $125 million at a $1.25 billion valuation, the company announced on Monday. TechCrunch reported in July that the provider of a popular open source framework for building AI agents was raising fresh funds at a valuation of at least $1 billion. The deal was led by IVP, as we previously reported. New investors CapitalG and Sapphire Ventures joined in, as did existing investors Sequoia, Benchmark, and Amplify.\nLangChain began in 2022 as an open source project founded by machine learning engineer Harrison Chase. The startup was an early darling of the AI era, solving problems that made building apps with early-stage LLMs difficult, such as searching the web, calling APIs, and interacting with databases. It became a smash hit project, and Chase launched a startup with a $10 million seed round from Benchmark in April 2023. A week later, Chase raised a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia, reportedly valuing LangChain at $200 million.\nAs state-of-the-art model makers have added more infrastructure, LangChain has evolved to become a platform for building agents. In addition to announcing its unicorn status, the company launched updates to all of its major products, including its agent builder LangChain, its orchestration and context/memory tool LangGraph, and its testing/observability tool LangSmith. LangChain remains hugely popular among open source devs, with 118,000 stars and 19.4 forks on GitHub.\n\ntitle3:\nCloudflare CEO Matthew Prince is pushing UK regulator to unbundle Google's search and AI crawlers\ndescription3:\nAfter earlier this year launching a marketplace that allows websites to charge AI bots for scraping their content, web infrastructure provider Cloudflare is pushing for increased regulation in the AI sector.\nThe company\u2019s chief executive Matthew Prince says he\u2019s in London to speak with the U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), where he\u2019s proposing stricter rules on how Google should be able to compete in the AI race, given its search dominance.\nThe CMA earlier this month designated Google with a special status in the search and advertising markets because of its \u201csubstantial and entrenched\u201d position. The move will allow the regulator to impose more stringent regulations beyond just search and ads, including in areas like Google\u2019s AI Overviews and AI Mode, the Discover feed, Top Stories, and News tab.\nAccording to Prince, Cloudflare is in a good position to make recommendations because it\u2019s not in the AI business itself, but has a large number of relationships with the AI companies themselves.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a dog directly in the fight. We\u2019re not an AI company,\u201d Prince said, speaking at the Bloomberg Tech conference in London this week. \u201cWe\u2019re not a media publisher, but we\u2019re this network that sits between them. 80% of the AI companies are our customers,\u201d he added.\nThe Cloudflare boss believes that Google should have to compete on the same footing as other AI companies, which is not what it\u2019s doing today, he said. Rather, Google uses its existing web crawler to crawl content for its AI products and services, in addition to its search engine. This, Prince said, gives Google an unfair advantage. (Prince is referring to Googlebot, which crawls for Search, including its AI features, like AI Overviews. A Google spokesperson, Ned Adriance, said that site owners can opt out of having content used for training AI products with Google Extended, which doesn\u2019t impact a site\u2019s inclusion in Google Search. Some media companies would likely prefer to opt fully out of AI features, however, so the point largely stands.)\n\u201cGoogle is saying, \u2018we have an absolute God-given right to all of the content in the world, even if we don\u2019t pay for it, because look what we did for the last 27 years,\u201d Prince explained. \u201cAnd, they\u2019re saying we can take it and use the same crawler we use for search in order to power our AI systems. And if you want to opt out of one, you have to opt out of both,\u201d he noted.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThis, obviously, is not feasible for most, particularly those in the media business, where losing search means losing about 20% of your revenue, the executive said.\n\u201cBut it gets even worse. If you block Google\u2019s crawler, it blocks their ad safety team, which means that your advertisements across all of your platforms stop working, which is just a non-starter,\u201d Prince added.\nBecause Google bundles its crawler, it\u2019s able to get access to content that others, like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Perplexity, would have to pay for.\n\u201cThe problem is that we then will have effectively handed the game to Google,\u201d he said.\nThe solution, Prince said, is to foster a lot of competition in the market, where potentially thousands of AI companies could compete to buy content from thousands of media businesses and millions of small businesses. He suggested that what the U.K.\u2019s CMA was doing by flagging Google as a potential regulatory target was a thoughtful move, and one that indicates they\u2019re aware of Google\u2019s unique advantage.\nCloudflare has also provided the CMA with data that shows how Google\u2019s crawler works and why it\u2019s nearly impossible for other players to replicate the same success Google could have.\nPrince isn\u2019t the only one to share these opinions in recent days. Last month, Neil Vogel, CEO of People, Inc., the largest digital and print publisher in the United States, which operates over 40 media brands, said essentially the same thing. In an interview, he called out Google as a \u201cbad actor,\u201d saying that media companies had no choice but to let Google crawl their sites for AI content because of the way the crawlers were combined.\nVogel, whose company had adopted Cloudflare\u2019s solution to block AI crawlers that don\u2019t pay, claimed the system was working, as he said deal discussions were underway with several large LLM providers.\nUpdated with Google comment.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon identifies the issue that broke much of the internet, says AWS is back to normal\ndescription4:\nAn outage on Monday affected web hosting giant Amazon Web Services (AWS), which took out vast swathes of the web, including websites, banks, and some government services. On Monday afternoon, the company offered an update on the cause of the issue and said it was working to restore services. At 6:01 p.m. ET, Amazon said all AWS services had returned to normal operations.\nIn an announcement on the Amazon website, the company shared that the underlying issue was related to DNS resolution. DNS, or Domain Name System, is a system that converts web addresses into IP addresses so that customer apps and websites can load. While some glitches can be resolved quickly, DNS issues can sometimes take longer to resolve.\n\u201cAWS reported increased error rates for multiple services and determined that the issue was related to DNS resolution of the DynamoDB API endpoints in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) Region,\u201d the announcement stated. \u201cThe underlying DNS issue was fully mitigated at 2:24 AM PDT.\u201d\nThough the issue itself was fixed, Amazon needed more time to \u201cfully restore service,\u201d which it said it was doing \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d The company also said that the issue affected Amazon.com and its subsidiaries, as well as AWS customer support operations.\nAmazon said on Monday evening Eastern time that the outage had been \u201cfully mitigated\u201d and that most services are returning to normal after an hours-long stretch during which much of the internet could not load.\nSeveral major apps were not working. Coinbase, Fortnite, Signal, Perplexity, Venmo, and Zoom faced lengthy outages, as did Amazon\u2019s own services, including its Ring video surveillance products. The outage even disrupted Eight Sleep\u2019s cooling pods, disturbing the sleep of users.\nMillions of companies and organizations rely on AWS to host their websites, apps, and other critical online systems. The company has data centers all over the world, and Amazon is said to have at least 30% of the total cloud market.\nBefore this, the most recent global internet outage was in 2024, when cybersecurity giant CrowdStrike published a buggy update to its anti-malware engine, causing millions of computers around the world to crash and resulting in airport delays and mass outages. Systems globally took several days to return to normal.\nPrior to that, a malfunction at DNS provider Akamai in 2021 caused some of the world\u2019s largest websites to drop off the internet for several hours, including FedEx, Steam, and the PlayStation Network.\nAmazon advised customers to refer to the AWS Health Dashboard for more detailed information on the outage and how it was being resolved.\"\n\nResponse:",
