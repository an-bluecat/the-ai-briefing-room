Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday February 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nThe hottest AI models, what they do, and how to use them\ndescription0:\nAI models are being cranked out at a dizzying pace, by everyone from Big Tech companies like Google to startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. Keeping track of the latest ones can be overwhelming.\nAdding to the confusion is that AI models are often promoted based on industry benchmarks. But these technical metrics often reveal little about how real people and companies actually use them.\nTo cut through the noise, TechCrunch has compiled an overview of the most advanced AI models released since 2024, with details on how to use them and what they\u2019re best for. We\u2019ll keep this list updated with the latest launches, too.\nThere are literally over a million AI models out there: HuggingFace, for example, hosts over 1.4 million. So this list might miss some models that perform better, in one way or another.\nAI models released in 2025\nOpenAI o3-mini\nThis is OpenAI\u2019s latest reasoning model and is optimized for STEM-related tasks like coding, math, and science. It\u2019s not OpenAI\u2019s most powerful model but because it\u2019s smaller, the company says it\u2019s significantly lower-cost. It is available for free but requires a subscription for heavy users.\nOpenAI Deep Research\nOpenAI\u2019s Deep Research is designed for doing in-depth research on a topic with clear citations. This service is only available with ChatGPT\u2019s $200 per month Pro subscription. OpenAI recommends it for everything from science to shopping research, but beware that hallucinations remain a problem for AI.\nMistral Le Chat\nMistral has launched app versions of Le Chat, a multimodal AI personal assistant. Mistral claims Le Chat responds faster than any other chatbot. It also has a paid version with up-to-date journalism from the AFP. Tests from Le Monde found Le Chat\u2019s performance impressive, although it made more errors than ChatGPT.\nOpenAI Operator\nOpenAI\u2019s Operator is meant to be a personal intern that can do things independently, like help you buy groceries. It requires a $200 a month ChatGPT pro subscription. AI agents hold a lot of promise, but they\u2019re still experimental: a Washington Post reviewer says Operator decided on its own to order a dozen eggs for $31, paid with the reviewer\u2019s credit card.\nGoogle Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental\nGoogle Gemini\u2019s much-awaited flagship model says it excels at coding and understanding general knowledge. It also has a super-long context window of 2 million tokens, helping users who need to quickly process massive chunks of text. The service requires (at minimum) a Google One AI Premium subscription of $19.99 a month.\nAI models released in 2024\nDeepSeek R1\nThis Chinese AI model took Silicon Valley by storm. DeepSeek\u2019s R1 performs well on coding and math, while its open source nature means anyone can run it locally. Plus, it\u2019s free. However, R1 integrates Chinese government censorship and faces rising bans for potentially sending user data back to China.\nGemini Deep Research\nDeep Research summarizes Google\u2019s search results in a simple and well-cited document. The service is helpful for students and anyone else who needs a quick research summary. However, its quality isn\u2019t nearly as good as an actual peer-reviewed paper. Deep Research requires a $19.99 Google One AI Premium subscription.\nMeta Llama 3.3 7B\nThis is the newest and most advanced version of Meta\u2019s open source Llama AI models. Meta has touted this version as its cheapest and most efficient yet, especially for math, general knowledge, and instruction following. It is free and open source.\nOpenAI Sora\nSora is a model that creates realistic videos based on text. While it can generate entire scenes rather than just clips, OpenAI admits that it often generates \u201cunrealistic physics.\u201d It\u2019s currently only available on paid versions of ChatGPT, starting with Plus which is $20 a month.\nAlibaba Qwen QwQ-32B-Preview\nThis model is one of the few to rival OpenAI\u2019s o1 on certain industry benchmarks, excelling in math and coding. Ironically for a \u2018reasoning model,\u2019 it has \u201croom for improvement in common sense reasoning,\u201d Alibaba says. It also incorporates Chinese government censorship, TechCrunch testing shows. It\u2019s free and open source.\nAnthropic\u2019s Computer Use\nClaude\u2019s Computer Use is meant to take control of your computer to complete tasks like coding or booking a plane ticket, making it a predecessor of OpenAI\u2019s Operator. Computer use, however, remains in beta. Pricing is via API: $0.80 per million tokens of input, and $4 per million tokens of output.\nx.AI\u2019s Grok 2\nx.AI, the Elon Musk-owned AI company, has launched an enhanced version of its flagship Grok 2 chatbot it claims is \u201cthree times faster.\u201d Free users are limited to 10 questions every two hours on Grok, while subscribers to X\u2019s Premium and Premium+ plans enjoy higher usage limits. x.AI also launched an image generator, Aurora, that produces highly photorealistic images, including some graphic or violent content.\nOpenAI o1\nOpenAI\u2019s o1 family is meant to produce better answers by \u201cthinking\u201d through responses through a hidden reasoning feature. The model excels at coding, math, and safety, OpenAI claims, but has issues deceiving humans, too. O1 requires subscribing to ChatGPT Plus, which is $20 a month.\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5\nClaude Sonnet 3.5 is a model Anthropic claims as best-in-class. It\u2019s become known for its coding capabilities and is considered a tech insider\u2019s chatbot of choice. The model can be accessed for free on Claude although heavy users will need a $20 monthly Pro subscription. While it can understand images, it can\u2019t generate them.\nOpenAI GPT 4o-mini\nOpenAI has touted GPT 4o-mini as its most affordable and fastest model yet thanks to its small size. It\u2019s meant to enable a broad range of tasks like powering customer service chatbots. The model is available on ChatGPT\u2019s free tier. It\u2019s better suited for high-volume simple tasks compared to more complex ones.\nCohere Command R+\nCohere\u2019s Command R+ model excels at complex Retrieval-Augmented Generation (or RAG) applications for enterprises. That means it can find and cite specific pieces of information really well. (The inventor of RAG actually works at Cohere.) Still, RAG doesn\u2019t fully solve AI\u2019s hallucination problem.\n\ntitle1:\nThe New York Times has greenlit AI tools for product and edit staff\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nThe New York Times is now allowing its product and editorial teams to use AI tools, which might one day write social copy, SEO headlines, and code, reports Semafor.\nThe news came to staff via an email, in which the publication announced the debut of its new internal AI summary tool called Echo.\nThe New York Times also shared a suite of AI products that staff could use to build web products or develop editorial ideas, alongside editorial guidelines for using AI tools. The paper\u2019s editorial staff is encouraged to use AI tools to suggest edits, brainstorm interview questions, and help with research. At the same time, staff was warned not to use AI to draft or significantly revise an article or input confidential source information.\nThose guidelines also suggest the Times might use AI to implement digitally voiced articles and translations into other languages.\nSemafor reports that The Times said it would approve AI programs like GitHub Copilot programming assistant for coding, Google\u2019s Vertex AI for product development, NotebookLM, some Amazon AI products, and OpenAI\u2019s non-ChatGPT API through a business account.\nThe New York Times\u2019s embrace of AI tools comes as it is still embroiled in a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly violating copyright law by training generative AI on the publisher\u2019s content.\n\ntitle2:\nWhat the US' first major AI copyright ruling might mean for IP law\ndescription2:\nCopyright claims against AI companies just got a potential boost.\nA U.S. federal judge last week handed down a summary judgment in a case brought by tech conglomerate Thomson Reuters against legal tech firm Ross Intelligence. The judge found that Ross\u2019 use of Reuters\u2019 content to train its AI legal research platform infringed on Reuters\u2019 intellectual property.\nThe outcome could have implications for the more than 39 copyright-related AI lawsuits currently working their way through U.S. courthouses. That said, it\u2019s not necessarily a slam dunk for plaintiffs who allege that AI companies violated their IP rights.\nAll about the headnotes\nRoss was accused of using headnotes \u2014 summaries of legal decisions \u2014 from Westlaw, Reuters\u2019 legal research service, to train its AI. Ross marketed its AI as a tool to analyze documents and perform query-based searches across court filings.\nRoss argued that its use of copyrighted headnotes was legally defensible because it was transformative, meaning it repurposed the headnotes to serve a markedly different function or market. In his summary judgment, Stephanos Bibas, the judge presiding over the case, didn\u2019t find that argument particularly convincing.\nRoss, Bibas said in his opinion, was repackaging Westlaw headnotes in a way that directly replicated Westlaw\u2019s legal research service. The startup\u2019s platform didn\u2019t add new meaning, purpose, or commentary, Bibas determined \u2014 undermining Ross\u2019 claim of transformative use.\nIn his decision, Bibas also cited Ross\u2019 commercial motivations as a reason the startup\u2019s defense missed the mark. Ross sought to profit from a product that competed directly with Westlaw, and without significant \u201crecontextualization\u201d of the IP-protected Westlaw material.\nShubha Ghosh, a Syracuse University professor who studies IP law, called it a \u201cstrong victory\u201d for Thomson Reuters.\n\u201cThe trial will proceed, [but] Thomson Reuters was awarded a summary judgment, a victory at this stage of the litigation,\u201d Ghosh said. \u201cThe judge also affirmed that Ross wasn\u2019t entitled to summary judgment on its defenses, such as fair use and merger. As a consequence, the case continues to trial with a strong victory for Thomson Reuters.\u201d\nNarrow in application\nAlready, at least one set of plaintiffs in another AI copyright case have asked a court to consider Bibas\u2019 decision. But it\u2019s not yet clear whether the precedent will sway other judges.\nBibas\u2019 opinion made a point of distinguishing between \u201cgenerative AI\u201d and the AI that Ross was using, which didn\u2019t generate content but merely spit back judicial opinions that were already written.\nGenerative AI, which is at the center of copyright lawsuits against companies such as OpenAI and Midjourney, is frequently trained on massive amounts of content from public sources around the web. When fed lots of examples, generative AI can generate speech, text, images, videos, music, and more.\nMost companies developing generative AI argue that fair use doctrines shield their practice of scraping data and using it for training without compensating \u2014 or even crediting \u2014 the data\u2019s owners. They argue that they\u2019re entitled to use any publicly available content for training and that their models are in effect outputting transformative works.\nBut not every copyright holder agrees. Some point to the phenomenon known as regurgitation, where generative AI creates content closely resembling the work it was trained on.\nRandy McCarthy, a U.S. patent attorney at the law firm Hall Estill, said Bibas\u2019 focus on the \u201cimpacts upon the market for the original work\u201d could be key to rights holders\u2019 cases against generative AI developers. But he also cautioned that Bibas\u2019 opinion is relatively narrow and that it may be overturned on appeal.\n\u201cOne thing is clear, at least in this case: merely using copyrighted material as training data [for] an AI cannot be said to be fair use per se,\u201d McCarthy told TechCrunch. \u201c[But it\u2019s] one battle in a larger war, and we\u2019ll need to see more developments before we can extract from this the law pertaining to the use of copyrighted materials as AI training data.\u201d\nAnother attorney TechCrunch spoke with, Mark Lezama, a litigation partner at Knobbe Martens focusing on patent disputes, thinks Bibas\u2019 opinion could have wider implications. He\u2019s of the view that the judge\u2019s reasoning could extend to generative AI in its various forms.\n\u201cThe court rejected a fair-use defense as a matter of law in part because Ross used [Thomson Reuters] headnotes to develop a competing legal research system,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the court hinted this might be different from a situation involving generative AI, it\u2019s easy to see a news site arguing that copying its articles for training a generative AI is no different because the generative AI uses the copyrighted articles to compete with the news site for user attention.\u201d\nIn other words, publishers and copyright owners duking it out with AI companies have slight reason to be optimistic after the decision \u2014 emphasis on slight.\n\ntitle3:\nX is blocking links to Signal, a secure messaging platform used by federal workers\ndescription3:\nElon Musk\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) is blocking links to Signal.me, a URL shortener used by the private messaging app Signal that allows users to send out a link that\u2019s used to contact them directly through the service. The blocks, which impact direct messages, public posts, and profile pages, were first spotted by the blog Disruptionist.\nThe change comes as DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency) takes aim at federal agencies, including NASA and the Department of Education, leaving workers turning to Signal\u2019s encrypted messaging platform to securely share information and blow the whistle on potentially harmful activity.\nNearly 10,000 federal workers have been fired across the government as Musk\u2019s DOGE works to slash federal spending and shut down entire agencies, like USAID.\nX is blocking links to Signal.me. Image Credits:Rebecca Bellan\nTechCrunch has attempted to share a link via post and DM. When trying to share via a post, a message pops up that says: \u201cSomething went wrong, but don\u2019t fret \u2013 let\u2019s give it another shot.\u201d\nAny message with a link to Signal.me also fails to send, and a pop-up appears that says, \u201cThis request looks like it might be automated. To protect our users from spam and other malicious activity, we can\u2019t complete this action right now. Please try again later.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to X for comment.\nMusk is a self-described free-speech advocate, but he frequently attacks publications and individuals who have spoken out against his actions. He has also been accused of blocking accounts on X of people who have disagreed with him.\n\ntitle4:\nWhat to know about TikTok\u2019s uncertain future in the US and the people who want to buy it\ndescription4:\nTikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored.\nTikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store last week.\nNonetheless, TikTok\u2019s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform\u2019s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research\u2019s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.\nTikTok ban: What\u2019s happened so far\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives, in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok. On April 23, 2024, the Senate passed the bill.\nShortly after, President Joe Biden signed the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\nTrump has a change of heart\nOn December 27, 2024, Trump opposed the potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.\nIn January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as \u201cthe TikTok ban.\u201d TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.\nTikTok shuts down \u2026 then comes back online\nAlthough TikTok indeed shut itself down in the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn\u2019t last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. The platform noted, \u201cAs a result of President Trump\u2019s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.\u201d\nWhere we are today\nOn January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nNo definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.\nBelow is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly, Elon Musk is not among them.)\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok\nThe People\u2019s Bid for TikTok is a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt, who is also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid.
