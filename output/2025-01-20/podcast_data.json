Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Enthusiasts hope to see him create a crypto advisory council and establish a national bitcoin stockpile or reserve.\nThe flagship cryptocurrency was last lower by more than 2% at $103,558.38, according to Coin Metrics, in what appeared to be a \"buy the rumor sell the news\" event. Overnight, it rose as high as $109,350.72.\nOver the weekend, Trump launched the \"Official Trump\" meme coin, which on Monday morning had risen to a more than $10 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko. Returning First Lady Melania Trump launched her own \"Melania\" meme coin Sunday. They have attracted $31 billion and $7.2 billion in trading volumes, respectively, over the last day.\n\"Rumors that cryptocurrency may be declared a national interest by the United States during the inauguration are having a positive effect on the price of bitcoin,\" Gracy Chen, CEO of crypto exchange Bitget, told CNBC. \"I don't believe the rise in bitcoin's price is due to the launch of new meme tokens. Rather \u2026 without the release of the Trump family tokens, bitcoin's price would have grown more. Instead, capital shifted to new coins, limiting overall growth.\"\nThe broader crypto market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 index, fell 3.6% on Monday afternoon. Solana , down 9%, led the losses following a 14% rally over the weekend, benefitting from the Trump meme coin being launched on the popular Ethereum alternative network.\nMeme coins are considered the riskiest corner of the already risky cryptocurrency market, but the Trumps' coin launches over the weekend gave traders further conviction that the incoming administration will be positive for the industry, according to Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX.\n\"There is a logic here that would suggest that putting a stamp of approval on what could be perceived as the wildest of crypto assets, meme coins, is the best way to send a message of just how supportive the market should expect the administration to be when it comes to embracing crypto and making America a major player in the space,\" he told CNBC.\nNoelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter, echoed that sentiment, calling the meme drops net positive and \"a sign he is very much in favor of new ideas [and] new markets.\"\nBitcoin's new record opens the door to a possible upside extension to $130,000, LMAX's Kruger added.\n\ntitle1:\nWelcome to the era of gangster tech regulation\ndescription1:\nPresident Donald Trump is being sworn in today, and we are about to find out what happens when the government is actually as corrupt as our most brain-rotted conspiracy theorists imagine.\n\u201cTrump Inauguration, Awash in Cash, Runs Out of Perks for Big Donors,\u201d The New York Times reported, somewhat inaccurately. Sure, the Trump people ran out of VIP tickets, but that\u2019s not what the donors were buying. This is pure, obvious corruption \u2014 the kind that used to trigger shame, back when we were a populace that could still experience that emotion.\nSo what are these men buying?\nOur tech overlords all have problems, and they want to buy the solutions. I guess it was easier than making products people actually like.\nSo what are these men buying?\nReal market opportunities are rarer than they used to be. Tech executives and investors have become openly resentful about their products\u2019 societal repercussions and an unconscionable lack of adulation from the citizenry. Zuckerberg in particular seems bored with Facebook, his major moneymaker, and has been searching for a new toy. He spent at least $46 billion plus the cost of a company rebrand on the Metaverse, only to find that his Big New Thing didn\u2019t have legs. His latest Big New Thing is AR glasses, which are heavily reliant on whatever AI (and, likely, tariff) policy Trump will dictate.\nPerhaps nobody has spent more to buy a break from public scrutiny than the crypto industry\nNearly every major tech company has at least one lawsuit pending. Apple has an antitrust suit pending. Google just lost one. There\u2019s also a Federal Trade Commission suit that could peel Instagram and WhatsApp off Meta. Trump cares little about the actual purpose of antitrust enforcement: making companies compete for customers with good products. All the pending litigation is just leverage for Trump to punish anyone who doesn\u2019t fall in line. And Silicon Valley is more disinterested in consumers than ever. \u201cGet out of jail free\u201d is a pretty famous card in the game of Monopoly, after all.\nImage: Mark Harris for The Verge\nPerhaps nobody has spent more to buy a break from public scrutiny than the crypto industry. \u201cThe crypto guys are just blowing it out,\u201d an anonymous Trump advisor told Axios. \u201cIt used to be $1 million was a big number. Now we\u2019re looking at some folks giving like $10 [million] or $20 million.\u201d They want a friendly Securities and Exchange Commission. Venture capitalist and PayPal Mafioso David Sacks has already been named as a \u201ccrypto czar.\u201d And there\u2019s a pending executive order to name crypto \u201ca national imperative or priority \u2014 strategic wording intended to guide government agencies to work with the industry,\u201d according to Bloomberg. We may even be about to witness our very first presidential meme coin pump-and-dump.\nCrypto is good for little besides crime and gambling, and less regulation means more chances for people to get scammed by the next FTX. (Speaking of gambling, Robinhood donated $2 million to the Trump inaugural fund.) On top of that, the executive order means a higher likelihood of crypto getting shoveled into new government projects \u2014 whether it\u2019s useful or not. Crypto capture could even extend to soft-pedaling enforcement of the assorted criminal industries that rely on it.\nThen there\u2019s the taxes, of course. The billionaires don\u2019t want to pay them, and Trump is amenable to that. Scott Bessent, nominated for Treasury Secretary, said \u201cthe most important economic issue of the day\u201d was making sure tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy stayed in place. Bessent is accused of being a tax dodge himself.\nMass privatization could make things even more profitable for the tech industry\nBut that\u2019s all small potatoes. The real money is in the military. The venture capitalist Marc Andreessen \u2014 also a board member of Meta and major investor in X \u2014 has been recruiting Trump administration staffers and even influencing Defense Department and intelligence agency hiring, The Washington Post reports. As usual, he\u2019s given the game away by bragging about it on a podcast.\nSilicon Valley investors generally have been bullish on defense tech like industry poster children Anduril and Palantir. (a16z is a major Anduril backer, and both companies are founded and owned by some of the Valley\u2019s earliest MAGA faithful.) They want to shift Pentagon spending away from old-school contractors like Lockheed Martin, which appears to be so freaked out that when the \u201cBig Tech Alert\u201d X account noted it had unfollowed Musk, the Lockheed account DM\u2019d to say it was \u201cinadvertent.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s SpaceX has a number of contracts with the US military and intelligence agencies, including the so-called Starshield satellites. He\u2019s used his influence to meddle in the war between Russia and Ukraine, and has even reportedly taken phone calls from Vladimir Putin. The military\u2019s interest in artificial intelligence has also inspired a new race for everything from building out data centers to providing cloud computing. Musk\u2019s xAI, something of an also-ran next to OpenAI, Meta, and Google, could legitimize itself with DoD contracts.\nThis isn\u2019t a friendly clown car all these men have packed themselves into\nThe AI goldrush likely also interests Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon \u2014 as well as an array of startups. As early as 2017, OpenAI cofounder Greg Brockman wrote to Elon Musk that the company should aim for a \u201cGovernment project (when: ??).\u201d (I\u2019ve heard rumors that OpenAI asked for government funding around then; Microsoft also reportedly pitched DALL-E to the military in 2023.) Microsoft has the most to lose in these negotiations \u2014 Senators Ron Wyden and Eric Schmitt have expressed concerns that the Defense Department is too dependent on it as a vendor. CEO Satya Nadella has already made a pilgrimage to Mar-A-Lago to grovel before Trump and Musk.\nImage: Mark Harris for The Verge\nMass privatization could make things even more profitable for the tech industry. Data/research stuff is an obvious bonanza, but Musk\u2019s criticisms of the F-35 program suggest much broader targeting. Greater military investment in drones, for instance, would likely benefit Anduril. Musk already makes rockets, which means it\u2019s a short leap for SpaceX to make missiles. And should the Trump administration carry out its mass deportation threats, there will doubtless be demand for more databases, mass tracking, and detention centers.\nIf we know anything from Trump\u2019s first term, it\u2019s that he loves people jockeying for his favor. Sure, that means mess, but it also means funny bedfellows. For instance, everyone hates the EU\u2019s regulatory regime. It\u2019s easy to imagine Zuckerberg, Musk, and Cook teaming up to get Trump to defang the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act \u2014 and then immediately turning on each other. Being in Trump\u2019s good graces is a zero sum game, and the prize is that the clown car is eventually going to go right over a cliff.\nSelective legal enforcement puts every company under a sword of Damocles\nI suppose I have to explain why this makes the US a shittier place to live, given the \u201csavvy\u201d cynicism I\u2019ve seen about how it\u2019s all rotten here already. Tech companies, padding their bottom lines, have made their experiences worse, a phenomenon so widespread and well-recognized that now there\u2019s slang for it. Whether the scandals are scams, child predation, worker exploitation, or violations of user privacy \u2014 pick your poison \u2014 Trump has offered tech a way to buy itself out of consequences. That makes life tangibly worse for everyone who isn\u2019t a billionaire.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI's agent tool may be nearing release\ndescription2:\nOpenAI may be close to releasing an AI tool that can take control of your PC and perform actions on your behalf.\nTibor Blaho, a software engineer with a reputation for accurately leaking upcoming AI products, claims to have uncovered evidence of OpenAI\u2019s long-rumored Operator tool. Publications including Bloomberg have previously reported on Operator, which is said to be an \u201cagentic\u201d system capable of autonomously handling tasks like writing code and booking travel.\nAccording to The Information, OpenAI is targeting January as Operator\u2019s release month. Code uncovered by Blaho this weekend adds credence to that reporting.\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT client for macOS has gained options, hidden for now, to define shortcuts to \u201cToggle Operator\u201d and \u201cForce Quit Operator,\u201d per Blaho. And OpenAI has added references to Operator on its website, Blaho said \u2014 albeit references that aren\u2019t yet publicly visible.\nAccording to Blaho, OpenAI\u2019s site also contains not-yet-public tables comparing the performance of Operator to other computer-using AI systems. The tables may well be placeholders. But if the numbers are accurate, they suggest that Operator isn\u2019t 100% reliable, depending on the task.\nOn OSWorld, a benchmark that tries to mimic a real computer environment, \u201cOpenAI Computer Use Agent (CUA)\u201d \u2014 possibly the AI model powering Operator \u2014 scores 38.1%, ahead of Anthropic\u2019s computer-controlling model but well short of the 72.4% humans score. OpenAI CUA surpasses human performance on WebVoyager, which evaluates an AI\u2019s ability to navigate and interact with websites. But the model falls short of human-level scores on another web-based benchmark, WebArena, according to the leaked benchmarks.\nOperator also struggles with tasks a human could perform easily, if the leak is to be believed. In a test that tasked Operator with signing up with a cloud provider and launching a virtual machine, Operator was only successful 60% of the time. Tasked with creating a Bitcoin wallet, Operator succeeded only 10% of the time.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI for comment and will update this piece if we hear back.\nOpenAI\u2019s imminent entry into the AI agent space comes as rivals including the aforementioned Anthropic, Google, and others make plays for the nascent segment. AI agents may be risky and speculative, but tech giants are already touting them as the next big thing in AI. According to analytics firm Markets and Markets, the market for AI agents could be worth $47.1 billion by 2030.\nAgents today are rather primitive. But some experts have raised concerns about their safety, should the technology rapidly improve.\nOne of the leaked charts shows Operator performing well on selected safety evaluations, including tests that try to get the system to perform \u201cillicit activities\u201d and search for \u201csensitive personal data.\u201d Reportedly, safety testing is among the reasons for Operator\u2019s long development cycle. In a recent X post, OpenAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba criticized Anthropic for releasing an agent he claims lacks safety mitigations.\n\u201cI can only imagine the negative reactions if OpenAI made a similar release,\u201d Zaremba wrote.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that OpenAI has been criticized by AI researchers, including ex-staff, for allegedly de-emphasizing safety work in favor of quickly productizing its technology.\n\ntitle3:\nUS safety regulators expand Ford hands-free driving tech investigation\ndescription3:\nA U.S. federal safety regulator has \u201cupgraded\u201d its investigation into Ford\u2019s hands-free advanced driver assistance system known as BlueCruise \u2014 a required step before a recall can be issued.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\u2019s Office of Defects Investigation launched a probe into Ford BlueCruise last April after the agency confirmed the system was active in Ford Mustang Mach E vehicles involved in two fatal crashes. In both instances, the Mustang Mach E cars hit stationary vehicles.\nNHTSA issued a notice this week that it has upgraded the investigation to an engineering analysis. This means the agency will dig deeper into BlueCruise and its potential limitations, which includes vehicle evaluations, reviewing additional technical information, and performing additional analysis of related crashes and non-crash reports.\nAn estimated 129,222 Ford Mustang Mach E vehicles are equipped with BlueCruise, according to the regulator. A Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the automaker is working with NHTSA to support its investigation.\nThe agency said its initial investigation found BlueCruise has limitations in the \u201cdetection of stationary vehicles in certain conditions.\u201d Those limitations include the potential to falsely detect stationary objects at long distances when the Ford vehicle is traveling at or above 62 miles per hour.\n\u201cAdditionally, system performance may be limited when there is poor visibility due to insufficient illumination,\u201d NHTSA said.\nFord debuted BlueCruise in 2021 on the 2021 F-150 pickup truck and certain 2021 Mustang Mach-E models. The hands-free feature uses cameras, radar sensors, and software to provide a combination of adaptive cruise control, lane centering, and speed-sign recognition. BlueCruise and competitor GM\u2019s Super Cruise systems are both hands-free, although an in-cabin camera monitors drivers to ensure their eyes are on the road.\nThese systems are considered competitors to Tesla Autopilot, which still requires the driver\u2019s hands to remain on the wheel. Autopilot and the upgraded Tesla Full Self-Driving software are still considered less constrained than Ford BlueCruise, which only works on certain pre-mapped highways.\nLast October, NHTSA also opened an investigation into Tesla\u2019s so-called \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised)\u201d software after four reported crashes in low-visibility situations \u2014 including one where a pedestrian was killed. That investigation is ongoing.\nThis article was updated to include a comment from Ford.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta confirms it will keep fact-checkers outside the U.S. 'for now'\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nMeta says it plans to keep its fact-checking program in place outside the U.S. for the time being, though it could eventually expand it elsewhere.\nMeta had put the fact-checking guardrails in place over several years in response to criticism over how its platform was used to spread misinformation. With a new administration entering the White House, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram announced earlier this month it would replace its fact-checkers with a community notes system, similar to what\u2019s in place at Elon Musk\u2019s X.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how that goes as we move it out over the year,\u201d Meta\u2019s head of global business Nicola Mendelsohn (pictured above) told Bloomberg in a report from Davos on Monday. \u201cSo nothing changing in the rest of the world at the moment, we are still working with those fact checkers around the world.\u201d\nThe company may face hurdles implementing its new program elsewhere in the world, particularly in Europe, which has regulations such as the Digital Services Act (DSA) in place to curb the spread of deceptive content.\nArticle updated Mendelsohn\u2019s quote to say \u201cyear\u201d rather than \u201cyears\u201d.\"\n\nResponse:",
