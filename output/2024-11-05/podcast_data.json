Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday November 6), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nNvidia just became the world's largest company amid AI boom\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nNvidia on Tuesday exceeded Apple\u2019s market capitalization to become the world\u2019s largest company, on the strength of a global AI push. As Bloomberg notes, the chipmaker has experienced an astronomical 850% growth since the tail end of 2022.\nNvidia was valued at $3.43 trillion at the close of market, topping Apple\u2019s $3.38 trillion. This isn\u2019t the first time the two have swapped places; Nvidia also pushed past Apple in June, though it only held the top spot for a day.\nApple recently launched its own small model generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence. Nvidia, on the other hand, remains a foundational piece of the world\u2019s top large language models \u2014 for now. At the end of October, Reuters reported that ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been working with Broadcom on its own proprietary systems.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon gets FAA approval for new drone as it starts tests in Arizona\ndescription1:\nAmazon said Tuesday it received regulatory approval to begin flying a smaller, quieter version of its delivery drone, the latest step in its long-running efforts to get the futuristic program off the ground.\nThe company unveiled the new drone, called the MK30, in November 2022. It said then that the MK30, in addition to the other changes, would fly through light rain and have twice the range of earlier models.\nAmazon said the Federal Aviation Administration's approval includes permission to fly the MK30 over longer distances and beyond the visual line of sight of pilots. The agency granted a similar waiver for Amazon's Prime Air program in May, though that was limited to flights in College Station, Texas, one of the cities where it has been conducting tests.\nAlongside the FAA approval, Matt McCardle, head of regulatory affairs for Prime Air, said the company is starting to make drone deliveries Tuesday near Phoenix, Arizona. In April, Amazon said it planned to spin up drone operations in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, after it shut down an earlier test site in Lockeford, California. The company will dispatch the drones near one of its warehouses in Tolleson as it looks to integrate Prime Air more closely into its existing logistics network and further speed up deliveries.\nAn FAA spokesperson said the agency granted Amazon permission to conduct beyond visual line of sight deliveries in Tolleson on Oct. 31.\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos first unveiled plans for the ambitious service more than a decade ago, remarking at the time that the program could be up and running within five years. Despite Amazon investing billions of dollars into the program, progress has been slow.\nPrime Air encountered regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and had layoffs last year, coinciding with widespread cost-cutting efforts by CEO Andy Jassy. The program also lost some key executives, including its primary liaison with the FAA and its founding leader. Amazon hired former Boeing executive David Carbon to run the operation.\nIt has also encountered pushback from some residents in the cities where it is trialing drone deliveries. Residents in College Station complained about the noise levels enough that it prompted the city's mayor to mention the concerns in a letter to the FAA, CNBC previously reported. In response, Amazon executives told residents the company would identify a new drone delivery launch site by October 2025.\nAmazon is not the only company trying to crack delivery by drone. It is competing with Wing, owned by Google parent Alphabet ; UPS ; Walmart ; and a host of startups including Zipline and Matternet.\n\ntitle2:\nCryptocurrencies rise as investors brace for election results\ndescription2:\nStocks tied to the price of the cryptocurrency got a boost. Exchange operator Coinbase and MicroStrategy , which often trades as a high beta play on the price of bitcoin, advanced 4% and 2%, respectively.\nThe token tied to Solana gained more than 5%, while payments token XRP rose more than 1%. Memecoins jumped, with dogecoin and Shiba Inu coin soaring 7% and 4%, respectively. Ether was little changed at $2,429.24.\nBitcoin was last higher by nearly 3% at $69,469.37, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $70,522.84. It is currently 5% off its all-time high, after trading within spitting distance of it last week .\nCryptocurrencies were in the green on Tuesday, with bitcoin briefly topping $70,000 as investors looked forward to results from the U.S. presidential election.\nThe race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump for the next presidency has been called the most important election in the crypto industry's lifetime. Many view a Harris win as a threat to crypto, the extent to which has been debated throughout this election cycle. Trump, on the other hand, is seen by many as a force for good in the industry after he presented himself earlier this year as the pro-crypto candidate and has been courting the industry more directly than Harris has.\nRegardless of the eventual winner, bitcoin will likely survive and thrive, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani.\n\"Bitcoin remains the most resilient within crypto to election outcome,\" he said. \"Bitcoin's primary drivers remain U.S. fiscal indiscipline, record debt levels and monetary expansion, driving up demand for hard assets such as gold and bitcoin. We believe bitcoin, being less than 0.1% of global financial assets, has enough headroom for growth regardless of election outcome.\"\nChhugani has a $200,000 price target for bitcoin in 2025, though he said bitcoin could fall to $50,000 in the weeks ahead in the event of a Harris win. He also expects a short-term rally to as high as $90,000 this year in the event of a Trump victory.\nSuccess around bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which have seen more than $23 billion in inflows this year and have $67 billion in assets under management, will continue to accelerate the cryptocurrency's journey, Chhugani added.\nBut it is the broader market of cryptocurrencies that could have more to risk from this election.\n\"A constructive crypto friendly SEC would open opportunity for all crypto assets beyond bitcoin,\" he said. \"The key remains a bipartisan support for crypto regulations (the House and Senate outcome matter as well). And \u2026 if either side pushes towards a crypto friendly SEC. The Trump side has promised a crypto friendly SEC, while the Harris side has promised to defend ownership of crypto assets, although the crypto community would have preferred more specific crypto policy from Harris.\"\nIncreasingly, there has been growing consensus that although Trump could be the more favorable of the two candidates for crypto broadly, a Harris presidency may not be as detrimental as once feared. That fear stems from the hostility crypto experienced under the current administration. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission agency under Gary Gensler has become notorious for its refusal to provide clear guidance for crypto businesses keen to operate by the rules, instead opting to regulate by enforcement actions. In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been vocal about her anticrypto cause.\n\ntitle3:\nApple warns investors its new products might never be as profitable as the iPhone\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nApple is warning investors that its new and future products might never be as profitable as the iPhone. The disclosure comes as the company is pursuing newer technologies like artificial intelligence and mixed-reality headsets.\nApple added the warning in its latest annual report under the \u201cbusiness risks\u201d section, as first reported by the Financial Times.\n\u201cNew products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\u201d Apple wrote in the report.\nThe company has been working to implement consumer AI features in its products to compete with rivals like Google and Meta. Apple\u2019s initial Apple Intelligence features launched last week, and the company has promised additional features, such as a ChatGPT integration, in the coming months.\nAs for Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, the device has seen limited sales, likely due to its hefty $3,499 price tag.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI hires Meta's former Orion head to lead its robotics efforts\ndescription4:\nThe former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses initiative has joined OpenAI to lead the startup's robotics and consumer hardware efforts.\nCaitlin \"CK\" Kalinowski announced her new role Monday in a post on LinkedIn and X, writing, \"In my new role, I will initially focus on OpenAI's robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world and unlock its benefits for humanity.\"\nOpenAI has gained popularity for its viral chatbot, ChatGPT, but the hiring underscores its apparent efforts to move into building and selling hardware. Former Apple exec Jony Ive, who helped design some of Apple's most iconic products from the iMac to the iPhone, has also partnered with OpenAI to create an AI device.\nThe announcement came the same day as that of OpenAI's investment into Physical Intelligence, a robot startup based in San Francisco, which raised $400 million at a $2.4 billion post-money valuation. Other investors included Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Thrive Capital, Lux Capital and Bond Capital.\nThe startup focuses on \"bringing general-purpose AI into the physical world,\" per its website, and it aims to do this by developing large-scale artificial intelligence models and algorithms to power robots.\nBefore the new role at OpenAI, Kalinowski was a hardware executive at Meta for nearly two and a half years leading the company's creation of Orion, previously codenamed Project Nazare, which it billed as \"the most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made.\" Meta unveiled its prototype glasses in September.\nBefore leading the Orion project, Kalinowski worked for more than nine years on virtual reality headsets at Meta-owned Oculus, and before that, nearly six years at Apple helping to design MacBooks, including Pro and Air models.\nKalinowski's first day on the job at OpenAI is Tuesday, Nov. 5, per a LinkedIn post.\"\n\nResponse:",
