Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday November 21), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nDOJ: Google must sell Chrome to end monopoly\ndescription0:\nMaxwell Zeff is a senior reporter at TechCrunch specializing in AI and emerging technologies. Previously with Gizmodo, Bloomberg, and MSNBC, Zeff has covered the rise of AI and the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. He is based in San Francisco. When not reporting, he can be found hiking, biking, and exploring the Bay Area\u2019s food scene.\n\ntitle1:\nBusiness spending on AI surged 500% this year to $13.8 billion, says Menlo Ventures\ndescription1:\nBusiness spending on generative AI surged 500% this year, from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion, according to data released by Menlo Ventures on Wednesday.\nThe report also found that OpenAI ceded market share in enterprise AI, declining from 50% to 34%. Anthropic doubled its market share from 12% to 24%. The results came from a survey of 600 enterprise IT decision-makers from companies with 50 or more employees, per the report.\nMenlo is an investor in Anthropic. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTim Tully, a partner at Menlo Ventures, told CNBC in an interview that the power shift is thanks in part to the advancement of Claude 3.5 and because the majority of companies are using three or more large AI models. Although OpenAI and Anthropic dominated companies' AI model use, he said, people are \"juggling models\" and that habit is \"not a well-understood piece of data.\"\n\"Developers are pretty savvy \u2014 they know how to go back and forth between models fairly quickly,\" Tully explained. \"They're choosing the model that fits their use case best... and that's likely Claude 3.5.\"\nMeta 's market share stayed at 16% and Cohere's share remained at 3%. Google's rose from 7% to 12%, and Mistral's lost one percentage point, declining to 5% in 2024.\nFoundation models \u2014 such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude and others \u2014 still dominated enterprise spend, the report found, with large language models receiving $6.5 billion in enterprise investment.\nMenlo's report was bullish on AI agents, a leading AI trend and area of investment in 2024. Google , Microsoft , Amazon , OpenAI and Anthropic are pursuing the technology. AI agents are viewed as a step beyond chatbots. They can perform multistep, complex tasks on a user's behalf, and generate their own to-do lists, so that users don't have to walk them through the process step-by-step.\n\"The agent stuff is real \u2014 it's not hype,\" Tully told CNBC. \"I don't think it's going to cure cancer, necessarily, but is it going to make people more productive and help companies generate revenue? Yes.\"\nThe report found code generation is the leading use case for generative AI, with more than half of survey responses naming that as a dominant use. Support chatbots came next, at 31%, followed by enterprise search and retrieval, data extraction and transformation, and meeting summarization.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia's CEO defends his moat as AI labs change how they improve their AI models\ndescription2:\nNvidia raked in more than $19 billion in net income during the last quarter, the company reported on Wednesday, but that did little to assure investors that its rapid growth would continue. On its earnings call, analysts prodded CEO Jensen Huang about how Nvidia would fare if tech companies start using new methods to improve their AI models.\nThe method that underpins OpenAI\u2019s o1 model, or \u201ctest-time scaling,\u201d came up quite a lot. It\u2019s the idea that AI models will give better answers if you give them more time and computing power to \u201cthink\u201d through questions. Specifically, it adds more compute to the AI inference phase, which is everything that happens after a user hits enter on their prompt.\nNvidia\u2019s CEO was asked whether he was seeing AI model developers shift over to these new methods and how Nvidia\u2019s older chips would work for AI inference.\nHuang indicated that o1, and test-time scaling more broadly, could play a larger role in Nvidia\u2019s business moving forward, calling it \u201cone of the most exciting developments\u201d and \u201ca new scaling law.\u201d Huang did his best to ensure investors that Nvidia is well-positioned for the change.\nThe Nvidia CEO\u2019s remarks aligned with what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said onstage at a Microsoft event on Tuesday: o1 represents a new way for the AI industry to improve its models.\nThis is a big deal for the chip industry because it places a greater emphasis on AI inference. While Nvidia\u2019s chips are the gold standard for training AI models, there\u2019s a broad set of well-funded startups creating lightning-fast AI inference chips, such as Groq and Cerebras. It could be a more competitive space for Nvidia to operate in.\nDespite recent reports that improvements in generative models are slowing, Huang told analysts that AI model developers are still improving their models by adding more compute and data during the pretraining phase.\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei also said on Wednesday during an onstage interview at the Cerebral Valley summit in San Francisco that he is not seeing a slowdown in model development.\n\u201cFoundation model pretraining scaling is intact and it\u2019s continuing,\u201d said Huang on Wednesday. \u201cAs you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law, but the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we\u2019re learning, however, is that it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\nThat\u2019s certainly what Nvidia investors wanted to hear, since the chipmaker\u2019s stock has soared more than 180% in 2024 by selling the AI chips that OpenAI, Google, and Meta train their models on. However, Andreessen Horowitz partners and several other AI executives have previously said that these methods are already starting to show diminishing returns.\nHuang noted that most of Nvidia\u2019s computing workloads today are around the pretraining of AI models \u2014 not inference \u2014 but he attributed that more to where the AI world is today. He said that one day there will simply be more people running AI models, meaning more AI inference will happen. Huang noted that Nvidia is the largest inference platform in the world today and the company\u2019s scale and reliability gives it a huge advantage compared to startups.\n\u201cOur hopes and dreams are that someday, the world does a ton of inference, and that\u2019s when AI has really succeeded,\u201d said Huang. \u201cEverybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and Nvidia\u2019s architecture, they can innovate more quickly, and they know that everything should work.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI accidentally deleted potential evidence in NY Times copyright lawsuit\ndescription3:\nLawyers for The New York Times and Daily News, which are suing OpenAI for allegedly scraping their works to train its AI models without permission, say OpenAI engineers accidentally deleted data potentially relevant to the case.\nEarlier this fall, OpenAI agreed to provide two virtual machines so that counsel for The Times and Daily News could perform searches for their copyrighted content in its AI training sets. (Virtual machines are software-based computers that exist within another computer\u2019s operating system, often used for the purposes of testing, backing up data, and running apps.) In a letter, attorneys for the publishers say that they and experts they hired have spent over 150 hours since November 1 searching OpenAI\u2019s training data.\nBut on November 14, OpenAI engineers erased all the publishers\u2019 search data stored on one of the virtual machines, according to the aforementioned letter, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York late Wednesday.\nOpenAI tried to recover the data \u2014 and was mostly successful. However, because the folder structure and file names were \u201cirretrievably\u201d lost, the recovered data \u201ccannot be used to determine where the news plaintiffs\u2019 copied articles were used to build [OpenAI\u2019s] models,\u201d per the letter.\n\u201cNews plaintiffs have been forced to recreate their work from scratch using significant person-hours and computer processing time,\u201d counsel for The Times and Daily News wrote. \u201cThe news plaintiffs learned only yesterday that the recovered data is unusable and that an entire week\u2019s worth of its experts\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 work must be re-done, which is why this supplemental letter is being filed today.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 counsel makes clear that they have no reason to believe the deletion was intentional. But they do say the incident underscores that OpenAI \u201cis in the best position to search its own datasets\u201d for potentially infringing content using its own tools.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI for comment and will update this piece if we hear back.\nIn this case and others, OpenAI has maintained that training models using publicly available data \u2014 including articles from The Times and Daily News \u2014 is fair use. In other words, in creating models like GPT-4o, which \u201clearn\u201d from billions of examples of ebooks, essays, and more to generate human-sounding text, OpenAI believes that it isn\u2019t required to license or otherwise pay for the examples \u2014 even if it makes money from those models.\nThat being said, OpenAI has inked licensing deals with a growing number of new publishers, including The Associated Press, Business Insider owner Axel Springer, Financial Times, People parent company Dotdash Meredith, and News Corp. OpenAI has declined to make the terms of these deals public, but one content partner, Dotdash, is reportedly being paid at least $16 million per year.\nOpenAI has neither confirmed nor denied that it trained its AI systems on any specific copyrighted works without permission.\n\ntitle4:\nFTX co-founder Gary Wang avoids prison time for role in crypto fraud\ndescription4:\nGary Wang, a former executive of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, who testified against founder Sam Bankman-Fried, attends his sentencing on fraud charges at the United States District Court in Manhattan in New York City, U.S., November 20, 2024.\nGary Wang, co-founder and ex-technology chief of FTX, was sentenced Wednesday to time served and three years of supervised release on each of the four counts he pled guilty to, becoming the fifth and final ex-employee of the collapsed crypto exchange to be punished. Wang was also ordered to forfeit $11 billion, the same as the other co-defendants.\nWang, who took the stand in the trial against his former boss Sam Bankman-Fried, faced a maximum sentence of 50 years for the four criminal counts he pleaded guilty to, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.\nAfter FTX's former engineering chief Nishad Singh successfully avoided prison time when he was sentenced by Judge Lewis Kaplan last month, Wang was seeking the same sentence citing his nearly immediate cooperation with the government.\nWhen given the opportunity to address the court, Wang said he was deeply sorry to all the customers and investors in FTX.\n\"I took the easy path, the cowardly path, instead of doing the right thing,\" Wang said in a short address to the court, as he clutched a single printed piece of paper that he never referenced from the podium.\n\"I will spend the rest of my life trying to make amends,\" he added.\nWang's parents, as well as his wife, who is expecting their first child, were in court to support him.\nAttorneys for Wang say he didn't have full visibility on the crimes, unlike the other cooperating witnesses, and didn't know that FTX's sister hedge fund Alameda Research was taking customer money until after the scheme was underway.\nThe government was also seeking leniency for Wang.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos described Wang as the easiest cooperating witness he had ever worked with, and he credited Wang for essentially deciphering half of the case for the Government by meticulously unpacking the complicated code used by FTX that allowed for the customer money to be taken off the exchange.\nIn the sentencing submission, prosecutors added that since testifying against the former FTX CEO, Wang has \"put his extraordinary computer programing skills to use in detecting potential fraud in the stock and cryptocurrency markets,\" and has built an interface that the government has started using for detecting potential fraud by publicly traded companies.\nIn addition, \"Wang has also been working on a tool for detection of potential illegal activity in cryptocurrency markets, which in the event Wang is sentenced to a period of time served, the Government understands he will complete as part of his ongoing cooperation.\"\nRoos also noted that Wang was the first FTX employee to walk through the government's door but the last to be sentenced, as the FTX criminal proceedings come to a close.\nIn March, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to pay $11 billion \u2014 the harshest punishment from Judge Kaplan.\nAlameda's ex-CEO Caroline Ellison, who was the star witness in Bankman-Fried's prosecution and his ex-girlfriend, was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the crime. And Ryan Salame, another former top lieutenant of Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison in May \u2014 beyond the upper limit recommended by prosecutors.\nAll FTX former executives have faced sentencing before Judge Kaplan. The no-nonsense 78-year-old judge is a veteran of the Southern District of New York and has presided over some of the biggest cases to roll through the courthouse at 500 Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan.\n\"I've never seen anything quite like what happened here,\" Kaplan said of Wang's cooperation. \"You're entitled to a lot of credit.\"\"\n\nResponse:",
