Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday January 29), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\n'Imperative' to avoid using\ndescription0:\nThe U.S. Navy has instructed its members to avoid using artificial intelligence technology from China's DeepSeek, CNBC has learned.\nIn a warning issued by email to \"shipmates\" on Friday, the Navy said DeepSeek's AI was not to be used \"in any capacity\" due to \"potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model's origin and usage.\"\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Navy confirmed the authenticity of the email and said it was in reference to the Department of the Navy's Chief Information Officer's generative AI policy.\nThe announcement followed DeepSeek's release of its powerful new reasoning AI model called R1, which rivals technology from OpenAI. The DeepSeek model is open source, meaning any AI developer can use it. The DeepSeek app has surged to the top of Apple's App Store, dethroning OpenAI's ChatGPT, and people in the industry have praised its performance and reasoning capabilities.\nDeepSeek's pronouncements rocked the capital markets on Monday due to concerns that future AI products will require less-expensive infrastructure than Wall Street has assumed. DeepSeek said in late December that its large language model took only two months and less than $6 million to build despite the U.S. curbing chip exports to China three times in three years. That's a tiny fraction of the amount spent by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google and others.\nShares of AI chipmakers Nvidia and Broadcom each dropped 17% on Monday, a route that wiped out a combined $800 billion in market cap. Those stocks led a 3.1% drop in the Nasdaq.\nThe Navy's warning landed days earlier.\n\"We would like to bring to your attention a critical update regarding a new AI model called DeepSeek,\" the email said. The memo said it's \"imperative\" that team members do not use DeepSeek's AI \"for any work-related tasks or personal use.\"\nThe email was sent on Friday morning to the distribution list OpNav, which stands for Operational Navy, indicating it was an all-hands memo. The warning was based on an advisory from Naval Air Warcraft Center Division Cyber Workforce Manger.\nIt said recipients were to \"refrain from downloading, installing, or using the DeepSeek model in any capacity.\"\nDeepSeek said on Monday it would temporarily limit user registrations \"due to large-scale malicious attacks\" on its services, before later resuming operations as usual.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia calls China\u2019s DeepSeek R1 model \u2018an excellent AI advancement\u2019\ndescription1:\nJensen Huang, co-founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during a news conference in Taipei, Taiwan, on Tuesday, June 4, 2024. Nvidia is still working on the certification process for Samsung Electronics Co.'s high-bandwidth memory chips, a final required step before the Korean company can begin supplying a component essential to training AI platforms.\nNvidia's statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek's breakthrough as creating more work for the American chipmaker's graphics processing units, or GPUs.\nThe comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1's self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial intelligence models.\n\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.\"\nNvidia called DeepSeek's R1 model \"an excellent AI advancement,\" despite the Chinese startup's emergence causing the chipmaker's stock price to plunge 17% on Monday.\n\"Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,\" the spokesperson added. \"We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"\nNvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang's comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia's GPUs intended for the Chinese market.\nAnalysts are now asking if multibillion-dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply.\nEarlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as part of its AI strategy.\n\"If model training costs prove to be significantly lower, we would expect a near-term cost benefit for advertising, travel, and other consumer app companies that use cloud AI services, while long-term hyperscaler AI-related revenues and costs would likely be lower,\" wrote BofA Securities analyst Justin Post in a note Monday.\nNvidia's comment also reflects a new theme that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have discussed in recent months.\nMuch of the AI boom and the demand for Nvidia GPUs was driven by the \"scaling law,\" a concept in AI development proposed by OpenAI researchers in 2020. That concept suggested that better AI systems could be developed by greatly expanding the amount of computation and data that went into building a new model, requiring more and more chips.\nSince November, Huang and Altman have been focusing on a new wrinkle to the scaling law, which Huang calls \"test-time scaling.\"\nThis concept says that if a fully trained AI model spends more time using extra computer power when making predictions or generating text or images to allow it to \"reason,\" it will provided better answers than it would have if it ran for less time.\nForms of the test-time scaling law are used in some of OpenAI's models such as o1 as well as DeepSeek's breakthrough R1 model.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov for U.S. government agencies\ndescription2:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks next to SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son after U.S. President Donald Trump delivered remarks on AI infrastructure at the Roosevelt room at White House in Washington, U.S., January 21, 2025.\nOpenAI on Tuesday announced its biggest product launch since its enterprise rollout. It's called ChatGPT Gov and was built specifically for U.S. government use.\nThe Microsoft -backed company bills the new platform as a step beyond ChatGPT Enterprise as far as security. It allows government agencies, as customers, to feed \"non-public, sensitive information\" into OpenAI's models while operating within their own secure hosting environments, OpenAI CPO Kevin Weil told reporters during a briefing Monday.\nSince the beginning of 2024, OpenAI said that more than 90,000 employees of federal, state and local governments have generated more than 18 million prompts within ChatGPT, using the tech to translate and summarize documents, write and draft policy memos, generate code, and build applications.\nThe user interface for ChatGPT Gov looks like ChatGPT Enterprise. The main difference is that government agencies will use ChatGPT Gov in their own Microsoft Azure commercial cloud, or Azure Government community cloud, so they can \"manage their own security, privacy and compliance requirements,\" Felipe Millon, who leads federal sales and go-to-market for OpenAI, said on the call with reporters.\nFor as long as artificial intelligence has been used by government agencies, it's faced significant scrutiny due to its potentially harmful ripple effects, especially for vulnerable and minority populations, and data privacy concerns. Police use of AI has led to a number of wrongful arrests and, in California, voters rejected a plan to replace the state's bail system with an algorithm due to concerns it would increase bias.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told CNBC that the company acknowledges there are special considerations for government use of AI, and OpenAI wrote in a blog post Tuesday that the product is subject to its usage policies.\nAaron Wilkowitz, a solutions engineer at OpenAI, showed reporters a demo of a day in the life of a new Trump administration employee, allowing the person to sign into ChatGPT Gov and create a five-week plan for some of their job duties, then analyze an uploaded photo of the same printed-out plan with notes and markings all over it. Wilkowitz also demonstrated how ChatGPT Gov could draft a memo to the legal and compliance department summarizing its own AI-generated job plan and then translate the memo into different languages.\nChatGPT Enterprise, which underpins ChatGPT Gov, is currently going through the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or FedRAMP, and has not yet been accredited for use on nonpublic data. Weil told CNBC it's a \"long process,\" adding that he couldn't provide a timeline.\n\"I know President Trump is also looking at how we can potentially streamline that, because it's one way of getting more modern software tooling into the government and helping the government run more efficiently,\" Weil said. \"So we're very excited about that.\"\nBut OpenAI's Millon said ChatGPT Gov will be available in the \"near future,\" with customers potentially testing and using the product live \"within a month.\" He said he foresees agencies with sensitive data, such as defense, law enforcement and health care, benefiting most from the product.\nWhen asked if the Trump administration played a role in ChatGPT Gov, Weil said he was in Washington, D.C., for the inauguration and \"got to spend a lot of time with folks coming into the new administration.\" He added that \"the focus is on ensuring that the U.S. wins in AI\" and that \"our interests are very aligned.\"\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman attended the inauguration alongside other tech CEOs and has recently joined the growing tide of industry leaders publicly pronouncing their admiration for President Donald Trump or donating to his inauguration fund. Altman wrote on X that watching Trump \"more carefully recently has really changed my perspective on him,\" adding that \"he will be incredible for the country in many ways.\"\nA few days before the inauguration, Altman received a letter from U.S. senators expressing concern that he is attempting to \"cozy up to the incoming Trump administration\" with the aim of avoiding regulation and limiting scrutiny.\nRegarding China's DeepSeek, Weil told reporters the new developments don't change how OpenAI thinks about its product road map but instead \"underscores how important it is that the U.S. wins this race.\"\n\"It's a super competitive industry, and this is showing that it's competitive globally, not just within the U.S.,\" Weil said. \"We're committed to moving really quickly here. We want to stay ahead.\"\n\ntitle3:\nApple fixes zero-day flaw affecting all devices\ndescription3:\nApple released the latest updates for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems on Monday, which included switching on Apple Intelligence by default for newer devices.\nAs part of this batch of software updates, Apple also released several patches fixing security bugs, including a zero-day bug that \u201cmay have been actively exploited\u201d \u2014 meaning hackers were using it to compromise devices \u2014 against users with iPhones running software older than iOS 17.2, which was released in December 2023.\nThe bug was found in Core Media, the media engine that powers a range of Apple devices, and is now fixed across its product line, including iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, Apple Watches, and its mixed-reality headset, Vision Pro. Apple said hackers could have \u201celevated privileges\u201d by exploiting a memory corruption bug, which would have allowed broader access to a device\u2019s data.\nApple did not credit the bug discovery to any researcher, as it customarily \u2014 but not always \u2014 does. A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately comment when asked for more details about who exploited the bug and against whom.\nThis is the first bug found in iOS this year that was exploited in the wild. For reference, Apple fixed at least seven bugs that \u201cmay have been actively exploited\u201d in 2024, according to TechCrunch\u2019s running tally.\n\ntitle4:\nSoftBank to invest $500M in robotics startup SkildAI\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nSoftBank is negotiating a $500 million investment in Skild AI, a software company building a foundational model for robotics at a $4 billion valuation, Bloomberg and Financial Times reported.\nThe two-year-old company raised its previous funding round of $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation last July from investors including Jeff Bezos, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Coatue Management.\nThe company\u2019s AI model can be applied to various types of robots, Skild founders Deepak Pathak and Abhinav Gupta told TechCrunch last July. They said the generalized model can be modified for a specific domain and use case.\nThe intersection of robotics and AI has witnessed substantial investor interest.\nOver the recent year, investors, particularly Bezos, have increased their funding to AI-powered robotics companies.\nPhysical Intelligence, a startup that raised $400 million at a $2 billion pre-money valuation in November, is another startup claiming to be developing \u201cbrains\u201d for a broad range of robots. Jeff Bezos, Lux Capital, and Thrive Capital led that round.\nLast February, Figure AI, a startup building an AI-powered humanoid robot, raised $675 million at a $2.6 billion valuation from Microsoft, OpenAI Startup Fund, Nvidia, Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund, and Jeff Bezos (through Bezos Expeditions).\"\n\nResponse:",
