The companies say they signed a letter of intent to deploy 10 gigawatts \u2014 enough to power millions of homes \u2014 worth of Nvidia systems to power OpenAI\u2019s next generation of AI infrastructure.\nThe deal may help OpenAI as it reduces its reliance on Microsoft, its largest investor and supplier of cloud computing resources. In January, Microsoft announced changes to its partnership with OpenAI, allowing the ChatGPT-maker to build additional AI infrastructure with other partners. Since then, OpenAI has teamed up with various partners on AI data center projects, such as Stargate. Nvidia says the deal will complement existing partnerships OpenAI has, including agreements with Microsoft, Oracle, and SoftBank.\nOpenAI says it will work with Nvidia as a \u201cpreferred strategic compute and networking partner\u201d for its AI factory growth. It\u2019s unclear whether Nvidia\u2019s investment will be paid out in chips, cloud credits, cash, or otherwise.\n\ntitle2:\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now with the US TikTok deal\ndescription2:\nTikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government.\nAs a result, U.S. users have often found themselves caught in the middle of this tension. Earlier this year, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.\nA number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app, and if a deal were to go through, the platform\u2019s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research\u2019s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.\nFollowing extensive discussions and after Trump extended the TikTok ban deadline for the fourth time, it seems that progress has been made. Last week, President Trump announced that President Xi of China had given his approval of a TikTok deal, which would allow a consortium of U.S. investors to control the platform. ByteDance stated publicly that it would ensure the platform remains available to American users.\nWho will take ownership of TikTok in the U.S.?\nRecently, a \u201cframework\u201d deal was reportedly established between the U.S. and China, with new information revealed indicating that a consortium of investors, including Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz, may oversee TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.\nThese investors are expected to hold an 80% stake, and the remaining shares will belong to Chinese stakeholders. The new entity\u2019s board would predominantly consist of U.S. members, with one member appointed by the U.S. government.\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch Image Credits:Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nOver the weekend, Trump mentioned in a Fox interview that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are \u201cprobably\u201d going to play a role, along with Oracle\u2019s executive chairman Larry Ellison and Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOracle is likely to handle the app\u2019s security and safety measures. The company already provides cloud services for TikTok and manages user data in the U.S. Notably, Oracle previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020.\nAdditionally, as part of the proposed arrangement, Oracle would replicate and secure a new U.S. version of the algorithm, according to a White House official. The U.S.-based TikTok owners could lease the algorithm from ByteDance, which Oracle will then retrain.\nByteDance will not have access to information about TikTok\u2019s U.S. users or any influence over the U.S. algorithm.\nWhat users in the U.S. should know\nReports from Bloomberg indicate that when the deal is finalized, the TikTok app will be discontinued in the U.S. and users will need to transition to a new platform. However, the specifics of this platform remain largely unclear, including its features and how it will differ from the original app.\nHow did we get here\nTo fully understand this high-stakes drama, we\u2019ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok\u2019s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.\nThe drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.\nA month later, Trump\u2019s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.\nThings began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. After the Senate passed the bill against TikTok, President Joe Biden signed it.\nIn response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.\nFast forward to today: Trump has had a change of heart since his first term and is trying to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.\nThere have been several contenders, including The People\u2019s Bid for TikTok , a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt. This group has the support of investment firm Guggenheim Securities and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Supporters include Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, TV personality and investor Kevin O\u2019Leary, inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee, and senior research scientist David Clark.\nREDWOOD CITY, CA \u2013 DECEMBER 16: The Oracle logo is displayed on the exterior of the Oracle headquarters on December 16, 2014 in Redwood City, California. Oracle will report second quarter earnings on Wednesday.

On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade \u2013 with much of that money coming from AI companies themselves. Along the way, they\u2019re placing immense strain on power grids, and pushing the industry\u2019s building capacity to its limit.\nBelow, we\u2019ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We\u2019ll keep it updated as the boom continues, and the numbers climb even higher.\nMicrosoft\u2019s $1 billion investment in OpenAI\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: in 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI \u2013 and as the demands of model-training became more intense, more of Microsoft\u2019s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash. It was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion \u2013 a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft\u2019s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn\u2019t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\nOpenAI\u2019s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it\u2019s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company\u2019s hardware to make it better-suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Loveable and Windsurf as \u201cprimary computing partners,\u201d although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company\u2019s GPUs.\nThe rise of Oracle\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nOn June 30th 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner, more than the company\u2019s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of the OpenAI\u2019s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company\u2019s stock went shooting up.\nA few months later, it happened again. On September 10th, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle\u2019s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith. But before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers \u2013 and a financial force to be reckoned with.\nBuilding tomorrow\u2019s hyperscale data centers\nFor companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated \u2013 although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on US infrastructure through the end of 2028. In just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company\u2019s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers. A new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.\nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county\u2019s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.\nThe Stargate moonshot\nJust two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named \u201cStargate\u201d after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it \u201cthe largest AI infrastructure project in history. Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, \u200b\u200b\u201dI think this will be the most important project of this era.\u201d\nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman\u2019s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\n\ntitle4:\nFacebook is getting an AI dating assistant\ndescription4:\nMeta announced on Monday that it\u2019s bringing an AI assistant to Facebook Dating.\nThis chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find \u201ca Brooklyn girl in tech\u201d or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile.\nMeta also says that it\u2019s \u201chelping people avoid swipe fatigue\u201d with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly \u201csurprise match\u201d chosen based on its algorithm.\nThe company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year growth, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That\u2019s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about 50 million daily active users, and Hinge\u2019s 10 million daily active users.\nAI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like Sitch have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features.\nMatch Group \u2014 the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others \u2014 entered a partnership with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant\u2019s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That\u2019s a big bet, especially given the financial struggles of Match Group, which has lost about 68% of its stock price in the last five years.\nSo far, this investment has produced features like an AI photo selector tool to Tinder, which scans your cameral roll to help choose profile images, as well as AI-powered matching. Hinge has a feature that lets users improve their responses to profile prompts with AI.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
