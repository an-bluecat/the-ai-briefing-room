Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The agency also ordered Zuckerman to delete all the data collected by SpyFone, as well as to undergo frequent audits and establish certain cybersecurity practices for his businesses.\n\u201cSpyFone is a brazen brand name for a surveillance business that helped stalkers steal private information,\u201d said Samuel Levine, then acting director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. \u201cThe stalkerware was hidden from device owners, but was fully exposed to hackers who exploited the company\u2019s slipshod security.\u201d\nIn his petition, Zuckerman claimed that the FTC order\u2019s security requirements have made it harder for him to run his other businesses due to financial costs, despite the fact that Support King is no longer in operation and he now only runs a restaurant and plans other \u201ctourism ventures\u201d in Puerto Rico, according to the petition.\nWhen reached via email, Zuckerman declined to comment and referred questions to his lawyer.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe FTC ban stemmed from an incident in 2018, when a security researcher found an Amazon S3 bucket belonging to SpyFone that left extremely sensitive data \u2014 including selfies, text messages, chat app messages, audio recordings, contacts, location, hashed passwords and logins, and more \u2014 exposed online for anyone to see and access.\nThe exposed data included 44,109 unique email addresses and, according to the researcher who found the breach, \u201cat least 2,208 current \u2018customers\u2019 and hundreds or thousands of photos and audio in each folder\u201d from 3,666 phones that had the SpyFone stalkerware installed on them.\nContact Us Do you have more information about stalkerware makers?

From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email .\nLess than a year after the 2021 FTC order, TechCrunch reported that Zuckerman appeared to be running another stalkerware company. In 2022, TechCrunch received a trove of breached data from stalkerware app SpyTrac. The data revealed that SpyTrac was run by freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, in what appeared to be an attempt to circumvent the FTC\u2019s ban. Furthermore, the breached data included records from SpyFone, which Zuckerman was ordered to delete, and keys to access the cloud storage of OneClickMonitor, another one of his stalkerware apps.\nEva Galperin, a prominent expert on stalkerware, celebrated the news. \u201cMr. Zuckerman was clearly hoping that if he laid low for a few years, everyone would forget about the reasons why the FTC issued a ban not only against the company, but against him specifically,\u201d Galperin told TechCrunch.\nTechCrunch\u2019s revelation in 2022 that Zuckerman apparently violated the FTC ban, \u201csuggests that Zuckerman did not learn his lesson,\u201d added Galperin, who is the director of cybersecurity at the digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.\nStalkerware apps allow their customers to surreptitiously spy on the phones and devices of their loved ones. In addition to enabling potentially illegal activities, for the last eight years, there have been at least 26 stalkerware companies that have been hacked or left sensitive data exposed online, according to TechCrunch\u2019s tally. These repeated incidents show these companies have repeatedly failed to protect the privacy of their customers, as well as the people they spy on.\n\ntitle1:\nDepartment of Commerce approves Nvidia H200 chip exports to China\ndescription1:\nAdvanced Nvidia AI chips can head back to China after all.\nThe Department of Commerce will allow Nvidia to ship H200 chips to China, as originally reported by Semafor, to approved customers in the country. The U.S. will take a 25% cut of these sales, CNBC reported.\nH200 chips are much more advanced than the H20 chips Nvidia developed specifically for the Chinese market, but the company would only be able to send H200s that are roughly 18 months old, Semafor reported.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson told TechCrunch of the development: \u201cWe applaud President Trump\u2019s decision to allow America\u2019s chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America. Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\u201d\nThe news report comes a week after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the decision on exporting these H200 chips to China was in President Donald Trump\u2019s hands.\nThe decision to send the chips to China conflicts with Congressional concerns about national security.\nPete Ricketts, a Republican senator from Nebraska, and Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, introduced a bill on December 4 that would block the export of advanced AI chips to China for more than two years.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe Secure and Feasible Exports Act (SAFE) Chips Act would require the Department of Commerce to deny any export license on advanced AI chips to China for 30 months. It\u2019s unclear when legislators will vote on the proposed bill especially now that the Trump administration has given the green light to sell the H200 chips.\nWhile Congress has long been clear about sending advanced AI chips to China \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 President Trump has waffled on whether or not to allow the exports.\nThe Trump administration hit chip companies like Nvidia with licensing requirements to send their chips to China in April before it formally rescinded a Biden administration diffusion rule that would have regulated AI chip exports in May. Over the summer, the U.S. government signaled that companies would be able to start sending chips to China as long as the government got a 15% cut of all revenue, as chips became a bargaining tool in trade talks with China.\nHowever, by that point, the market for U.S.-developed chips in China was strained.\nIn September, China\u2019s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, banned domestic companies from buying Nvidia\u2019s chips, leaving companies in the country to rely on less advanced domestic chips from Alibaba and Huawei.\nOn Monday, Trump said that Chinese president Xi Jinping \u201cresponded positively\u201d to the latest H200 news in a Truth Social post.\nThis story was updated on December 8 when the proposed decision was confirmed.\n\ntitle2:\nSoftBank and Nvidia reportedly in talks to fund Skild AI at $14B, nearly tripling its value\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nSoftBank Group and Nvidia are in talks to lead an investment of over $1 billion at a $14 billion valuation in Skild AI, a software company building a foundational robotics model, Reuters reported.\nThe nearly three-year-old startup was last valued at $4.7 billion in May when it raised $500 million in a round led by SoftBank along with the participation of LG Technology Ventures, Samsung, Nvidia, and others, according to PitchBook data. Skild didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank and Nvidia declined to comment.\nUnlike other heavily funded startups, Skild AI is not building proprietary hardware. Instead, it\u2019s developing a robot-agnostic foundation model that can be customized for various types of robots and use cases.\nThe company unveiled its general-purpose robot model Skild Brain in July with videos showing robots picking up dishes and climbing up and down the stairs. The company has secured strategic partnerships with LG CNS and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to develop its ecosystem.\nInvestor interest in AI robotics has been steadily growing. Physical Intelligence, another company developing \u201cbrains\u201d for a broad range of robots, has reportedly recently raised $600 million at a $5.6 billion valuation led by CapitalG. One investor who evaluated but declined to fund Physical Intelligence told TechCrunch that its model is still in the early stages of development.\nIn September, Figure, a company developing a humanoid robot, raised more than $1 billion at a massive $39 billion valuation. Meanwhile, 1X, another humanoid robot developer, was in talks to secure as much as $1 billion at a $10 billion valuation, The Information reported several months ago.\n\ntitle3:\nIBM to acquire Confluent for $11B as it seeks to bolster its data offerings\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nIBM is buying data infrastructure company Confluent for $11 billion in cash in a bid to bolster its data and automation products as ever more companies move their tech operations to the cloud and deploy AI technology.\nThe tech giant said it would offer $31 for each Confluent share, which is about 50% more than what the smaller company\u2019s shares closed at on Friday, before news of the deal.\nConfluent offers a platform that helps enterprises manage streams of data in real time, a use case that\u2019s exploded in demand as ever more companies develop and deploy AI products, which require significant back-and-forth processing of data for inferencing.\nIBM said Confluent will complement its existing data and automation products, as well as improve upon its existing offerings across AI, automation, data, and consulting. The company expects the deal to add to EBITDA and free cash flow in the two years after the deal is closed.\nThis is the latest in a string of deals IBM has struck in recent months as it seeks to capitalize on the AI boom, though at $11 billion, Confluent would be the tech giant\u2019s largest buy in years, following its acquisition of HashiCorp in 2024.\nIBM in October signed a deal with AI lab Anthropic to deploy the Claude large language model into some of its products; it has partnered with AMD to develop a new computing architecture that combines quantum systems with AI-specialized chips; and it acquired data analysis startup Seek AI in June.\n\ntitle4:\nInvestor letter reveals skyrocketing growth of Waymo's robotaxi rides\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nSix months ago, Waymo disclosed it was providing 250,000 robotaxi rides a week across its service areas, an ever-growing list that includes Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\nThe Alphabet-owned self-driving company has been coy ever since, simply stating it is providing many hundreds of thousands of weekly rides. Now, we have a firmer grasp on those weekly ride numbers, thanks to a leaked letter from Tiger Global Management to it investors that was first reported by CNBC.\nThe letter was an appeal for investment into Tiger Global\u2019s next venture capital fund and called out the gains, so far, of its current fund. Those gains rested largely on its investments in hot companies like OpenAI, Databricks, and Waymo. In the letter, Tiger disclosed that Waymo is now providing 450,000 robotaxi rides per week \u2014 nearly double the amount it disclosed this spring.\nThat number will rise as the company continues its aggressive rollout strategy, too. Waymo, which provides commercial robotaxi service in five cities, has announced plans to launch in 12 additional cities in 2026, including Dallas, Denver, Houston, Nashville, and San Diego.\nA Waymo spokesperson declined to comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
