Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The chipmaker will deliver 750 megawatts of compute to the AI giant starting this year and continuing through the year 2028, Cerebras said.\nThe deal is worth over $10 billion, a source familiar with the details told TechCrunch. Reuters also reported the deal size.\nBoth companies said that the deal is about delivering faster outputs for OpenAI\u2019s customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said these systems would speed responses that currently require more time to process. Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras, said just as \u201cbroadband transformed the internet, real-time inference will transform AI.\u201d\nCerebras has been around for over a decade but its star has risen significantly since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022 and the AI boom that followed. The company claims its systems, built with its chips designed for AI use, are faster than GPU-based systems (such as Nvidia\u2019s offerings).\nCerebras filed for an IPO in 2024 but since then has pushed it back a number of times. In the meantime, the company has continued to raise large amounts of money. On Tuesday, it was reported that the company was in talks to raise another billion dollars at a $22 billion valuation. It\u2019s also worth noting that OpenAI\u2019s CEO, Sam Altman, is already an investor in the company and that OpenAI once considered acquiring it.\n\u201cOpenAI\u2019s compute strategy is to build a resilient portfolio that matches the right systems to the right workloads,\u201d said Sachin Katti of OpenAI in the company\u2019s post. \u201cCerebras adds a dedicated low-latency inference solution to our platform. That means faster responses, more natural interactions, and a stronger foundation to scale real-time AI to many more people.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nMeta to reportedly lay off 10% of Reality Labs staff\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMeta is laying off 10% of staff in its Reality Labs division, which is core to developing the company\u2019s VR and metaverse products, The New York Times reported.\nThe publication noted that Reality Labs had roughly 15,000 employees, and the job cuts could impact over 1,000 people.\nSeparately, CNBC reported that the company plans to shut down studios such as Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, along with a technical unit called Oculus Studios Central Technology, which was working on VR titles. Business Insider reported that the company\u2019s CTO and head of Reality Labs, Andrew Bosworth, called for the \u201cmost important\u201d in-person meeting of the year on January 14.\nThe NYT reported that the job cuts would not impact folks working on augmented reality, as the company has big ambitions to develop glasses and controllers. The report also noted that the money saved from these cuts will be used for AR development.\nThe news comes as Meta, which changed its entire brand to focus on the metaverse in 2021, is pouring its resources into AI development. In October, the company moved metaverse head Vishal Shah to oversee AI products as a vice president, and last year, reorganized to set up its Superintelligence Labs after poaching Alexandr Wang from Scale AI. The company went on to offer top packages to researchers working at other labs to lure them to join Meta.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle2:\nRobotics software maker Skild AI hits $14B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nSkild AI, which makes foundation models for robots, seems to have more than tripled its valuation in just seven months.\nThe startup has raised a $1.4 billion Series C round that values it at more than $14 billion, Bloomberg reported. The round was led by SoftBank, and Nvidia, Macquarie Group, 1789 Capital, and others also invested.\nSkild AI last raised funding at a $4.5 billion valuation this prior summer, Bloomberg reported. The company hasn\u2019t disclosed the exact value of that round \u2014 it was rumored to be around $500 million \u2014 but Skild AI CEO Deepak Pathak told Bloomberg that the company has now raised more than $2 billion to date.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Skild AI for more information on its fundraising history, and we\u2019ll update this piece when we hear more.\nFounded in 2023, Skild AI builds general-purpose robotic software and foundation models that can be retrofitted to a variety of different robots and tasks without requiring a ton of additional training. The hope is that these models can also learn from watching humans perform tasks.\nThere has been a big push recently into this type of learn-as-you-go robotic software alongside the rising hype around humanoids.\nOne of the biggest hurdles in robot adoption for both personal and industrial use cases is the sheer amount of training required for robots to learn each and every new task. Being able to learn and adapt as they go would clear the path for more robotic adoption.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The maker of humanoid Neo, 1X, just released a world model in pursuit of the same goal.\n\ntitle3:\nMusk denies awareness of Grok sexual underage images as California AG launches probe\ndescription3:\nElon Musk said Wednesday he is \u201cnot aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok,\u201d hours before the California attorney general opened an investigation into xAI\u2019s chatbot over the \u201cproliferation of nonconsensual sexually explicit material.\u201d\nMusk\u2019s denial comes as pressure mounts from governments worldwide \u2014 from the U.K. and Europe to Malaysia and Indonesia \u2014 after users on X began asking Grok to turn photos of real women, and in some cases children, into sexualized images without their consent. Copyleaks, an AI detection and content governance platform, estimated roughly one image was posted each minute on X. A separate sample gathered from January 5 to January 6 found 6,700 per hour over the 24-hour period. (X and xAI are part of the same company.)\n\u201cThis material\u2026has been used to harass people across the internet,\u201d said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement. \u201cI urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\u201d\nThe AG\u2019s office will investigate whether and how xAI violated the law.\nSeveral laws exist to protect targets of nonconsensual sexual imagery and child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Last year the Take It Down Act was signed into a federal law, which criminalizes knowingly distributing nonconsensual intimate images \u2014 including deepfakes \u2014 and requires platforms like X to remove such content within 48 hours. California also has its own series of laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2024 to crack down on sexually explicit deepfakes.\nGrok began fulfilling user requests on X to produce sexualized photos of women and children toward the end of the year. The trend appears to have taken off after certain adult-content creators prompted Grok to generate sexualized imagery of themselves as a form of marketing, which then led to other users issuing similar prompts. In a number of public cases, including well-known figures like \u201cStranger Things\u201d actress Millie Bobby Brown, Grok responded to prompts asking it to alter real photos of real women by changing clothing, body positioning, or physical features in overtly sexual ways.\nAccording to some reports, xAI has begun implementing safeguards to address the issue. Grok now requires a premium subscription before responding to certain image-generation requests, and even then the image may not be generated. April Kozen, VP of marketing at Copyleaks, told TechCrunch that Grok may fulfill a request in a more generic or toned-down way. They added that Grok appears more permissive with adult content creators.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cOverall, these behaviors suggest X is experimenting with multiple mechanisms to reduce or control problematic image generation, though inconsistencies remain,\u201d Kozen said.\nNeither xAI nor Musk has publicly addressed the problem head on. A few days after the instances began, Musk appeared to make light of the issue by asking Grok to generate an image of himself in a bikini. On January 3, X\u2019s safety account said the company takes \u201caction against illegal content on X, including [CSAM],\u201d without specifically addressing Grok\u2019s apparent lack of safeguards or the creation of sexualized manipulated imagery involving women.\nThe positioning mirrors what Musk posted today, emphasizing illegality and user behavior.\nMusk wrote he was \u201cnot aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\u201d That statement doesn\u2019t deny the existence of bikini pics or sexualized edits more broadly.\nMichael Goodyear, an associate professor at New York Law School and former litigator, told TechCrunch that Musk likely narrowly focused on CSAM because the penalties for creating or distributing synthetic sexualized imagery of children are greater.\n\u201cFor example, in the United States, the distributor or threatened distributor of CSAM can face up to three years imprisonment under the Take It Down Act, compared to two for nonconsensual adult sexual imagery,\u201d Goodyear said.\nHe added that the \u201cbigger point\u201d is Musk\u2019s attempt to draw attention to problematic user content.\n\u201cObviously, Grok does not spontaneously generate images. It does so only according to user request,\u201d Musk wrote in his post. \u201cWhen asked to generate images, it will refuse to produce anything illegal, as the operating principle for Grok is to obey the laws of any given country or state. There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately.\u201d\nTaken together, the post characterizes these incidents as uncommon, attributes them to user requests or adversarial prompting, and presents them as technical issues that can be solved through fixes. It stops short of acknowledging any shortcomings in Grok\u2019s underlying safety design.\n\u201cRegulators may consider, with attention to free speech protections, requiring proactive measures by AI developers to prevent such content,\u201d Goodyear said.\nTechCrunch has reached out to xAI to ask how many times it caught instances of nonconsensual sexually manipulated images of women and children, what guardrails specifically changed, and whether the company notified regulators of the issue. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.\nThe California AG isn\u2019t the only regulator to try to hold xAI accountable for the issue. Indonesia and Malaysia have both temporarily blocked access to Grok; India has demanded that X make immediate technical and procedural changes to Grok; the European Commission ordered xAI to retain all documents related to its Grok chatbot, a precursor to opening a new investigation; and the U.K.\u2019s online safety watchdog Ofcom opened a formal investigation under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act.\nxAI has come under fire for Grok\u2019s sexualized imagery before. As AG Bonta pointed out in a statement, Grok includes a \u201cspicy mode\u201d to generate explicit content. In October, an update made it even easier to jailbreak what little safety guidelines there were, resulting in many users creating hardcore pornography with Grok, as well as graphic and violent sexual images.\nMany of the more pornographic images that Grok has produced have been of AI-generated people \u2014 something that many might still find ethically dubious but perhaps less harmful to the individuals in the images and videos.\n\u201cWhen AI systems allow the manipulation of real people\u2019s images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal,\u201d Copyleaks co-founder and CEO Alon Yamin said in a statement emailed to TechCrunch. \u201cFrom Sora to Grok, we are seeing a rapid rise in AI capabilities for manipulated media. To that end, detection and governance are needed now more than ever to help prevent misuse.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nAI models are starting to crack high-level math problems\ndescription4:\nOver the weekend, Neel Somani, who is a software engineer, former quant researcher, and a startup founder, was testing the math skills of OpenAI\u2019s new model when he made an unexpected discovery. After pasting the problem into ChatGPT and letting it think for 15 minutes, he came back to a full solution. He evaluated the proof and formalized it with a tool called Harmonic \u2014 but it all checked out.\n\u201cI was curious to establish a baseline for when LLMs are effectively able to solve open math problems compared to where they struggle,\u201d Somani said. The surprise was that, using the latest model, the frontier started to push forward a bit.\nChatGPT\u2019s chain of thought is even more impressive, rattling off mathematical axioms like Legendre\u2019s formula, Bertrand\u2019s postulate, and the Star of David theorum. Eventually, the model found a Math Overflow post from 2013, where Harvard mathematician Noam Elkies had given an elegant solution to a similar problem. But ChatGPT\u2019s final proof differed from Elkies\u2019 work in important ways, and gave a more complete solution to a version of the problem posed by legendary mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s, whose vast collection of unsolved problems has become a proving ground for AI.\nFor anyone skeptical of machine intelligence, it\u2019s a surprising result \u2014 and it\u2019s not the only one. AI tools have become ubiquitous in mathematics, from formalization-oriented LLMs like Harmonic\u2019s Aristotle to literature review tools like OpenAI\u2019s deep research. But since the release of GPT 5.2 \u2014 which Somani describes as \u201canecdotally more skilled at mathematical reasoning than previous iterations\u201d \u2014 the sheer volume of solved problems has become difficult to ignore, raising new questions about large language models\u2019 ability to push the frontiers of human knowledge.\nSomani was looking at the Erd\u0151s problems, a set of over 1,000 conjectures by the Hungarian mathematician that are maintained online. The problems have become a tempting target for AI-driven mathematics, varying significantly in both subject matter and difficulty. The first batch of autonomous solutions came in November from a Gemini-powered model called AlphaEvolve \u2014 but more recently, Somani and others have found GPT 5.2 to be remarkably adept with high-level math.\nSince Christmas, 15 problems have been moved from \u201copen\u201d to \u201csolved\u201d on the Erd\u0151s website \u2014 and 11 of the solutions have specifically credited AI models as involved in the process.\nThe revered mathematician Terence Tao has a more nuanced look at the progress on his GitHub page, counting eight different problems where AI models made meaningful autonomous progress on an Erd\u0151s problem, with six other cases where progress was made by locating and building on previous research. It\u2019s a long way from AI systems being able to do math without human intervention, but it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s an important role for large models to play.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nOn Mastodon, Tao conjectured that the scalable nature of AI systems makes them \u201cbetter suited for being systematically applied to the \u2018long tail\u2019 of obscure Erd\u0151s problems, many of which actually have straightforward solutions.\u201d\n\u201cAs such, many of these easier Erd\u0151s problems are now more likely to be solved by purely AI-based methods than by human or hybrid means,\u201d Tao continued.\nAnother driving force is a recent shift toward formalization, a labor-intensive task that makes mathematical reasoning easier to verify and extend. Formalization doesn\u2019t require use of AI or even computers, but a new crop of automated tools have made the process far easier. The open source \u201cproof assistant\u201d Lean, which was developed at Microsoft Research in 2013, has become widely used within the field as a way of formalizing proof\u2014 and AI tools like Harmonic\u2019s Aristotle promise to automate much of the work of formalization.\nFor Harmonic founder Tudor Achim, the sudden jump in solved Erd\u0151s problems is less important than the fact that the world\u2019s greatest mathematicians are starting to take those tools seriously. \u201cI care more about the fact that math and computer science professors are using [AI tools],\u201d Achim said. \u201cThese people have reputations to protect, so when they\u2019re saying they use Aristotle or they use ChatGPT, that\u2019s real evidence.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
