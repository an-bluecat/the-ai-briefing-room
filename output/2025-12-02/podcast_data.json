Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday December 3), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon challenges competitors with on-premises Nvidia 'AI Factories'\ndescription0:\nAmazon announced a new product Tuesday called \u201cAI Factories\u201d that allows big corporations and governments to run its AI systems in their own data centers. Or as AWS puts it: Customers supply the power and the data center, and AWS plunks in the AI system, manages it, and can tie it into other AWS cloud services.\nThe idea is to cater to companies and governments concerned with data sovereignty, or absolute control over their data so it can\u2019t wind up in a competitor\u2019s or foreign adversary\u2019s hands. An on-prem AI Factory means not sending their data to a model maker and not even sharing the hardware.\nIf that product name sounds familiar, it should. That\u2019s what Nvidia calls its hardware systems that are chock-full of tools needed to run AI, from its GPU chips to its networking tech. This AWS AI Factory is, in fact, a collaboration with Nvidia, both companies say.\nIn this case, the AWS Factory will use a combination of AWS and Nvidia technology. Companies that deploy these systems can opt for Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell GPUs or Amazon\u2019s new Trainium3 chip. It uses AWS\u2019 homegrown networking, storage, databases, and security and can tap into Amazon Bedrock \u2014 the AI model selection and management service, and AWS SageMaker AI, the model building and training tool.\nInterestingly, AWS is far from the only giant cloud provider installing Nvidia AI Factories. In October, Microsoft showed off its first of many-to-come AI Factories rolling out into its global data centers to run OpenAI workloads. Microsoft didn\u2019t announce at the time that these extreme machines would be available for private clouds. Instead, Microsoft highlighted how it was leaning on a host of Nvidia AI Factory data center tech to build and connect its new \u201cAI Superfactories,\u201d aka new state-of-the-art data centers being built in Wisconsin and Georgia.\nLast month, Microsoft also outlined the data centers and cloud services that would be built in local countries to address the data sovereignty issue. To be fair, its options also include \u201cAzure Local,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s own managed hardware that could be installed on customer sites.\nStill, it is a bit ironic that AI is causing the biggest cloud providers to invest so heavily in corporate private data centers and hybrid clouds like it\u2019s 2009 all over again.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon previews 3 AI agents, including 'Kiro' that can code on its own for days\ndescription1:\nAmazon Web Services on Tuesday announced three new AI agents it calls \u201cfrontier agents,\u201d including one designed to learn how you like to work and then operate on its own for days.\nEach of these agents handle different tasks such as writing code, security processes like code reviews, and automating DevOps tasks such as preventing incidents when pushing new code live. Preview versions of the agents are available now.\nPerhaps the biggest and most interesting claim by AWS is its promise that the frontier agent called \u201cKiro autonomous agent\u201d can work on its own for days at a time.\nKiro is a software coding agent based on AWS\u2019s existing AI coding tool Kiro, which was announced in July. While that existing tool could be used for vibe coding (which is really just prototyping), it was intended to produce operational code, or software that would be pushed live. To make reliable code, the AI must follow a company\u2019s software-coding specifications. Kiro does that through a concept called \u201cspec-driven development.\u201d\nAs Kiro codes, it has the human instruct, confirm, or correct its assumptions, thereby creating specifications. The Kiro autonomous agent watches how the team works in various tools by scanning existing code, among other training means. And then, AWS says, it can work independently.\n\u201cYou simply assign a complex task from the backlog and it independently figures out how to get that work done,\u201d AWS CEO Matt Garman promised when introducing the new product during his keynote at AWS re:Invent on Tuesday.\n\u201cIt actually learns how you like to work, and it continues to deepen its understanding of your code and your products and the standards that your team follows over time,\u201d he said.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAmazon says Kiro maintains \u201cpersistent context across sessions.\u201d In other words, it doesn\u2019t run out of memory and forget what it was supposed to do. It can therefore be handed tasks and work on its own for hours or days, Amazon promises, with minimal human intervention.\nGarman described a task like updating a bit of critical code used by 15 bits of corporate software. Instead of assigning and verifying each update, Kiro can be assigned to fix all 15 in one prompt.\nTo complete the automation of coding tasks, the cloud provider developed AWS Security Agent, an agent that works independently to identify security problems as code is written, tests it after the fact, and then offers suggested fixes. The DevOps Agent rounds out the trio, automatically testing the new code for performance issues, or compatibility with other software, hardware, or cloud settings.\nTo be sure, Amazon\u2019s agents aren\u2019t the first to claim long work windows. For instance OpenAI said last month that GPT\u20115.1-Codex-Max, its agentic coding model, is designed for long runs, too, up to 24 hours.\nIt\u2019s also not totally clear that the biggest hurdle to agentic adoption is the context window (aka the ability to work continuously without stalling out). LLMs still have hallucination and accuracy issues that turn developers into \u201cbabysitters,\u201d they say. So developers often want to assign short tasks and verify quickly before moving on.\nStill, before agents can become like co-workers, context windows must grow bigger. Amazon\u2019s tech is another big step in that direction.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flagship Amazon Web Services event in Las Vegas. This video is brought to you in partnership with AWS.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon releases an impressive new AI chip and teases an Nvidia-friendly roadmap\ndescription2:\nAmazon Web Services, which has been building its own AI training chips for years now, just introduced a new version known as Trainium3 that comes with some impressive specs.\nThe cloud provider, which made the announcement Tuesday at AWS re:Invent 2025, also teased the next product on its AI training product roadmap: Trainium4, which is already in the works and will be able to work with Nvidia\u2019s chips.\nAWS used its annual tech conference to formally launch Trainium3 UltraServer, a system powered by the company\u2019s state-of-the art, 3 nanometer Trainium3 chip, as well as its homegrown networking tech. As you might expect, the third-generation chip and system offer big bumps in performance for AI training and inference over the second-generation chip, according to AWS.\nAWS says the system is more than 4x faster, with 4x more memory, not just for training, but for delivering AI apps at peak demand. Additionally, thousands of UltraServers can be linked together to provide an app with up to 1 million Trainium3 chips \u2014 10x the previous generation. Each UltraServer can host 144 chips, according to the company.\nPerhaps more importantly, AWS says the chips and systems are also 40% more energy efficient than the previous generation. While the world races to build bigger data centers powered by astronomical gigawatts of electricity, data center giant AWS is trying to make systems that drink less, not more.\nIt is, obviously, in AWS\u2019s direct interests to do so. But in its classic, Amazon cost-conscious way, it promises that these systems save its AI cloud customers money, too.\nAWS customers like Anthropic (of which Amazon is also an investor), Japan\u2019s LLM Karakuri, SplashMusic, and Decart have already been using the third-gen chip and system and significantly cut their inference costs, Amazon said.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

AWS promised the chip will provide another big step up in performance and support Nvidia\u2019s NVLink Fusion high-speed chip interconnect technology.\nThis means the AWS Trainium4-powered systems will be able to interoperate and extend their performance with Nvidia GPUs while still using Amazon\u2019s homegrown, lower-cost server rack technology.\nIt\u2019s worth noting, too, that Nvidia\u2019s CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) has become the de facto standard that all the major AI apps are built to support. The Trainium4-powered systems may make it easier to woo big AI apps built with Nvidia GPUs in mind to Amazon\u2019s cloud.\nAmazon did not announce a timeline for Trainium4. If the company follows previous rollout timelines, we\u2019ll likely hear more about Trainium4 at next year\u2019s conference.\nFollow along with all of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the annual enterprise tech event here.\nCheck out the latest reveals on everything from agentic AI and cloud infrastructure to security and much more from the flags\n\ntitle3:\nKalshi raises $1B at $11B valuation, doubling value in under two months\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nPrediction market Kalshi, which allows people to bet on future events, announced on Tuesday that it raised a $1 billion funding round at an $11 billion valuation, confirming TechCrunch\u2019s scoop from last month.\nThe round was led by returning investor Paradigm, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Capital G, and other existing backers. The latest funding comes less than two months after Kalshi announced that it raised $300 million at a $5 billion valuation.\nAlthough the trading platform surged in popularity last year when people used it to predict the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, a large portion of Kalshi\u2019s trades are actually tied to sports, according to The New York Times.\nKalshi is reportedly planning to announce a partnership with CNN. Additionally, future growth is expected to come from various companies using Kalshi to hedge against business-specific risks, such as government shutdowns or adverse weather changes.\nPolymarket, Kalshi\u2019s main rival, was reportedly in talks to raise another round at a $12 billion to $15 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported in October.\n\ntitle4:\nBending Spoons agrees to buy Eventbrite for $500M to revive stalled brand\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nBending Spoons, a company that buys and revitalizes stagnating tech companies, has agreed to purchase Eventbrite for about $500 million, a far cry from the $1.76 billion the company was worth when it went public in 2018.\nJust like many of Bending Spoons\u2019 previous acquisitions, including Evernote, Meetup, Vimeo, and AOL, Eventbrite has a strong brand, but the company\u2019s business has stopped growing, according to audited financials.\nThe events marketplace and ticketing company was co-founded in 2006 by the husband-and-wife team Julia and Kevin Hartz, and Renaud Visage. During its 12 years as a private business, the one-time tech darling raised approximately $330 million in venture capital from top investors such as Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.\nUnlike traditional private equity firms, Bending Spoons buys companies that it intends to hold forever, aiming to turn them profitable by cutting costs, raising prices, and introducing new product features. In October, Bending Spoons announced a massive $270 million funding round that valued the company at $11 billion.\nBesides Bending Spoons, other investors follow the strategy of acquiring, fixing, and holding stalled software firms, often referred to as \u201cventure zombie\u201d companies. These firms include Constellation Software, Curious, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital.\nAndrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, told TechCrunch that the firm buys \u201cgreat companies\u201d at low prices and quickly revives them to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins.\nAudited annual revenue was flat at about $325 million for both fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023. Bending Spoons has agreed to pay approximately 1.7 times Eventbrite\u2019s trailing 12 months\u2019 revenue of $295 million. Despite this seemingly low revenue multiple, Eventbrite stockholders will receive $4.50 in cash per share, an 81% premium over the previous day\u2019s $2.48 closing price.\"\n\nResponse:",
