Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

It now allows developers to embed Google\u2019s SATA-model research capabilities into their own apps. That capability is made possible through Google\u2019s new Interactions API, which is designed to give devs more control in the coming agentic AI era.\nThe new Gemini Deep Research tool is an agent equipped to synthesize mountains of information and handle a large context dump in the prompt. Google says it\u2019s used by customers for tasks ranging from due diligence to drug toxicity safety research.\nGoogle also says it will soon be integrating this new deep research agent into services, including Google Search, Google Finance, its Gemini App, and its popular NotebookLM. This is another step toward preparing for a world where humans don\u2019t Google anything anymore \u2014 their AI agents do.\nThe tech giant says that Deep Research benefits from Gemini 3 Pro\u2019s status as its \u201cmost factual\u201d model that is trained to minimize hallucinations during complex tasks.\nAI hallucinations \u2014 where the LLM just makes stuff up \u2014 are an especially crucial issue for long-running, deep reasoning agentic tasks, in which many autonomous decisions are made over minutes, hours, or longer. The more choices an LLM has to make, the greater the chance that even one hallucinated choice will invalidate the entire output.\nTo prove its progress claims, Google has also created yet another benchmark (as if the AI world needs another one). The new benchmark is unimaginatively named DeepSearchQA and is intended to test agents on complex, multi-step information-seeking tasks. Google has open sourced this benchmark.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nIt also tested Deep Research on Humanity\u2019s Last Exam, a much more interestingly named, independent benchmark of general knowledge filled with impossibly niche tasks; and BrowserComp, a benchmark for browser-based agentic tasks.\nAs you might expect, Google\u2019s new agent bested the competition on its own benchmark, and Humanity\u2019s. However, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 5 Pro was a surprisingly close second all the way around and slightly bested Google on BrowserComp.\nBut those benchmark comparisons were obsolete almost the moment Google published them. Because on the same day, OpenAI launched its highly anticipated GPT 5.2 \u2014 codenamed Garlic. OpenAI says its newest model bests its rivals \u2014 especially Google \u2014 on a suite of the typical benchmarks, including OpenAI\u2019s homegrown one.\nPerhaps one of the most interesting parts of this announcement was the timing. Knowing that the world was awaiting the release of Garlic, Google dropped some AI news of its own.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI fires back at Google with GPT-5.2 after \u2018code red\u2019 memo\ndescription1:\nOpenAI launched its latest frontier model, GPT-5.2, on Thursday amid increasing competition from Google, pitching it as its most advanced model yet and one designed for developers and everyday professional use.\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-5.2 is coming to ChatGPT paid users and developers via the API in three flavors: Instant, a speed-optimized model for routine queries like information-seeking, writing, and translation; Thinking, which excels at complex structured work like coding, analyzing long documents, math, and planning; and Pro, the top-end model aimed at delivering maximum accuracy and reliability for difficult problems.\n\u201cWe designed 5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people,\u201d Fidji Simo, OpenAI\u2019s chief product officer, said Thursday during a briefing with journalists. \u201cIt\u2019s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long context, using tools and then linking complex, multi-step projects.\u201d\nGPT-5.2 lands in the middle of an arms race with Google\u2019s Gemini 3, which is topping LMArena\u2019s leaderboard across most benchmarks (apart from coding \u2014 which Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus-4.5 still has on lock).\nEarly this month, The Information reported that CEO Sam Altman released an internal \u201ccode red\u201d memo to staff amid ChatGPT traffic decline and concerns that it is losing consumer market share to Google. The code red called for a shift in priorities, including stalling on commitments like introducing ads and instead focusing on creating a better ChatGPT experience.\nGPT-5.2 is OpenAI\u2019s push to reclaim leadership, even as some employees reportedly asked for the model release to be pushed back so the company could have more time to improve it. And despite indications that OpenAI would focus its attention on consumer use cases by adding more personalization and customization to ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-5.2 looks to beef up its enterprise opportunities.\nThe company is specifically targeting developers and the tooling ecosystem, aiming to become the default foundation for building AI-powered applications. Earlier this week, OpenAI released new data showing enterprise usage of its AI tools has surged dramatically over the past year.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThis comes as Gemini 3 has become tightly integrated into Google\u2019s product and cloud ecosystem for multimodal and agentic workflows. Google this week launched managed MCP servers that make its Google and Cloud services like Maps and BigQuery easier for agents to plug into. (MCPs are the connectors between AI systems and data and tools.)\nOpenAI says GPT-5.2 sets new benchmark scores in coding, math, science, vision, long-context reasoning, and tool use, which the company claims could lead to \u201cmore reliable agentic workflows, production-grade code, and complex systems that operate across large contexts and real-world data.\u201d\nThose capabilities put it in direct competition with Gemini 3\u2019s Deep Think mode, which has been touted as a major reasoning advancement targeting math, logic, and science. On OpenAI\u2019s own benchmark chart, GPT-5.2 Thinking edges out Gemini 3 and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.5 in nearly every listed reasoning test, from real-world software engineering tasks (SWE-Bench Pro) and doctoral-level science knowledge (GPQA Diamond) to abstract reasoning and pattern discovery (ARC-AGI suites).\nResearch lead Aidan Clark said that stronger math scores aren\u2019t just about solving equations. Mathematical reasoning, he explained, is a proxy for whether a model can follow multi-step logic, keep numbers consistent over time, and avoid subtle errors that could compound over time.\n\u201cThese are all properties that really matter across a wide range of different workloads,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThings like financial modeling, forecasting, doing an analysis of data.\u201d\nDuring the briefing, OpenAI product lead Max Schwarzer said GPT-5.2 \u201cmakes substantial improvements to code generation and debugging\u201d and can walk through complex math and logic step by step. Coding startups like Windsurf and CharlieCode, he added, report \u201cstate-of-the-art agent coding performance\u201d and measurable gains on complex multi-step workflows.\nBeyond coding, Schwarzer said that GPT-5.2 Thinking responses contain 38% fewer errors than its predecessor, making the model more dependable for day-to-day decision-making, research, and writing.\nGPT-5.2 appears to be less a reinvention and more of a consolidation of OpenAI\u2019s last two upgrades. GPT-5, which dropped in August, was a reset that laid the groundwork for a unified system with a router to toggle the model between a fast default model and a deeper \u201cThinking\u201d mode. November\u2019s GPT-5.1 focused on making that system warmer, more conversational, and better suited to agentic and coding tasks. The latest model, GPT-5.2, seems to turn up the dial on all of those advancements, making it a more reliable foundation for production use.\nFor OpenAI, the stakes have never been higher. The company has made commitments to the tune of $1.4 trillion for AI infrastructure buildouts over the next few years to support its growth \u2014 commitments it made when it still had the first-mover advantage among AI companies. But now that Google, which lagged behind at the start, is pushing ahead, that bet might be what\u2019s driving Altman\u2019s \u201ccode red.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s renewed focus on reasoning models is also a risky flex. The systems behind its Thinking and Deep Research modes are more expensive to run than standard chatbots because they chew through more compute. By doubling down on that kind of model with GPT-5.2, OpenAI may be setting up a vicious cycle: spend more on compute to win the leaderboard, then spend even more to keep those high-cost models running at scale.\nOpenAI is already reportedly spending more on compute than it had previously let on. As TechCrunch reported recently, most of OpenAI\u2019s inference spend \u2014 the money it spends on compute to run a trained AI model \u2014 is being paid in cash rather than through cloud credits, suggesting the company\u2019s compute costs have grown beyond what partnerships and credits can subsidize.\nDuring the call, Simo suggested that as OpenAI scales, it is able to offer more products and services to generate more revenue to pay for additional compute.\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to place that in the grand arc of efficiency,\u201d Simo said. \u201cYou are getting, today, a lot more intelligence for the same amount of compute and the same amount of dollars as you were a year ago.\u201d\nFor all its focus on reasoning, one thing that\u2019s absent from today\u2019s launch is a new image generator. Altman reportedly said in his code red memo that image generation would be a key priority moving forward, particularly after Google\u2019s Nano Banana (the nickname for Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model) had a viral moment following its August release.\nLast month, Google launched Nano Banana Pro (aka Gemini 3 Pro Image), an upgraded version with even better text rendering, world knowledge, and an eerie, real-life, unedited vibe to its photos. It also integrates better across Google\u2019s products, as demonstrated over the past week as it pops up in tools and workflows like Google Labs Mixboard for automated presentation generation.\nOpenAI reportedly plans to release another new model in January with better images, improved speed, and better personality, though the company didn\u2019t confirm these plans Thursday.\nOpenAI also said Thursday it\u2019s rolling out new safety measures around mental health use and age verification for teens, but didn\u2019t spend much of the launch pitching those changes.\nThis article has been updated with more information about OpenAI\u2019s compute efficiency status.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

However, the company lost a little ground on its related lawsuit against Apple, which was also over in-app purchase restrictions and commission structure.\nAfter Epic Games launched a version of its Fortnite game that routed around the existing in-app payment systems on iOS and Android devices in 2020, Apple and Google removed the game from their respective app stores. Epic Games used that move to then file antitrust lawsuits against both companies.\nIn Apple\u2019s case, the court ruled the iPhone maker was not a monopolist but said Apple needed to allow developers to point to other payment mechanisms if they chose. Apple has been fighting the specific terms of that agreement, which were today partially overturned by an appeals court that called some of the restrictions \u201coverbroad.\u201d\nOf note, the new filing states Apple can tell developers not to make their links to payments bigger or more prominent than Apple\u2019s own. It also says Apple is allowed to charge a fee on purchases made outside its App Store. The latter is a significant blow to developers, who had finally been able to skirt Apple\u2019s commission.\n\ud83d\udea8 Fortnite is back on the Google Play Store in the U.S. following Google\u2019s compliance with the U.S. District Court\u2019s injunction.

Stay tuned for news of Fortnite's return to Google Play to the rest of\u2026 https://t.co/HgUgZofeBW \u2014 Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) December 11, 2025\nMeanwhile, Epic Games has reason to celebrate by returning to the Google Play Store after Google lost its court battle with the game developer, where it was ruled to have engaged in anticompetitive behavior. Under the new agreement, Google allows app developers to point to alternative payment mechanisms and caps the fees Google could charge.\nEpic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called it a \u201ccomprehensive solution\u201d that doubled down on Android as an open platform.\nThe Apple ruling is below:\nEpic v Apple \u2013 9th Circuit Order \u2013 20251211 by TechCrunch\n\ntitle3:\nDisney hits Google with cease-and-desist claiming 'massive' copyright infringement\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nDisney sent a cease-and-desist letter to Google on Wednesday, alleging that the tech giant has infringed on its copyrights, Variety reports.\nDisney is accusing the tech giant of copyright infringement on a \u201cmassive scale,\u201d claiming it has used AI models and services to commercially distribute unauthorized images and videos, according to the letter seen by Variety.\n\u201cGoogle operates as a virtual vending machine, capable of reproducing, rendering, and distributing copies of Disney\u2019s valuable library of copyrighted characters and other works on a mass scale,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cAnd compounding Google\u2019s blatant infringement, many of the infringing images generated by Google\u2019s AI Services are branded with Google\u2019s Gemini logo, falsely implying that Google\u2019s exploitation of Disney\u2019s intellectual property is authorized and endorsed by Disney.\u201d\nThe letter alleges that Google\u2019s AI systems infringe characters from \u201cFrozen,\u201d \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d \u201cMoana,\u201d \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d \u201cDeadpool,\u201d and more.\nGoogle didn\u2019t confirm or deny Disney\u2019s allegations but did say it will \u201cengage\u201d with the company. \u201cWe have a longstanding and mutually beneficial relationship with Disney, and will continue to engage with them. More generally, we use public data from the open web to build our AI and have built additional innovative copyright controls like Google-extended and Content ID for YouTube, which give sites and copyright holders control over their content,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nDisney\u2019s move comes the same day that it signed a $1 billion, three-year deal with OpenAI that will bring its iconic characters to the company\u2019s Sora AI video generator.\n\ntitle4:\nFord and SK On are ending their US battery joint venture\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nFour years ago, Ford and South Korean battery maker SK On struck a deal to form a joint venture and spend $11.4 billion to build factories in Tennessee and Kentucky that would produce batteries for the next generation of electric F-Series trucks.\nThe factories live on; the joint venture will not.\nSK On, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, said Thursday it reached an agreement with Ford to end the joint venture. The two companies will divide the assets: Ford will take ownership and operation of the twin battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will operate the factory at the massive BlueOval SK campus in Tennessee.\nSK On said it will maintain a strategic partnership with Ford centered on the Tennessee plant, according to Bloomberg.\nWhen reached for comment, a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the company was aware of SK\u2019s disclosure and had nothing further to share at this time.\nThe joint venture was created when the industry was investing billions of dollars to ramp up electric vehicle production. While EV sales have risen over the past several years, demand has not kept up with the industry\u2019s lofty projections. The end of the federal EV tax credit has also dampened the pace of sales.\"\n\nResponse:",
