Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

At the time, the Space Force acknowledged that the pool of awardees was small, but that it aimed to account for this by allowing companies to bid on Lane 1 on an annual basis. The next opportunity to join Lane 1, which has a total expected value of $5.6 billion over five years, will be later in 2024.\nIn a press release announcing the contract, Lt. Col. Douglas Downs, SSC\u2019s materiel leader for space launch procurement, said the force expects to see \u201cincreasing competition and diversity\u201d with the ability to on-ramp new providers.\nThe Phase 3 Lane 1 award period is from fiscal year 2025 to fiscal year 2029, with the potential for a five-year extension. The Space Force anticipates awarding at least 30 missions over that period. The SpaceX win may seem like a foregone conclusion this time, but with new launch companies and vehicles coming online in the next few years, the competition may heat up soon.\n\ntitle2:\nProfit beats expectations as AI boom drives 54% hike\ndescription2:\nIn this photo illustration, a TSMC logo is displayed on the screen of a smartphone.\nShares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest producer of advanced chips, serving clients such as Apple and Nvidia , jumped nearly 10% during trading on Thursday after the company reported a 54% hike in net profit in the third quarter.\nThe company expects annual revenue growth in the last three months of the year, as global chipmakers continue to benefit from demand boosted by artificial intelligence applications.\nShares of chip companies rose on the results. Shares of Nvidia , Micron and AMD were all up almost 1% at market close on Thursday.\nThe company's net income was 325.3 billion New Taiwan dollars ($10.1 billion) over the July-September quarter, surpassing an LSEG estimate of NT$300.2 billion cited by Reuters.\nNet revenue came in at $23.5 billion in the third quarter, up 36% year on year, with TSMC's gross margin rising to 57.8% over July-September, compared with 54.3% in the same period of last year.\n\"Based on the current business outlook, we expect for our fourth-quarter revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion, which represents a 13% sequential increase or a 35% year-over-year increase at the midpoint,\" TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said during an earnings call following the results release, according to a call transcript produced by FactSet.\nIn the third quarter, \"our business was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry leading 3nm and 5nm technologies,\" TSMC said in a statement, referencing its semiconductor nodes.\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia stock rises to new record, above June high as AI trade rekindled\ndescription3:\nJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, speaks during an event in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024.\nThe new high bested a previous record of $140.76, which was set June 20. Shares closed the day up about 1% at $136.93.\nShares of Nvidia rose to a new record Thursday as investors piled back in to the artificial intelligence trade, which had stalled a bit since the summer. The stock rose more than 3% at one point to briefly tap a new intraday high of $140.89.\nNvidia's intraday record comes after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , the world's largest chip producer, beat third-quarter earnings estimates and posted a 54% increase in profit. The company produces chips for companies such as Apple , Nvidia, AMD and ARM .\nNvidia stock hit a closing high of $138.07 on Monday, topping its prior record of $135.58 set June 18. Shares are up 180% year to date and have increased more than ninefold since the beginning of 2023.\nCompanies including Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in massive quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.\nNvidia recently said demand for its next-generation AI GPU, called Blackwell, is \"insane\" and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.\n\u2014 CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.\n\ntitle4:\nMicrosoft could end up with substantial equity in the restructured, for-profit OpenAI\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nHow much equity in OpenAI will Microsoft get once the former becomes a for-profit company? That\u2019s the multibillion-dollar question \u2014 one the two parties are racing to answer ahead of a two-year deadline.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that both Microsoft and OpenAI have hired investment banks to negotiate Microsoft\u2019s equity \u2014 which could be substantial. The tech giant is said to have sunk nearly $14 billion into OpenAI. As of October, OpenAI is the second-most valuable startup in the U.S. behind SpaceX.\nAmong other issues, Microsoft and OpenAI must resolve how much equity will go to CEO Sam Altman and OpenAI employees, as well as which specific governance rights Microsoft will have. Once OpenAI converts to a for-profit, it\u2019ll become a public-benefit corporation, but with a nonprofit component that\u2019ll own equity in the restructured company.\nThe negotiations come as OpenAI\u2019s president, Greg Brockman, is reportedly planning to return from an extended leave as soon as November.\"\n\nResponse:",
