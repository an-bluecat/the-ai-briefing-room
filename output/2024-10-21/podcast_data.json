Dimas Ardian | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nLONDON \u2014 Microsoft will allow businesses to start making their own autonomous artificial intelligence agents starting next month, taking the fight back to Salesforce , which introduced its own configurable agentic AI tools in September. At its \"AI Tour\" event in London on Monday, Microsoft revealed plans to allow organizations to create their own autonomous agents within Copilot Studio, the U.S. tech giant's platform for customizing and building so-called \"copilot\" assistants. These agents had previously been available in private preview after Microsoft announced them initially in May. Starting next month, they'll move into public preview, meaning more organizations can start building AI agents of their own. AI agents can act as virtual workers that can carry out a series of tasks without supervision. They are touted as a major evolution of large language model-based AI from chat interfaces, creating an experience that blends more seamlessly into the background. Beyond adding the ability to create autonomous agents in Copilot Studio, Microsoft said it would also launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, the company's suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps.\nwatch now\nMicrosoft plans to introduce new agents in Dynamics 365 for sales, service, finance and supply chain teams.\nHow can AI agents be used?\nJared Spataro, Microsoft's corporate vice president of modern work and business applications, on Monday displayed an example of an AI agent developed at consulting firm McKinsey. The agent was shown as it parsed out an email to find out what the communication is about, checked its history, mapped it to industry-standard terms, and then found the right person in the firm to take the next step before writing and summarizing a response. It may seem like \"magic,\" but the firm was able to develop its own AI agent just by using human language, not programming languages, according to Spataro.\nMicrosoft demonstrated how its autonomous AI agents work. In this example, a customer service agent receives a request for help on an order. The agent collects contextual data on the order and compares the issue with other common product problems. Then, after retrieving all the information, the AI sends a follow-up email. Microsoft\n\"We're excited about this because of the business value it can drive,\" he noted, adding that McKinsey found it could reduce lead time by as much as 90%.\nCompetition is fierce\nMicrosoft is doubling down on AI agents at a time when competition is intensifying up in the red-hot artificial intelligence space. Last month, at its annual Dreamforce showcase in San Francisco, Salesforce showed off a new platform called Agentforce, which allows enterprise organizations to spin up their own AI agents. Zahra Bahrololoumi, Salesforce's CEO of U.K. and Ireland, criticized the copilot model of AI assistants as not serving the needs of enterprises that well.\n\"All of these copilots activated on the edge, or in email \u2014 they're not connected to or grounded within the context of customer data,\" Bahrololoumi told CNBC in an interview earlier this month. \"How is it going to represent a company accurately and responsibly? It isn't.\" \"I think we won't see so many copilots for enterprise AI activity,\" she added. \"I'm not saying copilots won't exist for other purposes. But in the context of enterprise, for autonomous enterprises to be able to plan, execute and take action \u2014 you're no longer in Copilot there.\" Microsoft declined to comment on Bahrololoumi's remarks when contacted by CNBC. Microsoft and Salesforce have a storied feud. Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff once called on European regulators to investigate Microsoft's deal to buy LinkedIn, suggesting it was in breach of competition rules.\nAI deal with UK government\nSeparately, Microsoft also on Monday announced it had struck a five-year deal with the U.K. government to offer public sector organizations access to its AI tools. Through an agreement with the Crown Commercial Service, the procurement agency of the U.K. government, Microsoft said it will allow public sector organizations to access its Microsoft 365 productivity tool suite, the Azure cloud platform and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a service offered by the tech giant that embeds generative AI into its suite of productivity apps.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta tests facial recognition for spotting 'celeb-bait' ads scams and easier account recovery\ndescription1:\nMeta is expanding tests of facial recognition as an anti-scam measure to combat celebrity scam ads and more broadly, the Facebook owner announced Monday.\nMonika Bickert, Meta\u2019s VP of content policy, wrote in a blog post that some of the tests aim to bolster its existing anti-scam measures, such as the automated scans (using machine learning classifiers) run as part of its ad review system, to make it harder for fraudsters to fly under its radar and dupe Facebook and Instagram users to click on bogus ads.\n\u201cScammers often try to use images of public figures, such as content creators or celebrities, to bait people into engaging with ads that lead to scam websites where they are asked to share personal information or send money. This scheme, commonly called \u2018celeb-bait,\u2019 violates our policies and is bad for people that use our products,\u201d she wrote.\n\u201cOf course, celebrities are featured in many legitimate ads. But because celeb-bait ads are often designed to look real, they\u2019re not always easy to detect.\u201d\nThe tests appear to be using facial recognition as a back-stop for checking ads flags as suspect by existing Meta systems when they contain the image of a public figure at risk of so-called \u201cceleb-bait.\u201d\n\u201c[W]e will try to use facial recognition technology to compare faces in the ad against the public figure\u2019s Facebook and Instagram profile pictures,\u201d Bickert wrote. \u201cIf we confirm a match and that the ad is a scam, we\u2019ll block it.\u201d\nMeta claims the feature is not being used for any other purpose than for fighting scam ads. \u201cWe immediately delete any facial data generated from ads for this one-time comparison regardless of whether our system finds a match, and we don\u2019t use it for any other purpose,\u201d she said.\nThe company said early tests of the approach \u2014 with \u201ca small group of celebrities and public figures\u201d (it did not specify whom) \u2014 has shown \u201cpromising\u201d results in improving the speed and efficacy of detecting and enforcing against this type of scam.\nMeta also told TechCrunch it thinks the use of facial recognition would be effective for detecting deepfake scam ads, where generative AI has been used to produce imagery of famous people.\nThe social media giant has been accused for many years of failing to stop scammers misappropriating famous people\u2019s faces in a bid to use its ad platform to shill scams like dubious crypto investments to unsuspecting users. So it\u2019s interesting timing for Meta to be pushing facial recognition-based anti-fraud measures for this problem now, at a time when the company is simultaneously trying to grab as much user data as it can to train its commercial AI models (as part of the wider industry-wide scramble to build out generative AI tools).\nIn the coming weeks Meta said it will start displaying in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who\u2019ve been hit by celeb-bait \u2014 letting them know they\u2019re being enrolled in the system.\n\u201cPublic figures enrolled in this protection can opt-out in their Accounts Center anytime,\u201d Bickert noted.\nMeta is also testing use of facial recognition for spotting celebrity imposer accounts \u2014 for example, where scammers seek to impersonate public figures on the platform in order to expand their opportunities for fraud \u2014 again by using AI to compare profile pictures on a suspicious account against a public figure\u2019s Facebook and Instagram profile pictures.\n\u201cWe hope to test this and other new approaches soon,\u201d Bickert added.\nVideo selfies plus AI for account unlocking\nAdditionally, Meta has announced that it\u2019s trialing the use of facial recognition applied to video selfies to enable faster account unlocking for people who have been locked out of their Facebook/Instagram accounts after they\u2019ve been taken over by scammers (such as if a person were tricked into handing over their passwords).\nThis looks intended to appeal to users by promoting the apparent utility of facial recognition tech for identity verification \u2014 with Meta implying it will be a quicker and easier way to regain account access than uploading an image of a government-issued ID (which is the usual route for unlocking access access now).\n\u201cVideo selfie verification expands on the options for people to regain account access, only takes a minute to complete and is the easiest way for people to verify their identity,\u201d Bickert said. \u201cWhile we know hackers will keep trying to exploit account recovery tools, this verification method will ultimately be harder for hackers to abuse than traditional document-based identity verification.\u201d\nThe facial recognition-based video selfie identification method Meta is testing will require the user to upload a video selfie that will then be processed using facial recognition technology to compare the video against profile pictures on the account they\u2019re trying to access.\nMeta claims the method is similar to identity verification used to unlock a phone or access other apps, such as Apple\u2019s Face ID on the iPhone. \u201cAs soon as someone uploads a video selfie, it will be encrypted and stored securely,\u201d Bickert added. \u201cIt will never be visible on their profile, to friends, or to other people on Facebook or Instagram. We immediately delete any facial data generated after this comparison regardless of whether there\u2019s a match or not.\u201d\nConditioning users to upload and store a video selfie for ID verification could be one way for Meta to expand its offerings in the digital identity space \u2014 if enough users opt in to uploading their biometrics.\nNo tests in U.K. or EU \u2014 for now\nAll these tests of facial recognition are being run globally, per Meta. However the company noted, rather conspicuously, that tests are not currently occurring in the U.K. or the European Union \u2014 where comprehensive data protection regulations apply. (In the specific case of biometrics for ID verification, the bloc\u2019s data protection framework demands explicit consent from the individuals concerned for such a use case.)\nGiven this, Meta\u2019s tests appear to fit within a wider PR strategy it has mounted in Europe in recent months to try to pressure local lawmakers to dilute citizens\u2019 privacy protections. This time, the cause it\u2019s invoking to press for unfettered data-processing-for-AI is not a (self-serving) notion of data diversity or claims of lost economic growth but the more straightforward goal of combating scammers.\n\u201cWe are engaging with the U.K. regulator, policymakers, and other experts while testing moves forward,\u201d Meta spokesman Andrew Devoy told TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to seek feedback from experts and make adjustments as the features evolve.\u201d\nHowever, while use of facial recognition for a narrow security purpose might be acceptable to some \u2014 and, indeed, might be possible for Meta to undertake under existing data protection rules \u2014 using people\u2019s data to train commercial AI models is a whole other kettle of fish.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta's smart glasses outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some stores, even before AI features roll out\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nThe Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are the top selling product in 60% of all Ray-Ban stores throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, according to Upload VR. The detail came from EssilorLuxottica CFO Stefano Grassi, who revealed during the eyewear giant\u2019s earnings call last week that Ray-Ban Meta proved to be a significant driver for the company\u2019s sales.\nIn Europe, Meta has yet to roll out multimodal AI features for its Ray-Ban smart glasses, citing a lack of clarity from regulators in the EU. The company says it\u2019s committed to bringing all of its Meta AI features to Europe at some point, but the current lack of AI features doesn\u2019t appear to be hindering Ray-Ban Meta\u2019s sales in the region. It\u2019s possible some consumers are drawn to the glasses\u2019 speakers and cameras more than its AI capabilities.\nIn any case, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are proving to be a larger success than Meta originally expected. That early traction may have been a factor in Meta expanding its partnership with EssilorLuxottica into the next decade.\n\ntitle3:\nGE HealthCare announces time-saving AI tool for doctors who treat cancer\ndescription3:\nGE Healthcare booth is seen ahead of the 2022 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) at China National Convention Center on August 28, 2022 in Beijing, China.\n\"For cancer patients, the treatment journey can last years and involve numerous doctor visits,\" he said.\nCareIntellect for Oncology will be able to summarize clinical reports and identify when patients are deviating from their treatment plans, Kass-Hout said. The system can flag when a patient misses a lab test, for instance, so that their doctor can determine the best next steps.\n\"It's very time-consuming, very frustrating for these clinicians,\" Dr. Taha Kass-Hout , GE HealthCare's global chief science and technology officer, told CNBC in an interview.\nHealth-care data is notoriously difficult to analyze, and as much as 97% of the data produced by hospitals goes unused, according to a Deloitte report. That information is stored across numerous vendors and file formats such as images, lab test results, clinical notes and device readings, which can be extremely taxing for doctors to sort through.\nCareIntellect for Oncology, as the tool is called, will help oncologists get up to speed on a patient's history and disease progression by quickly showing them the data they need, the company said. GE HealthCare wants to spare oncologists the headache of digging through records so they can focus on caring for their patients, the company said.\nGE HealthCare on Monday announced a new artificial intelligence application it said will save time for doctors who diagnose and treat cancer.\nCareIntellect for Oncology can also help identify relevant clinical trials that patients might be eligible for, saving oncologists hours of work, said Chelsea Vane, vice president of digital products at GE HealthCare. That process has traditionally required doctors to scroll through a database of available trials, memorize inclusion and exclusion criteria and dig through patient records to determine a good fit, Vane told CNBC.\n\"What we've done is remove that,\" she said.\nThe purpose of the new app is to save oncologists time and effort, but if doctors want to dive into more detail, CareIntellect for Oncology allows them to view the original record that's referenced, the company said.\nGE HealthCare is planning to make CareIntellect for Oncology widely available to U.S. customers in 2025, and it will initially be optimized for prostate and breast cancers. Health organizations such as Tampa General Hospital are already evaluating it, the company said. Since the tool is cloud-based, it will drive recurring revenue for GE HealthCare, Kass-Hout said.\nThe company is planning to introduce additional apps under the CareIntellect brand in the future, Kass-Hout said. The oncology tool is the first offering, and health-care organizations will be able to easily pick and choose the apps that they want to enable, he added.\nGE HealthCare is also hoping to integrate its CareIntellect products with some of the other early stage AI initiatives it teased on Monday.\nThe company highlighted five new AI products that it is developing, including a collaborative team of AI agents, a tool to predict an aggressive type of breast cancer recurrence, and a tool to flag suspicious mammography scans to radiologists more quickly.\nGE HealthCare decided to preview the new tools to give customers an idea of the problems it's trying to solve, Kass-Hout said. The company will solicit feedback from health-care organizations and work with regulators as necessary, he said.\nFor instance, GE HealthCare is exploring how a group of AI agents can work together as a team to support doctors through its tool called Health Companion.\nThe agents in Health Companion will be trained as experts in specific domains, such as radiology, pathology or genomics, and offer insights based on their expertise, Kass-Hout said. The agents could identify whether a specific symptom is a side effect of treatment or a sign of disease progression, for example, and suggest next steps, he added.\nIdeally, the tool will give doctors the same kind of support they'd expect from working with a multidisciplinary team, Kass-Hout said. But while consulting a panel of experts can take days or weeks, Health Companion would be available immediately.\n\"At the moment, it's an early concept,\" he said. \"Our aim is to elevate the standard of care and get ahead of the overburden of clinicians trying to take care of their patient.\"\nWATCH: The Pulse of AI in Health Care\n\ntitle4:\nxAI, Elon Musk's AI startup, launches an API\ndescription4:\nIn August, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI promised to make Grok, the company\u2019s flagship generative AI model powering a number of features on X, available via an API. Now, that API has arrived \u2014 albeit a bit bare-bones at the moment.\nThe xAI API only has a single model, \u201cgrok-beta,\u201d priced at $5 per million input tokens (~750,000 words) or $15 per million output tokens. Tokens are subdivided bits of raw data, like the syllables \u201cfan,\u201d \u201ctas,\u201d and \u201ctic\u201d in the word \u201cfantastic.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear which Grok model \u201cgrok-beta\u201d might be; Grok 2 is the very latest on X. The documentation for the API refers to Grok 2 and Grok mini, a lightweight and more affordable version of Grok \u2014 so it could well be a technical issue.\nImage Credits:xAI\nSome users on X also reported encountering problems paying for usage credits.\nThe xAI API supports function calling, which connects Grok models to external tools such as databases and search engines. And, although they don\u2019t appear to be live yet, the documentation hints at vision models capable of analyzing both text and images.\nMusk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company \u2014 which recently moved into OpenAI\u2019s old offices \u2014 released its first Grok model on X to X Premium+ users, who pay $16 a month.\nGrok has what Musk has described as \u201ca rebellious streak\u201d \u2014 a willingness to answer \u201cspicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.\u201d Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won\u2019t hear from ChatGPT.\nGrok has become increasingly ingrained in the X experience. Thanks to an integration with the open image generator Flux, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). It summarizes news and trending events (often with mistakes, mind you), and it may enhance X\u2019s search capabilities, account bios, post analytics, and reply functions in the future.\nxAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. In May, xAI raised $6 billion in a funding round led by investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and Fidelity.\nMusk often asserts that X\u2019s data gives xAI a substantial leg up compared to rivals. This month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts.\nAs part of the pitch for xAI\u2019s $6 billion funding round, the startup also outlined a vision where its models would be trained on data from Musk\u2019s various companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and The Boring Company, and its models could then improve technology across those companies.\nTesla shareholders, for one, weren\u2019t on board with that plan. Several sued Musk over the decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what is essentially a competing venture.\nMusk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which has been accused of worsening smog with unauthorized turbines. The company hopes to upgrade the data center next year, but will need approval from the Tennessee Valley Authority in order to do so.\"\n\nResponse:",
