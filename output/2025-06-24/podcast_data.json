Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The hack was linked to Paragon Solutions, an Israeli spyware maker that was acquired in December of last year by American private equity giant AE Industrial Partners.\nAnd according to a research report in May, the governments of Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore are likely customers of Paragon.\n\u201cWe disagree with the House Chief Administrative Officer\u2019s characterization in the strongest possible terms,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \u201cMessages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning only the recipients and not even WhatsApp can see them. This is a higher level of security than most of the apps on the CAO\u2019s approved list that do not offer that protection.\u201d\nThis story was updated to clarify that the U.S. House\u2019s top official has issued the ban, as well as to incorporate Meta\u2019s comment.\n\ntitle3:\nHow Synthflow AI is cutting through the noise in a loud AI voice category\ndescription3:\nThe conversational AI market has exploded since ChatGPT was released in November 2022 and is predicted to grow into a nearly $50 billion global industry by 2031, according to MarketsAndMarkets.\nSynthflow AI is just one of many companies building in this space that hopes to stand out from the pack because of its focus on being enterprise-grade and easy to set up.\nBerlin-based Synthflow is a no-code platform that lets enterprises build and deploy customized white-labeled voice AI customer service agents. The company, which launched in 2023, has amassed more than 1,000 customers and has handled more than 45 million calls.\nThe startup\u2019s voice agents are both HIPAA and GDPR compliant and can be plugged into more than 200 integrations with other enterprise platforms, including Salesforce, Twilio, and HubSpot, among others.\nHakob Astabatsyan, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that he and his co-founders, Albert Astabatsyan, now CPO, and Sassun Mirzakhan-Saky, now CTO, started messing around with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT API back in early 2023 to find potential ways to build no-code business applications on top of the AI model.\nThey started with a text-to-text AI bot and then tried to build a voice bot. When they realized how much harder voice was, they got excited about the potential.\n\u201cWe realized, oh my god, voice is really complicated, right? To actually make AI speak in real time like we do, having this 400 milliseconds latency, and handling interruptions, it turned out to be such a complicated task,\u201d Astabatsyan said. \u201cWe fell in love with this problem, and we said, look, we\u2019re gonna work only on voice bots from now on.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThe group formed Synthflow and spent the rest of 2023 building. They launched Synthflow\u2019s first version of the product at the beginning of 2024 before releasing an enterprise-grade version of the tech at the end of the year. The company grew 15x last year and has seen over 90% retention from its enterprise customers, according to Astabatsyan.\n\u201cWe process 5 million calls monthly,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year, it was like, I don\u2019t know, 1 million, 2 million, and then we started growing very quickly. This is where Synthflow started really getting better and better because we had this velocity.\u201d\nThe startup also recently raised a $20 million Series A round led by Accel with participation from existing investors Atlantic Labs and Singular. Astabatsyan said the company raised this recent round so that it could expand its team, boost research and development, and open its first U.S. office in an undecided location.\nLuca Bocchio, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch that the Accel team had been tracking Synthflow since it started developing its first product. What stood out to Bocchio was the founding team\u2019s drive and its early push into building enterprise-friendly integrations.\n\u201cThis team has [had] really strong views since the get-go about creating more depth with the technology and extensive integrations across CRMs, across tools enterprises may use to really provide enterprise-grade compliance,\u201d Bocchio said.\nRegardless of the company\u2019s traction, conversational AI seems poised to be a tough category. There are numerous other companies building in the space, including Bret Taylor\u2019s Sierra, which has raised $285 million in VC money, and Bland AI, which has raised more than $50 million in venture funding, to name a couple.\n\u201cAI is moving so fast, and sometimes things happen faster than you would expect,\u201d Astabatsyan said. \u201cBut for us, it\u2019s very clear. We\u2019re at this stage where, I would say, [we\u2019re] in a post-product-market-fit era, where we know who our customers are. We have a pretty clear idea what\u2019s our product roadmap, and where we want to be in the next three to five years.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nIndia's GoKwik raised a small $13M round for a hefty leap in valuation\ndescription4:\nGoKwik, an Indian startup that offers a suite of integrated e-commerce products, has raised a small round of $13 million, which it calls a \u201cgrowth\u201d round, that has boosted its valuation to $450 million pre-money.\nWhile the new funding round, led by RTP Global, is 63% smaller than its Series B of $35 million, announced in May 2022, it has valued the New Delhi-based startup 43% more than its last pre-money valuation of $315 million. The fresh funding also included participation from the startup\u2019s existing investors, namely Z47, Peak XV Partners, and Think Investments, bringing its total fundraising to $68 million since its inception in 2020.\nBut what has made GoKwik so attractive to investors? Its offerings help companies, big and small, set up shop online and enter the direct-to-consumer (D2C) space.\nImage Credits:Jagmeet Singh / TechCrunch\nThe D2C space is expected to see a significant increase over time as more brands poised to come online target young consumers and the internet reaches new homes. In India, the world\u2019s second-largest internet market after China and the most populous country, the D2C market is expected to reach $60 billion in value by 2027, up from $12 billion in 2022, per a report (PDF) by KPMG.\nCurrently, GoKwik has more than 12,000 paying merchants, up from 2,500 to 3,000 a year ago, spread over India, Europe, the U.K., and the U.S. These merchants use its SaaS products that allow them to set up their online stores powered by Shopify, Magento, Salesforce, and WooCommerce and enable checkout, online payments, and facilities to offer returns and cash-on-delivery options. It also helps brands to do commerce via WhatsApp, a popular platform for businesses and consumers in markets like India, parts of Europe, and Brazil.\nGoKwik counts brands like Indian eyewear giant Lenskart, personal care brand Honasa Consumer, cosmetics company Lakm\u00e9, London\u2019s Pepe Jeans, and Licester\u2019s Xplosive Ape as customers.\nSome of the products that GoKwik offers are also available through other players. For instance, Razorpay and Cashfree Payments offer checkout solutions; CleverTap and MoEngage offer CRM.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nBut Chirag Taneja, co\u2011founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that GoKwik\u2019s suite of products is integrated so customers tend to buy at least two of them on average. \u201cIf you use our login product, it helps you do retargeting better. Hence, our KwikEngage product emerges there, which is a WhatsApp commerce piece. Similarly, if you use our checkout product, the abandoned cart, for abandoned carts, you end up using our KwikEngage piece,\u201d he said.\nThis has helped GoKwik increase its annualized revenue by 20% year-over-year, reaching over $30 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) this year, up from $25 million last year. It has helped brands process a cumulative gross merchandise value of $2 billion, with 55% of transactions involving prepaid payments and 45% cash-on-delivery. Of all the prepaid payments, 80% are via the Indian government\u2019s Unified Payments Interface.\nGoKwik co-founder and CEO Chirag Taneja. Image Credits:GoKwik\nWith the fresh funding, GoKwik aims to expand its presence and customer base by entering new markets and deepening its presence in areas where WhatsApp has a large consumer base, such as Germany, France, and Latin American countries, including Brazil. The startup also plans to bolster AI\u2019s presence on its products. It already offers solutions such as AI calling for abandoned carts. Furthermore, the startup plans to enable Indian merchants to sell their products to foreign customers with a global checkout solution that would integrate Stripe and other international payment processing services.\nGoKwik currently has a runway of 60 to 70 months, with close to $35 million to $37 million in the bank, and is targeting profitability within the next 18 months. It also looks to go public within the next 3 to 5 years. Meanwhile, the startup is attracting investor interest, although Taneja confirmed to TechCrunch that it is not currently raising more funds.\nThe startup has a headcount of around 400 people, primarily based in its offices in Gurugram and Bengaluru, with a handful of employees also based in the U.K.\"\n\nResponse:",
