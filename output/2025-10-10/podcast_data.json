Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

He gushed about sitting across from Trump at a Windsor Castle state dinner, telling the president \u201chow grateful I am for everything he\u2019s doing.\u201d He praised Elon Musk\u2019s government efficiency efforts and said he hadn\u2019t closely followed news about immigration raids or Trump\u2019s attacks on the media.\nThe 50-minute conversation reportedly ended after Benioff turned to his public relations executive, apparently noticing her expression. \u201cWhat about the political questions?\u201d he could be heard asking. \u201cToo spicy?\u201d\nThough Benioff\u2019s shift mirrors Silicon Valley\u2019s broader accommodation of Trump, the exchange offered a rare glimpse of just how far that repositioning can go. The question now: will other Bay Area tech CEOs follow Benioff\u2019s lead and call for federal troops in their own backyard?\n\ntitle1:\nThe billion-dollar infrastructure deals powering the AI boom\ndescription1:\nIt takes a lot of computing power to run an AI product \u2014 and as the tech industry races to tap the power of AI models, there\u2019s a parallel race underway to build the infrastructure that will power them. On a recent earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure by the end of the decade \u2014 with much of that money coming from AI companies. Along the way, they\u2019re placing immense strain on power grids and pushing the industry\u2019s building capacity to its limit.\nBelow, we\u2019ve laid out everything we know about the biggest AI infrastructure projects, including major spending from Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI. We\u2019ll keep it updated as the boom continues and the numbers climb even higher.\nMicrosoft\u2019s $1 billion investment in OpenAI\nThis is arguably the deal that kicked off the whole contemporary AI boom: In 2019, Microsoft made a $1 billion investment in a buzzy non-profit called OpenAI, known mostly for its association with Elon Musk. Crucially, the deal made Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI \u2014 and as the demands of model training became more intense, more of Microsoft\u2019s investment started to come in the form of Azure cloud credit rather than cash.\nIt was a great deal for both sides: Microsoft was able to claim more Azure sales, and OpenAI got more money for its biggest single expense. In the years that followed, Microsoft would build its investment up to nearly $14 billion \u2014 a move that is set to pay off enormously when OpenAI converts into a for-profit company.\nThe partnership between the two companies has unwound more recently. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be using Microsoft\u2019s cloud exclusively, instead giving the company a right of first refusal on future infrastructure demands but pursuing others if Azure couldn\u2019t meet their needs. More recently, Microsoft began exploring other foundation models to power its AI products, establishing even more independence from the AI giant.\nOpenAI\u2019s arrangement with Microsoft was so successful that it\u2019s become a common practice for AI services to sign on with a particular cloud provider. Anthropic has received $8 billion in investment from Amazon, while making kernel-level modifications on the company\u2019s hardware to make it better suited for AI training. Google Cloud has also signed on smaller AI companies like Lovable and Windsurf as \u201cprimary computing partners,\u201d although those deals did not involve any investment. And even OpenAI has gone back to the well, receiving a $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, giving it capacity to buy even more of the company\u2019s GPUs.\nThe rise of Oracle\nOn June 30, 2025, Oracle revealed in an SEC filing that it had signed a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner; this is more than the company\u2019s cloud revenues for all of the previous fiscal year. OpenAI was eventually revealed as the partner, securing Oracle a spot alongside Google as one of OpenAI\u2019s string of post-Microsoft hosting partners. Unsurprisingly, the company\u2019s stock went shooting up.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

On September 10, Oracle revealed a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, set to begin in 2027. Oracle\u2019s stock climbed even higher, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the richest man in the world. The sheer scale of the deal is stunning: OpenAI does not have $300 billion to spend, so the figure presumes immense growth for both companies, and more than a little faith.\nBut before a single dollar is spent, the deal has already cemented Oracle as one of the leading AI infrastructure providers \u2014 and a financial force to be reckoned with.\nNvidia\u2019s investment spree\nAs AI labs scramble to build infrastructure, they\u2019re mostly all buying GPUs from one company: Nvidia. That trade has made Nvidia flush with cash \u2014 and it\u2019s been investing that cash back into the industry in increasingly unconventional ways. In September 2025, the company bought a 4% stake in rival Intel for $5 billion \u2014 but even more surprising has been the deals with its own customers. One week after the Intel deal was revealed, the company announced a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, paid for with GPUs that would be used in OpenAI\u2019s ongoing data center projects. Nvidia has since announced a similar deal with Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, and OpenAI launched a separate GPU-for-stock arrangement with AMD.\nIf that seems circular, it should. Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are valuable because they\u2019re so scarce \u2014 and by trading them directly into an ever-inflating data center scheme, Nvidia is making sure they stay that way. You could say the same thing about OpenAI\u2019s privately held stock, which is all the more valuable because it can\u2019t be obtained through public markets. For now, OpenAI and Nvidia are riding high and nobody seems too worried \u2014 but if the momentum starts to flag, this sort of arrangement will get a lot more scrutiny.\nBuilding tomorrow\u2019s hyperscale data centers\nFor companies like Meta that already have significant legacy infrastructure, the story is more complicated \u2014 although equally expensive. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028.\nIn just the first half of 2025, the company spent $30 billion more than the previous year, driven largely by the company\u2019s growing AI ambitions. Some of that spending goes toward big ticket cloud contracts, like a recent $10 billion deal with Google Cloud, but even more resources are being poured into two massive new data centers.\nA new 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, dubbed Hyperion, will cost an estimated $10 billion to build out and provide an estimated 5 gigawatts of compute power. Notably, the site includes an arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to handle the increased energy load. A smaller site in Ohio, called Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas.\nThat kind of buildout comes with real environmental costs. Elon Musk\u2019s xAI built its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. The plant has quickly become one of the county\u2019s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, thanks to a string of natural gas turbines that experts say violate the Clean Air Act.\nThe Stargate moonshot\nJust two days after his second inauguration, President Trump announced a joint venture between SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, meant to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure in the United States. Named \u201cStargate\u201d after the 1994 film, the project arrived with incredible amounts of hype, with Trump calling it \u201cthe largest AI infrastructure project in history.\u201d Sam Altman seemed to agree, saying, \u200b\u200b\u201dI think this will be the most important project of this era.\u201d\nIn broad strokes, the plan was for SoftBank to provide the funding, with Oracle handling the buildout with input from OpenAI. Overseeing it all was Trump, who promised to clear away any regulatory hurdles that might slow down the build. But there were doubts from the beginning, including from Elon Musk, Altman\u2019s business rival, who claimed the project did not have the available funds.\nAs the hype has died down, the project has lost some momentum. In August, Bloomberg reported that the partners were failing to reach consensus. Nonetheless, the project has moved forward with the construction of eight data centers in Abilene, Texas, with construction on the final building set to be finished by the end of 2026.\nThis article was first published on September 22.\n\ntitle2:\nNavan plows ahead with IPO during shutdown, aims for $6.45B valuation\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nCorporate travel management company Navan \u2014 once known as TripActions \u2014 filed updated IPO documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, even though the federal government is currently shut down.\nNavan is proceeding under new SEC rules that allows wanna-be public companies that are in limbo during the shutdown to file updated information, including share count and pricing, and have their statements automatically okayed in 20 days without staff scrutiny. Once the filings are declared effective, Navan can kick off its roadshow. The rule, however, doesn\u2019t mean that staff can\u2019t ask questions or require amended filings later.\nNavan declined to comment to TechCrunch about its updated IPO documents.\nThe going thought was that the shutdown would cool and possibly freeze an IPO market that had just started to thaw. Even with this rule, many companies would rather get a green light from a staffer than go it alone, sources told Bloomberg. So the tech world will be watching how Navan\u2019s gambit fairs.\nNavan\u2019s updated filing shows the company plans to sell 30 million shares, with insiders selling an additional 7 million. It priced its range at $24 to $26. At the high-end, the company would raise more than $960 million and be valued at $6.45 billion. Navan is backed by Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Zeev Ventures, and Greenoaks.\nNavan generated rolling 12-month revenue of $613 million (up 32%), with losses of $188 million, according to the updated filing.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle Chrome silences those pesky notifications\ndescription3:\nGoogle\u2019s Chrome web browser is about to become much less noisy.\nOn Friday, the technology giant announced a new feature that will automatically disable browser notifications for the websites you haven\u2019t interacted with recently, disrupting their ability to pop up alerts and updates that you may no longer be interested in.\nThe feature will launch on Chrome on Android and on desktop.\nThe feature expands on existing functionality already available in Chrome\u2019s Safety Check feature, which revokes camera and location permissions from websites you don\u2019t visit anymore.\nThe company tacitly admits that browser notifications, as designed, might have been a bad idea, saying that its own data shows users receive a high volume of notifications but rarely interact with them. Less than 1% of all notifications receive any interactions from users, notes Google.\nImage Credits:Google (screenshot)\nStill, the tech giant believes some notifications can be helpful, which is why it won\u2019t revoke those for installed web apps \u2014 only for the sites where there\u2019s low user engagement and high volume of notifications sent. This change alone could push spammy websites that push a lot of notifications to reconsider how many they want to send alerts, so they won\u2019t lose access entirely.\nUnwanted notifications have been an issue facing consumers for years. On the iPhone, for instance, Apple was forced to add controls that let users send their push notifications to a daily summary, mute them, or turn them off altogether from the notification message itself, after consumer frustrations with the notification system grew.\nGoogle says it will inform users when it\u2019s removing notification permissions, allowing users to change the setting back, if they prefer. If users would rather Google didn\u2019t intervene, they can also opt to turn off this auto-revocation feature altogether, the company notes.\nThe feature had been in testing ahead of today\u2019s official launch. Google found that these changes didn\u2019t significantly impact the total number of clicks on notifications, an indication that people weren\u2019t really engaging much with these pop-ups to begin with.\n\ntitle4:\nMusk's Boring Co. violated environmental regulations nearly 800 times, Nevada alleges\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nElon Musk\u2019s Boring Co., the tunneling and infrastructure firm, repeatedly violated state environmental regulations, even after the company agreed not to, Nevada regulators say.\nThe Boring Co., which is in the process of expanding a tunnel network under Las Vegas, is accused of nearly 800 violations, according to a report from ProPublica. Nearly 100 of the violations occurred after the company signed an agreement with state regulators in 2022, which sought to force the company to comply with state laws.\nThe alleged violations include digging without approval, dumping untreated water onto city streets, failing to install silt fences, and tracking dirt from construction sites onto nearby roadways.\nThe Boring Co. could have been fined more than $3 million, but regulators decided to group some violations together, bringing the fine down to $242,800.\nThe Nevada Division of Environmental Protection said that reducing the total \u201coffers a reasonable penalty that will still serve to deter future non-compliance conduct.\u201d\nThe Las Vegas tunnel system is planned to grow from a few miles today to 68 miles connecting 104 stations.\nBut that expansion hasn\u2019t been without other problems. Operations on a tunnel that Boring Co. is building to the Las Vegas airport had to be suspended in September because a worker sustained a \u201ccrushing injury\u201d when they became pinned between two 4,000-foot pipes.\"\n\nResponse:",
