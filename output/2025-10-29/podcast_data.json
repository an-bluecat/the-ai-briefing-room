Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday October 30), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft Azure is down, affecting 365, Xbox, Minecraft, and others\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft Azure, the cloud computing service provided by the company, is experiencing a significant outage on Wednesday. The problems started around noon ET, and Microsoft has acknowledged the issue on the service\u2019s status page.\nAccording to Microsoft, \u201cWe suspect that an inadvertent configuration change triggered this issue.\u201d The company has not indicated when service will be restored.\nMultiple Microsoft services have gone offline as part of this outage, including Microsoft 365, Xbox, and Minecraft. Websites from other businesses, such as Costco and Starbucks, are also inaccessible.\nThis outage takes place just hours before Microsoft is scheduled to announce its earnings results this afternoon.\nIt also follows a recent outage experienced by Amazon AWS a week ago. The incident affected various websites, banks, and certain government services.\n\ntitle1:\nGM cuts thousands of EV and battery factory workers\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nGeneral Motors is laying off thousands of workers across multiple electric vehicle and battery plants in the U.S., according to multiple outlets.\nAround 1,200 employees at the company\u2019s EV factory in Detroit, Michigan, are being placed on \u201cindefinite layoff.\u201d Further cuts and temporary layoffs are being made at GM\u2019s Ultium Cells battery factories in Ohio and Tennessee. GM will also idle those battery factories starting on January 5, according to the Wall Street Journal, with plans to resume production in the middle of 2026.\nThe job cuts come just a few days after GM announced layoffs to some of its white-collar workforce and announced a $1.6 billion hit as it reworks its electric vehicle plans.\nGM also recently ended its BrightDrop commercial electric van program. The company \u2014 and many of its rivals \u2014 are pushing EVs less in the United States after the loss of the federal tax credit and the loosening of regulatory restrictions on internal combustion vehicles.\n\ntitle2:\nBox CEO Aaron Levie on how AI is changing the enterprise SaaS landscape\ndescription2:\nBox co-founder and CEO Aaron Levie doesn\u2019t think AI agents will replace enterprise SaaS (software-as-a-service) companies. Instead, he believes that the more likely future is a hybrid combination of SaaS plus agents, he said, speaking onstage at the TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 conference on Wednesday.\n\u201cGenerally, once you have a business process, you want to be able to define that in, effectively, business logic with deterministic systems \u2014 just because the risk of that changing any given day is very high,\u201d explained Levie.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing something mission critical \u2014 we\u2019ve already seen great examples of either data being leaked because of agents, or an agent going and, you know, maybe blowing up your database or doing something in production you didn\u2019t expect. So you want to have some sort of \u2018church and state\u2019 between the deterministic side of your software and the non-deterministic side.\u201d\nHe painted a picture of a future of enterprise software where the SaaS is used for the core business workflow, and then the agents ride on top of that. These agents would be helpful with making decisions, automating workflows, or, essentially, just accelerating whatever process the person was trying to do in the system, the exec said.\nIn addition, Levie pointed out that this reconfiguration would dramatically impact the business model of enterprise SaaS.\n\u201cThe thing that I\u2019m very convinced of is we\u2019ll have about 100 times more, maybe 1,000 times more, agents than we have people. So you\u2019ll have way more users of that software system, or SaaS, as agents,\u201d Levie said.\nAs a result, the typical \u201cper-seat\u201d business model would no longer work, and instead, companies would have to sell some form of consumption and volume-oriented use cases with AI agents.\nThese changes are a market opportunity for startups, particularly those that are building for the agent-first era, rather than bigger companies that are trying to integrate agents into existing processes.\nSmaller startups, he said, have no business processes to change, so they can design a new process in an agent-first way.\nThis presents an opportunity for startups to build solutions for the enterprise space to make the change management process easier and more palatable, Levie said.\nHe encouraged entrepreneurs to capitalize on this shift by building.\n\u201cWe are in this window right now that we have not been in for about 15 years, which is \u2014 there\u2019s a complete platform shift happening in tech that\u2019s opening up a spot for a new set of companies to emerge,\u201d Levie said.\n\u201cAnd I would just, you know, try and fully exploit that.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nYouTube announces 'voluntary exit program' for US staff\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nYouTube is conducting a \u201cvoluntary exit program\u201d with severance for U.S.-based employees, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Wednesday. The news was first reported by Sources.\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan told employees about the program via an internal memo on Wednesday.\nThe memo also announced that the Google-owned company was reorganizing its product teams into three separate organizations that all report directly to Mohan. The \u201cSubscription Products\u201d team will focus on YouTube\u2019s subscription products across YouTube Music & Premium and OTT.\nThe \u201cViewer Products\u201d team will focus on the viewer experience across the main YouTube app, YouTube Kids, Learning, Trust & Safety, and more. Last, the \u201cCreator & Community Products\u201d organization will focus on supporting creators and building community.\nThe company says no roles are being eliminated as part of these changes.\nThe move comes as Alphabet released its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, reporting that YouTube\u2019s advertising revenue hit $10.26 billion in the period, marking a 15% year-over-year increase.\n\ntitle4:\nSan Francisco mayor: 'We should be the testbed for emerging tech'\ndescription4:\nWaymo and Zoox robotaxis are a regular sight on San Francisco streets, and soon Uber, through a partnership with Lucid and Nuro, will descend on the city as well. It is exactly how San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie likes it.\n\u201cI think we should be the testbed for emerging technology and AI and healthcare tech \u2014 and all of it,\u201d Lurie said Wednesday on the main stage of TechCrunch Disrupt. \u201cWe always have been, and under my leadership, we will continue to lead and lean in.\u201d\nLurie added that he is proud of the success that Waymo, the Alphabet-owned autonomous vehicle tech company, has had in the Bay Area. And, he said \u201cwe welcome others.\u201d\nLurie was quick to say that safety comes first, adding that autonomous vehicles are regulated at the state level. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles. But companies that want to offer and charge for robotaxi rides must also get permits from the California Public Utilities Commission.\nWhile Lurie is opening his arms to autonomous vehicles, other cities are more resistant. Boston, for instance, has considered a ban on autonomous vehicles in the city.\n\u201cWaymo has proven out it is a safe ride,\u201d he said, noting that the robotaxis have attracted tourists who come to the city to take a ride in the driverless vehicles. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping it opens at the airport shortly, and can take people here into the city.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be some resistance. For instance, the Teamsters Union has lobbied for restrictions on self-driving trucks in a bid to protect jobs.\nLurie, meanwhile, has taken a bullish view on tech and the money and jobs it can bring to the city.\n\u201cWe believe in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future starts always in San Francisco, and we\u2019re going to lean into it.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
