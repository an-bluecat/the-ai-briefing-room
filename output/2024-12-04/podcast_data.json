Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday December 5), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI inks deal to upgrade Anduril's anti-drone tech\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI plans to team up with Anduril, the defense startup, to supply its AI tech to systems the U.S. military uses to counter drone attacks.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Anduril will incorporate OpenAI tech into software that assesses and tracks unmanned aircraft. Anduril tells the publication that OpenAI\u2019s models could improve the accuracy and speed of responding to drones, reducing collateral damage.\nOpenAI\u2019s technology won\u2019t be used with Anduril\u2019s other weapons systems as a part of the deal, the companies said.\nAs The WSJ notes, the OpenAI-Anduril tie-up is just the latest example of a major tech company embracing rather than shunning the defense sector. OpenAI previously barred its AI from being used in warfare, but revised that policy in January, and shortly thereafter inked deals with the Pentagon for cybersecurity work and other projects.\nOpenAI has also sought to bring defense leaders into its executive ranks, including former ex-Defense Department official Sasha Baker and NSA chief Paul Nakasone, who sits on OpenAI\u2019s board.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI's active user count soars to 300 million people per week\ndescription1:\nSam Altman, co-founder and C.E.O. of OpenAI, speaks during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center on December 04, 2024 in New York City.\nAfter months of C-suite changes, tender offers and a soaring valuation, OpenAI has reached a new milestone: 300 million weekly active users.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed the new figure Wednesday at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. A source familiar with the company told CNBC last week that the company's weekly active user count was still at 250 million.\nOver the next year, though, the company is reportedly targeting 1 billion active users.\nIt's part of a serious growth plan for OpenAI, as the Microsoft -backed artificial intelligence startup battles Amazon -backed Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI, the latter of which Altman said he views as a \"fierce competitor\" on Wednesday at DealBook. The company is also up against established tech giants like Google, Meta , Microsoft and Amazon for a bigger slice of the generative AI market, which is predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\nOpenAI on Tuesday announced it had hired its first chief marketing officer, nabbing Kate Rouch from crypto company Coinbase \u2014 an indication that it plans to spend more on marketing to grow its user base. In October, OpenAI debuted a search feature within ChatGPT that positions it to better compete with search engines like Google, Microsoft's Bing and Perplexity and may attract more users who otherwise visited those sites to search the web.\nAlso at DealBook on Wednesday, Altman denied reports that the company had asked investors not to also invest in its competitors but said that those who decide to wouldn't have access to OpenAI's \"information rights,\" like the company's roadmap and other materials.\nOpenAI's valuation has climbed to $157 billion in the two years since it launched ChatGPT, raising about $13 billion from Microsoft. The company closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October and received a $4 billion revolving line of credit. As of last week, OpenAI is allowing employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank.\n\ntitle2:\nBitcoin just hit $100,000\ndescription2:\nBitcoin has passed $100,000, marking its highest price since the cryptocurrency launched more than a decade ago, and as of this writing, it has reached $103,359.00, according to Kraken. Despite its triumphs, Bitcoin\u2019s value is still being measured in USD, emerging as an alternate payment option or investment rather than a replacement for fiat currency.\nThe price of Bitcoin spiked following the news that Donald Trump won the 2024 US Presidential Election. Bitcoin sat around $69,000 on Election Day but later shot to $75,000 following the news that Trump won, according to data from CoinDesk. Its price has been rising since, as investors expect a more crypto-friendly environment under the Trump administration.\nRelated How bitcoin grew up and became big money\nThe final push past the $100k mark occurred a few hours after Trump announced several nominations for his administration, which included adding former Republican Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul Atkins as his pick to lead the agency.\nImage: Dune Analytics\nAtkins has served as co-chair of the Chamber of Digital Commerce\u2019s Token Alliance, and Trump said he \u201crecognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nSalesforce stock up on earnings beat and strong AI deals pipeline\ndescription3:\nMarc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, appears on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2024.\nShares of Salesforce popped more than 8% Wednesday, a day after the company reported third-quarter results that exceeded analysts' estimates for revenue and guidance and showed strong promise for its artificial intelligence offerings.\nSalesforce's revenue grew 8% year over year to $9.44 billion in its third quarter, up from the $9.34 billion expected by LSEG. The company's net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.\nSalesforce raised revenue guidance to between $37.8 billion and $38 billion for its fiscal 2025, up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion it had previously reported. The new range puts the midpoint for Salesforce's fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts' expectations.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley reiterated their overweight rating on the stock, stating in a note that \"the force is strong with this one.\" The analysts said they are encouraged by Salesforce's strong start with its artificial intelligence agent, Agentforce, as it closed more than 200 deals during the quarter with \"thousands\" more in the pipeline.\nSalesforce's Agentforce is an example of so-called AI agent technology. Several companies believe these advanced chatbots represent the next logical step from ChatGPT and other related tools powered by large language models.\nGoldman Sachs analysts raised their Salesforce price target from $360 to $400 and reiterated their buy rating on the stock. The analysts said the company's Data Cloud and Agentforce are driving \"notable pipeline generation,\" and they're starting to contribute to the fundamentals of the business.\n\"We believe that Salesforce remains poised to be one of the most strategic application software companies in the $1tn+ TAM cloud industry and is on a path to $50bn in revenue,\" the analysts said in a Tuesday note.\nSimilarly, analysts at Bank of America said Salesforce's third-quarter results suggest it is \"leading the way\" with Agentforce, and they reiterated their buy rating on the stock. The analysts raised their price target to $440 from $390.\nThe analysts said the emerging AI agent product cycle is not derailing Salesforce's margin expansion, and that a meaningful pipeline exists in the service and sales sectors.\n\"Commentary suggests no contribution for Agentforce is assumed in the guide, suggesting early Agentforce deal closure could provide a source of upside,\" they wrote Wednesday.\n--CNBC's Michael Bloom and Jonathan Vanian contributed to this report\n\ntitle4:\nSpotify Wrapped is out. Here's who topped the 2024 streaming charts\ndescription4:\nThis photograph taken in Paris on April 19, 2024, shows a smatphone displaying the US singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's new album \"The Tortured Poets Department\" on Spotify. Queen of pop Taylor Swift released her highly anticipated record \"The Tortured Poets Department\" on April 19, 2024 -- the 11th studio album from the megastar who is already having a blockbuster year.\nSpotify Wrapped 2024 is out, giving hundreds of millions of users the ability to see their most-played songs and artists over the course of the year.\nThe annual report, which allows users to compare their music listening habits with other fans around the world, on Wednesday began rolling out to all users on the streaming platform.\nThis year, Spotify added additional artificial intelligence features to enhance individual users' Wrapped experiences, including personalized AI podcasts about users' music listening histories, a feature powered by Google's NotebookLM and stemming from an expanded partnership between the two companies.\nLast month, Spotify reported earnings that included optimistic profit guidance for the fourth quarter, despite missing analysts' third-quarter targets for both revenue and earnings per share. The company also said it had about 640 million monthly active users on the platform, which slightly surpassed analyst expectations.\nTaylor Swift is Spotify's Global Top Artist for the second year in a row, dominating the most-streamed global albums chart with \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology,\" and Sabrina Carpenter's hit song \"Espresso\" is the most-streamed song both globally and nationally.\nHere are some of this year's chart-toppers:\nMost-streamed songs in the United States\n\"Espresso\" by Sabrina Carpenter \"Not Like Us\" by Kendrick Lamar \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" by Shaboozey \"I Had Some Help (Feat. Morgan Wallen)\" by Post Malone \"MILLION DOLLAR BABY\" by Tommy Richman\nKendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us\" skyrocketed to second-most-streamed song in the country this year. Drake, Lamar's opponent in a renewed public rap battle earlier this spring, surged on the most-streamed artists' list, while Lamar ended up in seventh place on that list.\nMost-streamed artists in the United States\nTaylor Swift Drake Zach Bryan Morgan Wallen Kanye West\n\"The Joe Rogan Experience,\" which hosted President-elect Donald Trump in October, took the No. 1 spot for top podcasts worldwide. \"Call Her Daddy,\" which hosted Vice President Kamala Harris that same month, took second place.\nBoth appearances represented a distinct shift in presidential campaigning strategies toward non-legacy-media outlets, reaching millions of weekly listeners.\"\n\nResponse:",
