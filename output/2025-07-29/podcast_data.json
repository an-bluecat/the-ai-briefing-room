Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Groq previously raised about $1 billion.\nThe new round is led by Austin-based firm Disruptive, Bloomberg reports. The November round was led by BlackRock, with participation from Neuberger Berman, Type One Ventures, Cisco, KDDI, and Samsung Catalyst Fund.\nGroq was founded by Jonathan Ross, who previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip. The startup emerged from stealth in 2016.\nThis new raise comes after Groq announced in May an exclusive partnership with Bell Canada to power the telco\u2019s large AI infrastructure project. In April, Groq partnered with Meta to offer AI infrastructure to speed Llama 4 inference. Neither Disruptive nor Groq immediately returned our request for comment.\nCorrection: This story originally incorrectly reported the date of the last raise.\n\ntitle1:\nAnthropic reportedly nears $170B valuation with potential $5B round\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nAnthropic is nearing a deal to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion in funding, valuing the large language model developer at $170 billion, Bloomberg reported.\nIconiq Capital is leading this funding round, but there\u2019s a possibility of a second lead investor joining the deal. The company has also been in talks with Qatar Investment Authority and GIC, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, according to the report.\nIf finalized, the deal would nearly triple Anthropic\u2019s valuation, which was $61.5 billion after a $3.5 billion funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners announced in March. Other participants in the startup\u2019s last round included Bessemer Venture Partners, Cisco Investments, D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management & Research Company, General Catalyst, Jane Street, Menlo Ventures, and Salesforce Ventures.\nDespite Anthropic\u2019s mission as a safety-conscious AI model developer, the company\u2019s CEO, Dario Amodei, recently confessed in a memo to employees, reported by Wired, that he\u2019s \u201cnot thrilled\u201d about taking money from sovereign wealth funds of dictatorial governments.\nTo keep pace with the massive capital requirements of developing AI models, the company has been forced to turn to Middle Eastern capital.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I think \u2018No bad person should ever benefit from our success\u2019 is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on,\u201d Amodei wrote in a leaked memo.\nAnthropic didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle2:\nSpace Force bets on commercial entrants in $4B satcom contest\ndescription2:\nAmerican warfighters need jam-proof communications, and the Space Force is planning to spend hundreds of millions to ensure they have them.\nAs part of that effort, the service established the Protected Tactical Satcom program to build out secure battlefield communications via satellites. The Space Force has already awarded contracts to defense primes Boeing and Northrop Grumman to develop prototype payloads for satellites heading to far-away geostationary orbit.\nNow, the program is entering a new phase. On Tuesday, the Space Force awarded five additional contracts for the design and demonstration of purpose-built satellites to provide jam-resistant comms to tactical forces. The winners include previous winners Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Viasat, and Intelsat, plus a relative newcomer: Astranis, a venture-backed startup based in San Francisco. (Intelsat will buy its satellite bus from K2 Space, another venture-backed startup.)\nThe initial awards are relatively small, totaling $37.3 million combined. But the program has a $4 billion award ceiling, so the winners could sign on to a much more lucrative defense deal.\nEach firm will develop its architectures through January 2026. After that, the Space Force will select one design and award an additional contract for the first satellite, with a launch planned in 2028. Additional production awards will be doled out, also in 2028.\nThe PTS-G contracts are a notable departure from how the military has historically procured geostationary satellites, which have typically had extremely long timelines from contract award to launch, and would cost hundreds of millions to over a billion dollars per spacecraft.\nIn contrast, the Space Force is clearly trying to leverage the speed of commercial entrants and encourage competition by selecting multiple vendors for the initial phase of the program.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

With Study Mode enabled, ChatGPT will ask users questions to test their understanding and, in some cases, refuse to offer direct answers unless students engage with the material.\nOpenAI says Study Mode is rolling out to logged in users on ChatGPT\u2019s Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans starting Tuesday. The company expects to introduce Study Mode to its Edu subscribers, which largely consists of young people whose school administrator\u2019s have purchased a plan for the entire student body, in the coming weeks.\nStudy Mode is OpenAI\u2019s attempt to address the millions of students who use ChatGPT in school. Studies have shown that using ChatGPT can be a helpful tutor for young people, but it also may harm their critical thinking skills. A research paper released in June found that people who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the process compared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.\nWhen ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023, some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people\u2019s lives from now on.\nNow with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude, called Learning Mode, in April.\nOf course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI\u2019s VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing that the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.\nThat means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode \u2014 the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Now, Spotify is teasing that generative AI advances may pave the way for an even more conversational interface with the streaming service in the future, according to comments made during Spotify\u2019s second-quarter earnings call with investors on Tuesday.\nAsked about how AI was affecting its business, Spotify Chief Product and Technology Officer Gustav S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m noted that consumers today are able to talk to Spotify in plain English to request music, allowing the company to associate which phrases connect with which songs.\n\u201cYou can think of it as us getting a new dataset,\u201d he said. \u201cSpotify\u2019s got this unique dataset from all of its playlists, which was really song-to-song \u2014 like which song goes well with another song, kind of the Amazon \u2018people who bought this also bought that,\u2019\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the voice interface is delivering new insights to the company.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s completely new to us, and it\u2019s a very, very valuable dataset that we are collecting very quickly,\u201d he added.\nAs a result, the exec says we can expect Spotify\u2019s consumer experiences to get \u201cmuch more interactive.\u201d\n\u201cYou can already write to Spotify, talk to Spotify. You\u2019re just going to see that expand,\u201d S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m said.\nPlus, AI technology would allow Spotify to do more than just predict what someone might want to listen to, whether music, podcasts, or audiobooks, as it does today. Instead of only making predictions, it would be able to \u201creason\u201d over the user\u2019s listening history and what they said to the AI DJ. The reference to reasoning suggests that Spotify is looking toward AI reasoning models that can perform more complex tasks across multiple steps.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe voice data in question comes from Spotify\u2019s AI DJ feature. In May 2025, Spotify introduced a way for Premium subscribers to make voice requests to the English-language AI DJ by pressing a button in the app. This lets users change the music, the genre, or the mood of a playlist using a voice command.\nConsumer features aren\u2019t the only way Spotify is leveraging AI. During the call, the exec also mentioned that Spotify is using generative AI internally to more rapidly prototype products and create efficiencies in other areas of its business, like finance.\nIn the quarter, Spotify hit 276 million paying subscribers, up 12% year-over-year, and 696 million monthly active users, but swung to a loss after missing revenue targets.
