    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday April 21), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nEverything you need to know about the AI chatbot\ndescription0:\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it\u2019s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\nTo see a list of 2024 updates, go here.\nApril 2025\nOpenAI could \u201cadjust\u201d its safeguards if rivals release \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if \u201canother frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.\u201d The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\nOpenAI is building its own social media network\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s X and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\nOpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI\u2019s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\nOpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities\nOpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model \u2014 GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano \u2014 with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It\u2019s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek\u2019s upgraded V3.\nOpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-4 at the end of April\nOpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI\u2019s API.\nOpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon\nOpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\nOpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\nOpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT\nIt looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new \u201cImageGen\u201d watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT\u2019s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: \u201cStructured Thoughts,\u201d \u201cReasoning Recap,\u201d \u201cCoT Search Tool,\u201d and \u201cl1239dk1.\u201d\nOpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students\nOpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI\u2019s premium service, which offers access to the company\u2019s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\nChatGPT users have generated over 700M images so far\nMore than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI\u2019s o3 \u201creasoning\u201d model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company\u2019s new image-generation tool\u2019s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. \u201cWe are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,\u201d he wrote.\nMarch 2025\nOpenAI plans to release a new \u2018open\u2019 AI language model\nOpeanAI intends to release its \u201cfirst\u201d open language model since GPT-2 \u201cin the coming months.\u201d The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT\u2019s restrictions on image generation\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now \u201cevolved\u201d its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI\u2019s model behavior.\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic\u2019s standard for linking AI models with data\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\nOpenAI\u2019s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cSpirited Away.\u201d The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn\u2019t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT\u2019s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI\u2019s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company\u2019s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company\u2019s API service. The company\u2019s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s chief operating officer, will lead the company\u2019s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\nOpenAI\u2019s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company\u2019s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT\u2019s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are \u201cmore direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,\u201d a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.\nOpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India\nOpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI\u2019s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot\u2019s defamatory hallucinations\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. \u201cThe GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,\u201d said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn\u2019t enough. You can\u2019t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\u201d\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \u201cgpt-4o-mini-tts,\u201d that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \u201cgpt-4o-transcribe\u201d and \u201cgpt-4o-mini-transcribe\u201d. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model to deliver \u201cconsistently better responses.\u201d It\u2019s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI \u201creasoning\u201d models could\u2019ve arrived decades ago\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \u201creasoning\u201d could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \u201cnew model\u201d that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \u201cPlease write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\u201d OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\nwe trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.\nPROMPT:\nPlease write a metafictional literary short story\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI \u2018agents\u2019\nOpenAI intends to release several \u201cagent\u201d products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \u201chigh-income knowledge worker\u201d agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \u201cPhD-level research,\u201d are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It\u2019s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\nChatGPT can directly edit your code\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\nChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model\u2019s launch.\nFebruary 2025\nOpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a \u2018unified\u2019 next-gen release\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \u201csimplified\u201d product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \u201cintegrates a lot of [OpenAI\u2019s] technology,\u201d including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI\u2019s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model\u2019s thought process\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \u201cthought\u201d process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \u201cchain of thought\u201d that shows more of the model\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot\u2019s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for \u2018deep research\u2019\nOpenAI announced a new AI \u201cagent\u201d called deep research that\u2019s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the \u201cagent\u201d is intended for instances where you don\u2019t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\nJanuary 2025\nOpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user\u2019s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models\u2019 responses to human replies for that same post.\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest \u2018reasoning\u2019 model\nOpenAI launched a new AI \u201creasoning\u201d model, o3-mini, the newest in the company\u2019s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201caffordable.\u201d\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are 85% male, report says\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech\u2019s faults\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\nOperator, OpenAI\u2019s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT\u2019s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren\u2019t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT\u2019s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI\u2019s website.\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number \u2014 no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can\u2019t upgrade to one of OpenAI\u2019s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn\u2019t supported without a valid email.\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\nChatGPT\u2019s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like \u2018chatty\u2019 and \u2018Gen Z\u2019\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \u201ctraits\u201d they\u2019d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \u201cChatty,\u201d \u201cEncouraging,\u201d and \u201cGen Z.\u201d However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it\u2019s possible they went live prematurely.\nFAQs:\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\nWho uses ChatGPT?\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\nYes.\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI's new reasoning AI models hallucinate more\ndescription1:\nOpenAI\u2019s recently launched o3 and o4-mini AI models are state-of-the-art in many respects. However, the new models still hallucinate, or make things up \u2014 in fact, they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI\u2019s older models.\nHallucinations have proven to be one of the biggest and most difficult problems to solve in AI, impacting even today\u2019s best-performing systems. Historically, each new model has improved slightly in the hallucination department, hallucinating less than its predecessor. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case for o3 and o4-mini.\nAccording to OpenAI\u2019s internal tests, o3 and o4-mini, which are so-called reasoning models, hallucinate more often than the company\u2019s previous reasoning models \u2014 o1, o1-mini, and o3-mini \u2014 as well as OpenAI\u2019s traditional, \u201cnon-reasoning\u201d models, such as GPT-4o.\nPerhaps more concerning, the ChatGPT maker doesn\u2019t really know why it\u2019s happening.\nIn its technical report for o3 and o4-mini, OpenAI writes that \u201cmore research is needed\u201d to understand why hallucinations are getting worse as it scales up reasoning models. O3 and o4-mini perform better in some areas, including tasks related to coding and math. But because they \u201cmake more claims overall,\u201d they\u2019re often led to make \u201cmore accurate claims as well as more inaccurate/hallucinated claims,\u201d per the report.\nOpenAI found that o3 hallucinated in response to 33% of questions on PersonQA, the company\u2019s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model\u2019s knowledge about people. That\u2019s roughly double the hallucination rate of OpenAI\u2019s previous reasoning models, o1 and o3-mini, which scored 16% and 14.8%, respectively. O4-mini did even worse on PersonQA \u2014 hallucinating 48% of the time.\nThird-party testing by Transluce, a nonprofit AI research lab, also found evidence that o3 has a tendency to make up actions it took in the process of arriving at answers. In one example, Transluce observed o3 claiming that it ran code on a 2021 MacBook Pro \u201coutside of ChatGPT,\u201d then copied the numbers into its answer. While o3 has access to some tools, it can\u2019t do that.\n\u201cOur hypothesis is that the kind of reinforcement learning used for o-series models may amplify issues that are usually mitigated (but not fully erased) by standard post-training pipelines,\u201d said Neil Chowdhury, a Transluce researcher and former OpenAI employee, in an email to TechCrunch.\nSarah Schwettmann, co-founder of Transluce, added that o3\u2019s hallucination rate may make it less useful than it otherwise would be.\nKian Katanforoosh, a Stanford adjunct professor and CEO of the upskilling startup Workera, told TechCrunch that his team is already testing o3 in their coding workflows, and that they\u2019ve found it to be a step above the competition. However, Katanforoosh says that o3 tends to hallucinate broken website links. The model will supply a link that, when clicked, doesn\u2019t work.\nHallucinations may help models arrive at interesting ideas and be creative in their \u201cthinking,\u201d but they also make some models a tough sell for businesses in markets where accuracy is paramount. For example, a law firm likely wouldn\u2019t be pleased with a model that inserts lots of factual errors into client contracts.\nOne promising approach to boosting the accuracy of models is giving them web search capabilities. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o with web search achieves 90% accuracy on SimpleQA, another one of OpenAI\u2019s accuracy benchmarks. Potentially, search could improve reasoning models\u2019 hallucination rates, as well \u2014 at least in cases where users are willing to expose prompts to a third-party search provider.\nIf scaling up reasoning models indeed continues to worsen hallucinations, it\u2019ll make the hunt for a solution all the more urgent.\n\u201cAddressing hallucinations across all our models is an ongoing area of research, and we\u2019re continually working to improve their accuracy and reliability,\u201d said OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix in an email to TechCrunch.\nIn the last year, the broader AI industry has pivoted to focus on reasoning models after techniques to improve traditional AI models started showing diminishing returns. Reasoning improves model performance on a variety of tasks without requiring massive amounts of computing and data during training. Yet it seems reasoning also may lead to more hallucinating \u2014 presenting a challenge.\n\ntitle2:\nTechstars increases startup funding to $220,000, mirroring YC structure\ndescription2:\nTechstars, a nearly 20-year-old startup accelerator, announced new terms for startups that enter its three-month program. The organization will now invest $220,000, which is $100,000 more than it offered previously, in companies starting with its fall 2025 batch.\nThe capital will be divided into two components. The group is offering companies $20,000 in exchange for 5% ownership in the business. Startups will also receive $200,000 in the form of an uncapped SAFE note with a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clause. Put more simply, Techstars\u2019 percentage ownership of its $200,000 SAFE will depend on the company\u2019s subsequent valuations. For example, if the startup\u2019s next financing \u201cprices\u201d it at $10 million, Techstars will receive 2% equity on the SAFE component for a total of 7% ownership.\nTechstars\u2019 new terms now closely mirror those of Y Combinator. The famed Silicon Valley accelerator increased its funding to startups three years ago by adding a $375,000 SAFE note to its standard deal of $125,000 for 7% of the startup\u2019s equity.\nSo, which accelerator is offering a better deal for startups? The answer largely depends on the company\u2019s capital needs. Compared to Techstars, startups going through YC get more than double the funding but give up more equity.\n\ntitle4:\nBluesky may soon add blue check verification\ndescription4:\nBluesky may soon get a new blue checkmark verification system, according to changes to the app\u2019s public GitHub repository spotted Friday by reverse engineer alice.mosphere.at.\nThe blue checks may have a similar look to the system pioneered by Twitter, now X, but Bluesky\u2019s version seems like it will work quite differently.\nBluesky\u2019s blue check system may rely on multiple organizations to distribute blue checks, according to the codebase changes. That suggests Bluesky will actively verify notable accounts, but also label certain organizations as \u201ctrusted verifiers,\u201d and give them the authority to directly issue blue checks themselves.\nThe changes to Bluesky\u2019s verification system may be announced as soon as Monday, according to a blog post link found in Friday\u2019s pull request titled \u201cverification,\u201d which is dated for April 21, 2025.\nWhile Bluesky already lets users verify themselves by tying their accounts to official websites, CEO Jay Graber has hinted the company would try other types of verification. Last year, Graber said Bluesky may experiment with a system where it\u2019s not the only group that can verify users.\nThe pull request also shows an icon, a blue circle containing a white checkmark, that will appear on verified users\u2019 profiles. Meanwhile, trusted verifiers will have scalloped blue circles containing a white checkmark on their profiles.\nA blog spotted in Bluesky\u2019s github repo posted by an occasional reverse engineer Image Credits:alice.mosphere.at\nAn image spotted in Bluesky\u2019s forthcoming announcement suggests The New York Times, and other trusted news publishers, may soon have the ability to verify users in the blue check system. By tapping on a user\u2019s blue check, other users can see which organizations have granted verification, according to the changes.\nHow the verification system will work Image Credits:alice.mosphere.at\nBluesky\u2019s approach to verification is a lot different from how X operates its verification services. While X used to distribute blue checks to popular, authentic accounts, Elon Musk decided to overhaul the system and only verifies users who pay a monthly subscription. Musk has since walked back that decision, giving blue checks to some influential users that don\u2019t pay for it, while still allowing other people to pay for it.\nSome have argued that X has diluted the value of a blue check on its platform altogether, even allowing some bot accounts to be verified.\nBluesky did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nBluesky seems to be taking a decentralized approach to verification by spreading out the decision-making power to several organizations. That could mean a lot of users on Bluesky are getting verified, but it remains to be seen how this approach will work in practice.\"\n\nResponse:",
