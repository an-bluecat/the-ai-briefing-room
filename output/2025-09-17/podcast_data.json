Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

At that time, reports suggested that the raise would be about $600 million, at near a $6 billion valuation.\nGroq, which also sells data center computing power, previously raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation in August 2024, making this more than double the valuation in about a year. Groq has now raised over $3 billion to date, PitchBook estimates.\nGroq has been a hot commodity because it is working on breaking the chokehold that AI chip maker Nvidia has over the tech industry. Groq\u2019s chips are not GPUs, the graphics processing units that typically power AI systems. Instead, Groq calls them LPUs, (language processing units) and calls its hardware an inference engine \u2014 specialized computers optimized for running AI models quickly and efficiently.\nIts products are geared toward developers and enterprises, available as either a cloud service or an on-premises hardware cluster. The on-prem hardware is a server rack outfitted with a stack of its integrated hardware/software nodes. Both the cloud and on-prem hardware run open versions of popular models, like those from Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Google and OpenAI. Groq says its offerings maintain, or in some cases improve, AI performance at significantly less cost than alternatives.\nGroq\u2019s founder, Jonathan Ross, has a particularly relevant pedigree for this work. Ross previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip, which are specialized processors designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU was announced in 2016, the same year Groq emerged from stealth. TPUs still power Google Cloud\u2019s AI services.\nGroq says it now powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from 356,000 developers when the company talked to TechCrunch a year ago.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Existing investors, including Samsung, Cisco, D1, and Altimeter, also joined the round.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta launches Hyperscape, technology to turn real-world spaces into VR\ndescription1:\nAlthough today\u2019s Meta Connect developer conference was largely about new smart glasses, the social networking company did announce a handful of metaverse updates during Wednesday\u2019s keynote. Of these, one of the largest was the introduction of Hyperscape, first demoed at last year\u2019s event, which allows developers and creators to build more photorealistic spaces in virtual reality.\nThe company announced that Hyperscape Capture is now rolling out in Early Access, meaning Quest device owners will be able to scan a room in a few minutes, then turn it into an immersive and photorealistic world that\u2019s like a digital replica of a real-world space.\nThe capture process itself only takes a few minutes, but the room\u2019s rendering will actually take a few hours, Meta notes.\nAt launch, users won\u2019t be able to invite others into their digital spaces, though that functionality will be supported in time, Meta says, through a private link.\nImage Credits:Meta\nHowever, the tech has already been used to render some featured Hyperscape worlds, including Gordon Ramsay\u2019s home kitchen in L.A., Chance the Rapper\u2019s House of Kicks, The Octagon at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, and Happy Kelli\u2019s room filled with her Crocs shoe collection.\nMeta first demoed Hyperscape last year at its Connect conference, showing how it used Gaussian Splatting, cloud rendering, and streaming to make the digital worlds appear on a Meta Quest 3 headset. Now, it\u2019s rolling it out to users 18 years old and up, who have either a Quest 3 or Quest 3S.\nThe rollout will be gradual, starting today, so not all users may see it immediately.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The smart glasses are controlled by a wristband that picks up on subtle hand gestures, called Meta Neural Band, the same one it unveiled at last year\u2019s Connect as part of its Orion demo.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the new product, called Meta Ray-Ban Display, onstage at the company\u2019s annual developer conference, Meta Connect 2025. Unlike Orion, Zuckerberg says this is a product that people can buy in a couple of weeks, starting September 30, and they\u2019ll cost $799.\nThis is Meta\u2019s latest attempt to ship a pair of consumer smart glasses that can handle many of the tasks users traditionally do on a smartphone. For years, Meta has been forced to reach users through its competitors\u2019 devices, namely those sold by Google and Apple. While Meta has invested billions in virtual reality headsets, AI-powered smart glasses now seem like the most promising way for the company to connect with users on its own hardware.\nWith the Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta aims to build off the success of its original Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which the company has sold millions of pairs of with its eyewear partner, EssilorLuxottica. Much like Ray-Ban Meta, the Meta Ray-Ban Display comes equipped with an on-board AI assistant, as well as cameras, speakers, and microphones. The glasses let users connect to the cloud to access the internet and social media apps.\n(Credit: Meta) Image Credits:Meta\nMeta says the display enables users to do much more with their smart glasses. Users are capable of displaying Meta apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. Users can also view directions and see live translations in the smart glasses\u2019 display.\nThe Neural Band that ships alongside the device looks similar to a Fitbit, but without a screen, and allows users to navigate apps with small hand movements. Zuckerberg said onstage that the Meta Neural Band has 18 hours of battery life and is water resistant.\nThe device uses electromyography (EMG) to pick up on signals sent between your brain and your hand when performing a gesture. Meta is betting this interface will be a new way users can control their devices.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n(Credit: Meta) Image Credits:Meta\nEarlier this week, a video leaked of Meta\u2019s latest smart glasses. CNBC and Bloomberg previously reported that the smart glasses, which were internally codenamed Hypernova, would be unveiled at this year\u2019s Connect conference.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Meta Ray-Ban Display are far less capable than the Orion smart glasses Meta showed off at Connect 2024. That device featured augmented reality lenses and eye tracking, while this pair uses a much simpler display. It may be years before Meta ever sells Orion.\nStill, Meta is hoping it can win the smart glasses race by being first to market with a real product. However, it seems likely that Google and Apple will launch smart glasses of their own in the years to come. Those devices will undoubtedly be able to integrate into Google and Apple\u2019s respective operating systems, giving them a significant leg up over Meta.\n\ntitle3:\nTesla is redesigning its door handles following safety probe, Bloomberg investigation\ndescription3:\nTesla is \u201cworking on\u201d redesigning its door handles so they are less likely to trap people inside the company\u2019s cars, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen told Bloomberg News on Wednesday.\nThe news comes just one day after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an probe into Tesla\u2019s door handles, and one week after a Bloomberg News investigation highlighted multiple instances where owners or passengers were stuck in their cars following a crash.\nVon Holzhausen didn\u2019t specify when Tesla made the decision to rethink how its door handles work, according to Bloomberg. China has already been pushing automakers to reconsider the use of fully concealed door handles because of safety concerns, although the country\u2019s top regulator has not taken a final action.\nOne of the two apparent problems with Tesla\u2019s door handles has been they use electronic locks, which can stop working if they aren\u2019t receiving power from the car\u2019s battery system. The other is that, while Tesla does have manual door releases built into its cars, they are often hard to find and difficult to access.\n\u201cThe idea of combining the electronic one and the manual one together into one button, I think, makes a lot of sense,\u201d von Holzhausen told Bloomberg. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we\u2019re working on.\u201d\nNHTSA opened its investigation on Tuesday after the agency said it had received nine complaints from Tesla owners who experienced a failure with their door handles. In four of those cases, the safety agency said the owners had to break a window \u201cto regain entry into the vehicle.\u201d\nTesla includes instructions in its owner\u2019s manuals that describe how to use an outside power source to activate dead electronic door locks, as both NHTSA and Bloomberg have noted. But NHTSA noted in its preliminary report that none of the owners who contacted the agency reported seeing low-voltage battery warnings \u2014 meaning they likely would not have known what was causing the problem.\n\ntitle4:\nIrregular raises $80 million to secure frontier AI models\ndescription4:\nOn Wednesday, AI security firm Irregular announced $80 million in new funding in a round led by Sequoia Capital and Redpoint Ventures, with participation from Wiz CEO Assaf Rappaport. A source close to the deal said the round valued Irregular at $450 million.\n\u201cOur view is that soon, a lot of economic activity is going to come from human-on-AI interaction and AI-on-AI interaction,\u201d co-founder Dan Lahav told TechCrunch, \u201cand that\u2019s going to break the security stack along multiple points.\u201d\nFormerly known as Pattern Labs, Irregular is already a significant player in AI evaluations. The company\u2019s work is cited in security evaluations for Claude 3.7 Sonnet as well as OpenAI\u2019s o3 and o4-mini models. More generally, the company\u2019s framework for scoring a model\u2019s vulnerability-detection ability (dubbed SOLVE) is widely used within the industry.\nWhile Irregular has done significant work on models\u2019 existing risks, the company is fundraising with an eye towards something even more ambitious: spotting emergent risks and behaviors before they surface in the wild. The company has constructed an elaborate system of simulated environments, enabling intensive testing of a model before it is released.\n\u201cWe have complex network simulations where we have AI both taking the role of attacker and defender,\u201d says co-founder Omer Nevo. \u201cSo when a new model comes out, we can see where the defenses hold up and where they don\u2019t.\u201d\nSecurity has become a point of intense focus for the AI industry, as the potential risks posed by frontier models as more risks have emerged. OpenAI overhauled its internal security measures this summer, with an eye towards potential corporate espionage.\nAt the same time, AI models are increasingly adept at finding software vulnerabilities \u2014 a power with serious implications for both attackers and defenders.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
