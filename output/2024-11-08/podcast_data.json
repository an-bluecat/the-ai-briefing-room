The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

As this is the first election in which AI chatbots played a significant part of voters\u2019 information diets, even approximate numbers are interesting to think about. For instance, OpenAI has stated that it told around 2 million users of ChatGPT to go look somewhere else.\nIt didn\u2019t just give them a cold shoulder, but recommended some trusted news sources like Reuters and the Associated Press. ChatGPT gave this type of \u201cI\u2019m just an AI, go read the actual news\u201d response over 2 million times on Election Day and the day after, OpenAI explained in an update to a blog post on its elections approach.\nIn the month leading up to election, ChatGPT sent around a million people to CanIVote.org when they asked questions specific to voting. And interestingly, it also rejected some 250,000 requests to generate images of the candidates over the same period.\nFor comparison, Perplexity, the AI search engine, made a major push to promote its own election information hub, resulting in some 4 million page views, the company claimed (per Bloomberg).\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether these numbers are low or high. Certainly they are nowhere near leaders in the news: CNN\u2019s digital properties saw around 67 million unique visitors on Election Day and a similar amount the day after.\nBut traffic is a tricky metric at the best of times. What matters this year is not that CNN got 10 times the traffic as these two AI platforms put together, but that it got only 10 times the traffic. Millions of people were interested enough, and trusted AI companies enough, to at least ask or give their election knowledge a shot.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s play was the safe one, and Perplexity may have pulled off a risky bet, the AI industry in general is probably ecstatic about the fact that there was no serious gaffe by any of the big brands (except xAI, of course) and that users considered these chatbots and AI-powered platforms valuable as Election Day resources.\nLuckily for them, this particular election, though controversial in its own way, was relatively decisive and resulted in very few grey areas like disputed results, recounts, and lawsuits. If the 2020 election had occurred this week, they may not have fared so well.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Before this week's rally, shares of the carmaker were up about 1% for the year. Tesla's stock is now up about 30% year to date.\nThe company's stock has rallied about 29% this week after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election and investors have grown optimistic that the former leader's return to the White House could benefit Tesla. Elon Musk , Tesla's CEO, has been a key ally for Trump throughout his campaign, pouring at least $130 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort.\nTesla rejoins a growing club of tech names that are now worth more than $1 trillion, including Nvidia , Apple , Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon and Meta (though all but Meta are worth more than $2 trillion). Tesla's market cap first crossed the $1 trillion mark in October 2021.\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said that a potential Trump administration could spell less regulation for Tesla and other companies.\n\"Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players (BYD, Nio, etc.) from flooding the U.S. market over the coming years,\" Ives wrote in a note to clients this week.\nTrump has said previously he may cut the federal $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Those credits have helped to drive sales of Tesla vehicles historically.\nIn its most recent earnings update, Tesla reported revenue of $25.18 billion and net income of $2.17 billion in the third quarter.\nCEO Musk said on the earnings call that his \"best guess\" was that \"vehicle growth\" would reach 20% to 30% next year, due to \"lower cost vehicles\" and the \"advent of autonomy.\"\nTesla has been promising, and developing, driverless vehicle technology for more than a decade. Its key U.S. competitor, Alphabet-owned Waymo, has pulled ahead and is already operating commercial robotaxi services in several major cities.\nOn the third-quarter call, Musk said he would use his sway with a Trump-Vance administration to establish a \"federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.\" Currently, approvals happen at the state level, which the CEO sees as a regulatory hurdle Tesla will need to overcome once it finally offers more than partially automated driving systems.\n\u2014 CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the year Tesla's market cap crossed $1 trillion for the first time. Tesla's net income was $2.17 billion in the third quarter.

SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nSamsung Electronics was once the dominant player in a type of semiconductor known as memory, putting it in a great position to capitalize on the boom of artificial intelligence. But the South Korea electronics giant has now fallen behind its long-time rival SK Hynix in next-generation chips that have been key component for AI silicon leader Nvidia . The result? Samsung's profit has plunged, around $126 billion has been wiped off its market value, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and an executive issued a rare public apology about the company's recent financial performance. Memory is a critical type of chip used to store data, and it can be found in a plethora of devices from smartphones to laptops. For years, Samsung was the undeniable leader in this technology, ahead of South Korean rival SK Hynix and U.S. competitor Micron . But as AI applications such as OpenAI's ChatGPT rose in popularity, the underlying infrastructure required to train the huge models they rely on became a bigger focus. Nvidia has emerged as the top player in this space with its graphics processing units (GPUs) that have become the gold standard used by tech giants for AI training.\nA crucial part of that semiconductor architecture is high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. This next generation of memory involves stacking multiple dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, but it had a small market before the AI boom. That's where Samsung got caught out and failed to invest. \"HBM has been a very niche product ... for a long time and Samsung has not focused its resources on its development,\" Kazunori Ito, director of equity research at Morningstar, told CNBC by email. \"Due to the difficulty of the technology involved in stacking DRAMs and the small size of the addressable market, it was believed that the high development costs were not justified.\" SK Hynix saw this opportunity. The company aggressively launched HBM chips which were approved for use in Nvidia architecture and, in the process, the South Korean firm established a close relationship with the U.S. giant. Nvidia's CEO even asked the company to speed up supply of its next generation chip, underscoring the importance of HBM to its products. SK Hynix posted record quarterly operating profit in the September quarter. \"With strong R&D (research and development) investments and established industry partnerships, SK Hynix maintains an edge in both HBM innovation and market penetration,\" Brady Wang, associated director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC by email. Samsung told CNBC that, in the third quarter, total HBM sales grew more than 70% quarter-on-quarter. The tech giant added that the current product known as HBM3E is in mass production and generating sales. The South Korean tech company noted that development for its next-generation HBM4 is \"underway according to plan\" and that the company is targeting starting \"mass production\" in the second half of 2025.\nCan Samsung make a comeback?\nAnalysts said that Samsung is lagging behind competitors for a number of reasons, including underinvestment in HBM and the fact that it is not a first-mover. \"It is fair to say that Samsung has not been able to close the gap with SK Hynix on the HBM development roadmap,\" Morningstar's Ito said.\nwatch now\n\ntitle3:\nFBI says hackers are sending fraudulent police data requests to tech giants to steal people's private information\ndescription3:\nThe FBI is warning that hackers are obtaining private user information \u2014 including emails and phone numbers \u2014 from U.S.-based tech companies by compromising government and police email addresses to submit \u201cemergency\u201d data requests.\nThe FBI\u2019s public notice filed this week is a rare admission from the federal government about the threat from fraudulent emergency data requests, a legal process designed to help police and federal authorities obtain information from companies to respond to immediate threats affecting someone\u2019s life or property. The abuse of emergency data requests is not new, and has been widely reported in recent years. Now, the FBI warns that it saw an \u201cuptick\u201d around August in criminal posts online advertising access to or conducting fraudulent emergency data requests, and that it was going public for awareness.\n\u201cCyber-criminals are likely gaining access to compromised US and foreign government email addresses and using them to conduct fraudulent emergency data requests to US based companies, exposing the personal information of customers to further use for criminal purposes,\u201d reads the FBI\u2019s advisory.\nPolice and law enforcement in the U.S. generally need some kind of legal justification to seek and obtain access to private data that companies store on their servers. Typically for a person\u2019s private content, like their files, emails, or messages, police need to provide enough evidence of a possible crime before a U.S. court will issue a search warrant allowing the police to request that information from a private company. Police can issue subpoenas \u2014 which don\u2019t require going to a court \u2014 requesting companies to access limited amounts of information about a user, such as their basic account information, like their username, account logins, email addresses, and phone numbers, and sometimes their approximate location.\nThere are also emergency requests, a procedure in which law enforcement can urgently seek a person\u2019s information from a company in the event of an immediate risk, where there is no time to seek a court order.\nIt\u2019s these emergency requests that federal authorities say some cybercriminals are abusing.\nThe FBI said in its advisory that it had seen several public posts made by known cybercriminals over 2023 and 2024, claiming access to email addresses used by U.S. law enforcement and some foreign governments. The FBI says this access was ultimately used to send fraudulent subpoenas and other legal demands to U.S. companies seeking private user data stored on their systems.\nThe advisory said that the cybercriminals were successful in masquerading as law enforcement by using compromised police accounts to send emails to companies requesting user data. In some cases, the requests cited false threats, like claims of human trafficking and, in one case, that an individual would \u201csuffer greatly or die\u201d unless the company in question returns the requested information.\nThe FBI said the compromised access to law enforcement accounts allowed the hackers to generate legitimate-looking subpoenas that resulted in companies turning over usernames, emails, phone numbers, and other private information about their users. But not all fraudulent attempts to file emergency data requests were successful, the FBI said.\nCybercriminals often use the requested data for harassment, doxing, and targeting individuals with financial fraud schemes, according to a Bloomberg report from 2022, which found at the time that hackers had obtained user information from customers of Apple, and Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta, by filing fraudulent emergency data requests. Snap, the maker of Snapchat, and Discord were also reportedly targeted.\nApple, Google, Meta, and Snap, which store huge amounts of customers\u2019 personal and private data, collectively receive tens of thousands of emergency data requests every year.\nBloomberg reported in 2022 that some of the fraudulent emergency data requests date as far back as early 2021, and were carried out by groups of mostly teenagers and young adults, such as Recursion Team, and later, Lapsus$, which went on to hack into some of the world\u2019s largest companies, including Uber.\nThe FBI said in its advisory that law enforcement organizations should take steps to improve their cybersecurity posture to prevent intrusions, including stronger passwords and multi-factor authentication. The FBI said that private companies \u201cshould apply critical thinking to any emergency data requests received,\u201d given that cybercriminals \u201cunderstand the need for exigency.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI loses another lead safety researcher, Lilian Weng\ndescription4:\nAnother one of OpenAI\u2019s lead safety researchers, Lilian Weng, announced on Friday she is departing the startup. Weng served as VP of research and safety since August, and before that, was the head of the OpenAI\u2019s safety systems team.\nIn a post on X, Weng said that \u201cafter 7 years at OpenAI, I feel ready to reset and explore something new.\u201d Weng said her last day will be November 15th, but did not specify where she will go next.\n\u201cI made the extremely difficult decision to leave OpenAI,\u201d said Weng in the post. \u201cLooking at what we have achieved, I\u2019m so proud of everyone on the Safety Systems team and I have extremely high confidence that the team will continue thriving.\u201d\nWeng\u2019s departure marks the latest in a long string of AI safety researchers, policy researchers, and other executives who have exited the company in the last year, and several have accused OpenAI of prioritizing commercial products over AI safety. Weng joins Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike \u2013 the leaders of OpenAI\u2019s now dissolved Superalignment team, which tried to develop methods to steer superintelligent AI systems \u2013 who also left the startup this year to work on AI safety elsewhere.\nWeng first joined OpenAI in 2018, according to her LinkedIn, working on the startup\u2019s robotics team that ended up building a robot hand that could solve a Rubik\u2019s cube \u2013 a task that took two years to achieve, according to her post.\nAs OpenAI started focusing more on the GPT paradigm, so did Weng. The researcher transitioned to help build the startup\u2019s applied AI research team in 2021. Following the launch of GPT-4, Weng was tasked with creating a dedicated team to build safety systems for the startup in 2023. Today, OpenAI\u2019s safety systems unit has more than 80 scientists, researchers, and policy experts, according to Weng\u2019s post.\nThat\u2019s a lot of AI safety folks, but many have raised concerns around OpenAI\u2019s focus on safety as it tries to build increasingly powerful AI systems. Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher, left the startup in October and announced that OpenAI was dissolving its AGI readiness team, which he had advised. On the same day, the New York Times profiled a former OpenAI researcher, Suchir Balaji, who said he left OpenAI because he thought the startup\u2019s technology would bring more harm than benefit to society.\nOpenAI tells TechCrunch that executives and safety researchers are working on a transition to replace Weng.\n\u201cWe deeply appreciate Lilian\u2019s contributions to breakthrough safety research and building rigorous technical safeguards,\u201d said an OpenAI spokesperson in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are confident the Safety Systems team will continue playing a key role in ensuring our systems are safe and reliable, serving hundreds of millions of people globally.\u201d\nOther executives who have left OpenAI in recent months include CTO Mira Murati, chief research officer Bob McGrew, and research VP Barret Zoph. In August, the prominent researcher Andrej Karpathy and co-founder John Schulman also announced they\u2019d be leaving the startup. Some of these folks, including Leike and Schulman, left to join an OpenAI competitor, Anthropic, while others have gone on to start their own ventures.\"\n\nResponse:",
