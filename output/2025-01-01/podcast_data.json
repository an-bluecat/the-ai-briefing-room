Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Musk posted on X last month that SpaceX holds such sales for employees about every 6 months.\nThese documents offer interesting insights into the investors who are authorized to buy these secondary shares, and the good deals they get.\nIn this offer, investors paid $70 per share to employees, the document shows. That\u2019s an enormous bargain compared to the share prices investors pay when investing in primary rounds \u2014 where the company sells the shares directly to raise capital.\nDuring the primary sale in 2022, shares went for $270. (SpaceX hasn\u2019t sold shares in a primary round at a $70 price since its Series G went for $77.46 per share, the documents say. That was back in 2015, according to PitchBook.)\nOf course, the main reason for the giant discount in price is that employees own common stock and investors who buy into primary rounds typically buy preferred stock that entitles them to dividends and liquidation preferences. They are the first to be paid their investment back if the company ever sells itself.\nIn fact, this doc reveals that as of 2022, if SpaceX sold itself, the first $6.67 billion would be owed to preferred shareholders. Since then, the company has raised another $750 million, so that sum first paid to investors should likely be increased by at least that amount. Should SpaceX actually command its astronomical current valuation of $350 billion, these liquidation preferences \u2014 paying out investors first \u2014 won\u2019t be a problem for employees or other common stock shareholders. But if one day the company goes for an under-$7 billion fire sale, common stockholders could get nothing.\nIn terms of the dividends, as late as 2019, internal documents seen by TechCrunch said that SpaceX never paid any. But if its board of directors wanted to declare dividends, they would be paid out in fixed amounts based on when investors bought shares. Those amounts range from a few pennies per share for shares bought in its earliest and cheapest rounds, to over $10 a share for those bought in later and most expensive rounds.\nFor employees, the news about their shares in 2022 was especially good. In February 2022, SpaceX did a 10-for-1 stock split of its Class A, B and C common shares. The preferred shares were not split. The documents don\u2019t make clear what the differences are between the different classes of common shares. In public companies, different classes often have different voting rights. For example, one class of shares retained by the founder might have 10 votes per share, allowing founders to retain control of their companies while selling shares and cashing out.\nIn this case, it\u2019s not clear when, if ever, SpaceX will go public. Secondary sales like this remain one of the only ways that employees have to sell their shares.\nAnother bit of good news for employees in this sale was that the $70 per share price was an improvement over the previous tender of $56 when adjusting for the stock split, Bloomberg reported at the time. And Bloomberg also reported last month that the next tender offer may be as high as $108 to $110 apiece.\nWhich investors got to buy?\nOne of the most interesting revelations in these documents was that only a handful of investors were named as authorized buyers. And most of them were among the SpaceX orbit, so to speak, meaning the investors are either vocal supporters of SpaceX founder Elon Musk or have had other, historically close ties.\nThey were:\nAndreessen Horowitz (a16z) was authorized to buy nearly 4.3 million shares for almost $300 million. Interestingly, a16z isn\u2019t a historical longtime major investor in SpaceX but managed to get on its cap table in a big way in the company\u2019s $250 million raise in August, 2022, according to PitchBook. It also became a lead investor of SpaceX\u2019s $750 million round, at a $137 billion valuation in 2023, CNBC reported.\nThe firm\u2019s co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has known Musk for the decades that they\u2019ve run in the same Silicon Valley tech billionaire circles. In the past few years, he has become a Musk champion, expressing admiration for the SpaceX, Tesla, and X CEO in all sorts of ways, from how Musk uses his money to keep launching startups to applauding Musk\u2019s perseverance. Andreessen even publicly debated billionaire and rival VC Vinod Khosla (backer of OpenAI) on X (owned by Musk) after Khosla praised OpenAI shortly after Musk sued OpenAI. The debate caught Musk\u2019s attention.\nAliya Capital Partners is associated with Aliya Growth Fund, which was authorized to buy just over 1.4 million shares for nearly $100 million. Aliya is a family office for the wealthy in Miami that says SpaceX is one of its largest holdings. Aliya \u2014 which has stakes in many prized startups like Figure AI, Impossible Foods, Anduril \u2014 notably chipped in $360 million when Musk bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, Reuters reported. Even after Musk took an immediate ax to Twitter headcount, and his management style caused others (and advertisers) to flee, Aliya remained publicly optimistic. \u201cWe believe Twitter will produce a return of 4-5x in just a few years, with comparably limited downside risk,\u201d Aliya chief executive Ross Kestin told Reuters in December 2022.\nAliya also happily champions SpaceX. In April, around the time that Bloomberg reported that its Starlink satellite business is still burning more cash than it brings in, Aliya took to LinkedIn to double down on Musk\u2019s vision. It posted: \u201cRecent reports indicate a staggering 500,000 new Starlink subscribers in the last four months \u2014 a feat far from coincidental \u2014 and over 2.7 million in total. It stands as a testament to profound vision matched by impeccable execution.\u201d\nGigafund, whose co-founder is a SpaceX board member, was allocated over 1.4 million shares at a cost of nearly $100 million. Gigafund was co-founded by fellow PayPal mafia member Luke Nosek who joined Peter Thiel when he founded Founders Fund. Thiel and Musk are, of course, fellow PayPal mafia members. At Founders Fund, Nosek led the first VC investment into Space X, took a board seat, and has been on the board ever since. He left Founders Fund in 2017 to launch Gigafund. Gigafund\u2019s co-founder, Stephen Oskoui, is also a former Founders Fund investor and has led the firm into deals with other Musk companies, including Neuralink and the Boring Company.\n137 Ventures is associated with 137 Holdings, which was authorized to buy just under 1.1 million shares at a cost of nearly $75 million. 137 Ventures is a VC fund that\u2019s interesting because its claim to fame is these kinds of secondary purchases. Founders Justin Fishner-Wolfson and Alex Jacobson met while at Founders Fund, working on its SpaceX investment. When Musk originally lobbied Thiel and Founders Fund to back his new rocket company at the time, the original investment in SpaceX was going to be around $5 million until Fishner-Wolfson advocated that it be much bigger. Founders Fund wound up writing a check that was about 20% of its fund and has continued to take large positions in other SpaceX rounds from other funds, Fishner-Wolfson told TechCrunch\u2019s Connie Loizos in 2020. He launched 137 Ventures in 2011.\nPoint 2 Prove Investment was allocated 1 million shares, which cost $70 million. Point 2 Prove looks like a special purpose vehicle led by the secretive global investment firm Vy Capital, according to SEC Form D from July 2022. Vy was founded by Alexander Tamas, who spent his formative years at Yuri Milner\u2019s DST. While Tamas doesn\u2019t say much in public, and therefore isn\u2019t a vocal Musk supporter, his company committed $700 million to Musk\u2019s Twitter purchase, Bloomberg reported at the time. Vy also has a SpaceX stake and has invested in a number of other Musk companies like Boring and Neuralink. A prospectus for a Vy fund asserts that Tamas was the investor who secured for DST its early stakes in companies like Facebook, Airbnb, Spotify, Twitter, Alibaba and others. Marc Andreessen and his VC firm co-founder Ben Horowitz once described Tamas to Bloomberg as: \u201cHe\u2019s on speed-dial for everyone trying to build the most successful, highest-scale, global Internet companies today.\u201d\nAtreides Management is associated with Atreides Special Circumstances Fund, which was allocated nearly 429,000 shares at a cost of nearly $30 million. The founder of Boston-based hedge fund Atreides, Gavin Baker, goes way back with SpaceX. Before founding Atreides in January 2019, Gavin spent 18 years at Fidelity, rising to manage the $17 billion Fidelity OTC Fund, his website says. He made his first investment in SpaceX while at Fidelity, and in 2022 SpaceX was Atreides\u2019 largest position among the VC portion of its fund, Bloomberg reported. (Atreides had $3 billion in assets under management that year but currently has about $4 billion AUM, according to a recent SEC filing.) The fund has also had a significant stake in Tesla since 2019. And Baker is a public supporter of Musk. Just this month he penned a long post on X advocating to reinstate Musk\u2019s $56 billion Tesla pay package and backing Musk\u2019s desire to move Tesla\u2019s incorporation to Texas.\nTCP Exploration Fund 2022 was allocated over 357,000 shares for nearly $25 million. This is a fund associated with LA\u2019s Troy Capital Partners founded by Myspace founder Josh Berman, according to SEC Form D. However, by several accounts, Troy\u2019s managing partner, Anthony Tucker, is the one responsible for Troy\u2019s SpaceX investment. Troy has been a backer since SpaceX\u2019s Series J round in 2019, which valued the company at about $28 billion post-money, according to PitchBook. Troy, which emphasizes LA-based companies (although doesn\u2019t restrict itself to them), was also an investor in the now-defunct Hyperloop One that had hoped to build speedy underground transport between San Francisco and LA based on Musk\u2019s idea.\nIn addition, this SpaceX sale also authorized two more investors to buy about another $50 million shares combined as well, although the paperwork trail was too thin on both of them for us to determine their associations to Musk.\nSpaceX and all of the funds did not respond to multiple requests for comment except for Atreides, which declined comment.\nUpdate: This story originally published June 19, 2024, and was updated January 1, 2025, to include SpaceX\u2019s latest valuation.\n\ntitle1:\nRobinhood, already a \u2018comeback\u2019 stock, has even more aggressive plans for 2025\ndescription1:\nRobinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has a lot to celebrate this holiday season. After a bumpy few years following Robinhood\u2019s 2021 IPO \u2014 a period during which shares of the commission-free trading app plummeted by more than 90% after it abruptly restricted trading in some meme stocks \u2014 the 12-year-old company was just declared Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201ccomeback stock\u201d of the year.\nAsked about that accolade in recent days over Zoom, Tenev was beaming. \u201cWhen we were a young company and just got started, everyone was kind of rooting for us,\u201d said Tenev, who oversees roughly 2,500 employees at Robinhood. \u201cThen at one point we started being treated as an incumbent \u2026 the vibe became negative, [and] during COVID, it just became strange. [We] were growing like crazy, but people were unhappy, and we hit our low, and now it has been very positive.\u201d\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s around the corner that has Tenev truly excited, however. Like a lot of fintech entrepreneurs, he\u2019s feeling very enthusiastic about a second Trump administration, given that deregulation appears to be a priority, along with a far warmer embrace of cryptocurrency.\nUnsurprisingly, he plans to take advantage of the fast-changing landscape. Indeed, during our chat, we talked about \u201cexploding\u201d job offers and about crypto. We discussed copytrading, a trading strategy that allows clients to automatically replicate the trades of another trader. We also talked about prediction markets, where Robinhood plans to increasingly compete with still-private startups like Kalshi and Polymarket that are squarely focused on allowing people to bet on the outcome of future events.\nYou can listen to the whole thing here; meanwhile, below, you can find excerpts specifically pertaining to prediction markets that have been edited lightly for length.\nI\u2019m seeing that one in 10 Americans [with brokerage accounts] have a Robinhood account, yet you only have a quarter percent of the total retail assets in the United States. Can that be right?\nI haven\u2019t heard that stat. I mean, it doesn\u2019t sound crazy to me. There\u2019s trillions [of dollars] of assets [in the world]. Robinhood\u2019s [AUM] is right around $200 billion, so we\u2019ve still got a long ways to go. We\u2019re bigger than when we started, but some of these guys, like the Schwabs and the Fidelitys, have $10 trillion in assets. So we\u2019re still growing, but our assets are growing 40% plus year over year, rather than 2% to 3%.\nWhen we last sat down in person, this was a much smaller company with ambitions to become a financial services giant; you\u2019ve since gotten into wealth management and credit cards. I\u2019m wondering about some newer financial mechanisms, like prediction markets; how big an opportunity is there, do you think?\nI\u2019ve been a big fan of prediction markets for a long time, and it became clear to me relatively early on that political contracts are the ideal product in that space, because [politics] is very newsworthy and highly correlated to market performance, so useful as a hedge.\nThe one other thing was: Everyone watches the polls and early results on election night to figure out what\u2019s going on, and if you\u2019re watching the news, the picture they paint is very unclear, right? They\u2019re doing all this math for you and tabulating [votes], but they\u2019re not really telling you what the odds are of one candidate or the other winning the election. You contrast that with the prediction markets \u2026 and I think what\u2019s even more powerful is just distilling where things stand right now based on all the information that\u2019s out there. And that\u2019s a very useful use case, not necessarily for prediction itself, but really for the news.\nWe didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be possible to launch [our own presidential election market] for this election because there was the lawsuit with the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC], then Kalshi prevailed in the 11th hour [to offer contracts that pay off as bets on U.S. political elections], and the team mobilized. We put a lot of great people on it, and we went from intending to launch to actually shipping in about two and a half weeks\u2026\nDid you ever talk to Kalshi about potentially buying it?\nI\u2019ve talked to Kalshi, not about buying it. We ended up working with ForecastEx [a CFTC-registered designated contract market (DCM) for forecast contracts]. And, this is a little bit technical, but we\u2019re an FCM, a futures commission merchant, which is kind of like the customer-facing part of a futures or swaps dealer, and so we need to rely on an exchange functionally to serve as the back end of all these trades. And we ended up using ForecastEx because they had all the licensure to be able to do that. My understanding is that Kalshi is only able to offer it to retail directly, not able to serve other FCMs.\nI read that you\u2019ve indicated a move into sports could take the form of event contracts, too.\nI think that was taken a little bit out of context. Certainly, our focus is on federally regulated event contracts rather than traditional sports betting. Right now, event contracts do not permit sports outcomes [but] that might change.\nYou know, there\u2019s going to be a new CFTC Commissioner [and] a lot of people are interested in sports entering the federally regulated realm. I think those products would look very different from traditional sports betting. But yeah, our focus is on event contracts. I think that\u2019s going to be a big thing. The presidential election market proved to us that there\u2019s a lot of demand for these types of products. We had over half a billion contracts traded in about a week [by more than] half a million people. And so I think that the number one thing we were hearing afterward was: Can we have more contracts? Can this be a more-fleshed-out product and not just for the election?\nObviously sports would be huge and perennial. What other types of contracts are you imagining?\nThere\u2019s a lot of possibilities. A natural fit for Robinhood is economic ones. You can see some examples of a Fed hike, a Fed drop \u2026 anything that\u2019s at the intersection of news and financial markets is interesting to us. In my opinion, news has increasingly started to merge with entertainment.\nThere are two ways to look at [event contracts]. One is as an active trader asset, that active traders like to trade alongside options and futures and other things. But the other is as a passive experience, where, if you just want the news, event contracts can be a way to deliver that to you in real time. We\u2019re also thinking about this, and I think that opens up a broader set of possibilities. You can have event contracts on pretty much anything from the Oscars and entertainment events to sports to politics. And the categories of event contracts almost become like the sections of a newspaper, right? Art, style, leisure, sports, business, [the] front page, which is real time. So you can imagine the digital equivalent of a newspaper being delivered via event contracts.\nAgain, for much more with Tenev, you can tune in here.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI failed to deliver the opt-out tool it promised by 2025\ndescription2:\nBack in May, OpenAI said it was developing a tool to let creators specify how they want their works to be included in \u2014 or excluded from \u2014 its AI training data. But 7 months later, this feature has yet to see the light of day.\nCalled Media Manager, the tool would \u201cidentify copyrighted text, images, audio, and video,\u201d OpenAI said at the time, to reflect creators\u2019 preferences \u201cacross multiple sources.\u201d It was intended to stave off some of the company\u2019s fiercest critics, and potentially shield OpenAI from IP-related legal challenges.\nBut people familiar tell TechCrunch that the tool was rarely viewed as an important launch internally. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was a priority,\u201d one former OpenAI employee said. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t remember anyone working on it.\u201d\nA non-employee who coordinates work with the company told TechCrunch in December that they had discussed the tool with OpenAI in the past, but that there haven\u2019t been any recent updates. (These people declined to be publicly identified discussing confidential business matters.)\nAnd a member of OpenAI\u2019s legal team who was working on Media Manager, Fred von Lohmann, transitioned to a part-time consultant role in October. OpenAI PR confirmed Von Lohmann\u2019s move to TechCrunch via email.\nOpenAI has yet to give an update on Media Manager\u2019s progress, and the company missed a self-imposed deadline to have the tool in place \u201cby 2025.\u201d (To be clear, \u201cby 2025\u201d could be read as inclusive of the year 2025, but TechCrunch interpreted OpenAI\u2019s language to mean leading up to January 1, 2025.)\nIP issues\nAI models like OpenAI\u2019s learn patterns in sets of data to make predictions \u2014 for instance, that a person biting into a burger will leave a bite mark. This allows models to learn how the world works, to a degree, by observing it. ChatGPT can write convincing emails and essays, while Sora, OpenAI\u2019s video generator, can create relatively realistic footage.\nThe ability to draw on examples of writing, film, and more to generate new works makes AI incredibly powerful. But it\u2019s also regurgitative. When prompted in a certain way, models \u2014 most of which are trained on countless web pages, videos, and images \u2014 produce near-copies of that data, which despite being \u201cpublicly available,\u201d are not meant to be used this way.\nFor example, Sora can generate clips featuring TikTok\u2019s logo and popular video game characters. The New York Times has gotten ChatGPT to quote its articles verbatim (OpenAI blamed the behavior on a \u201chack\u201c).\nThis has understandably upset creators whose works have been swept up in AI training without their permission. Many have lawyered up.\nOpenAI is fighting class action lawsuits filed by artists, writers, YouTubers, computer scientists, and news organizations, all of whom claim the startup trained on their works illegally. Plaintiffs include authors Sarah Silverman and Ta Nehisi-Coates, visual artists, and media conglomerates like The New York Times and Radio-Canada, to name a few.\nOpenAI has pursued licensing deals with select partners, but not all creators see the terms as attractive.\nManaging media\nOpenAI offers creators several ad hoc ways to \u201copt out\u201d of its AI training. Last September, the company launched a submission form to allow artists to flag their work for removal from its future training sets. And OpenAI has long let webmasters block its web-crawling bots from scraping data across their domains.\nBut creators have criticized these methods as haphazard and inadequate. There aren\u2019t specific opt-out mechanisms for written works, videos, or audio recordings. And the opt-out form for images requires submitting a copy of each image to be removed along with a description, an onerous process.\nMedia Manager was pitched as a complete revamp \u2014 and expansion \u2014 of OpenAI\u2019s opt-out solutions today.\nIn the announcement post in May, OpenAI said that Media Manager would use \u201ccutting-edge machine learning research\u201d to enable creators and content owners to \u201ctell [OpenAI] what they own.\u201d OpenAI, which claimed it was collaborating with regulators as it developed the tool, said that it hoped Media Manager would \u201cset a standard across the AI industry.\u201d\nOpenAI has never publicly mentioned Media Manager since.\nA spokesperson told TechCrunch that the tool was \u201cstill in development\u201d as of August, but didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up request for comment in mid-December.\nOpenAI has given no indication as to when Media Manager might launch \u2014 or even which features and capabilities it might launch with.\nFair use\nAssuming Media Manager does arrive at some point, experts aren\u2019t convinced that it will allay creators\u2019 concerns \u2014 or do much to resolve the legal questions surrounding AI and IP usage.\nAdrian Cyhan, an IP attorney at Stubbs Alderton & Markiles, noted that Media Manager as described is an ambitious undertaking. Even platforms as large as YouTube and TikTok struggle with content ID at scale. Could OpenAI really do better?\n\u201cEnsuring compliance with legally-required creator protections and potential compensation requirements under consideration presents challenges,\u201d Cyhan told TechCrunch, \u201cespecially given the rapidly-evolving and potentially divergent legal landscape across national and local jurisdictions.\u201d\nEd Newton-Rex, the founder of Fairly Trained, a nonprofit that certifies AI companies are respecting creators\u2019 rights, believes that Media Manager would unfairly shift the burden of controlling AI training onto creators; by not using it, they arguably could be giving tacit approval for their works to be used. \u201cMost creators will never even hear about it, let alone use it,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cBut it will nevertheless be used to defend the mass exploitation of creative work against creators\u2019 wishes.\u201d\nMike Borella, co-chair of MBHB\u2019s AI practice group, pointed out that opt-out systems don\u2019t always account for transformations that might be made to a work, like an image that\u2019s been downsampled. They also might not address the all-to-common scenario of third-party platforms hosting copies of creators\u2019 content, added Joshua Weigensberg, an IP and media lawyer for Pryor Cashman.\n\u201cCreators and copyright owners do not control, and often do not even know, where their works appear on the internet,\u201d Weigensberg said. \u201cEven if a creator tells every single AI platform that they are opting out of training, those companies may well still go ahead and train on copies of their works available on third-party websites and services.\u201d\nMedia Manager might not even be especially advantageous for OpenAI, at least from a jurisprudential standpoint. Evan Everist, a partner at Dorsey & Whitney specializing in copyright law, said that while OpenAI could use the tool to show a judge it\u2019s mitigating its training on IP-protected content, Media Manager likely wouldn\u2019t shield the company from damages if it was found to have infringed.\n\u201cCopyright owners do not have an obligation to go out and preemptively tell others not to infringe their works before that infringement occurs,\u201d Everist said. \u201cThe basics of copyright law still apply \u2014 i.e., don\u2019t take and copy other people\u2019s stuff without permission. This feature may be more about PR and positioning OpenAI as an ethical user of content.\u201d\nA reckoning\nIn the absence of Media Manager, OpenAI has implemented filters \u2014 albeit imperfect ones \u2014 to prevent its models from regurgitating training examples. And in the lawsuits it\u2019s battling, the company continues to claim fair use protections, asserting that its models create transformative, not plagiaristic, works.\nOpenAI could well prevail in its copyright disputes.\nThe courts may decide that the company\u2019s AI has a \u2018transformative purpose,\u201d following the precedent set roughly a decade ago in the publishing industry\u2019s suit against Google. In that case, a court held that Google\u2019s copying of millions of books for Google Books, a sort of digital archive, was permissible.\nOpenAI has said publicly that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to train competitive AI models without using copyrighted materials \u2014 authorized or no. \u201cLimiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today\u2019s citizens,\u201d the company wrote in a January submission to the U.K.\u2019s House of Lords.\nShould courts eventually declare OpenAI victorious, Media Manager wouldn\u2019t serve much of a legal purpose. OpenAI seems to be willing to make that bet \u2014 or to reconsider its opt-out strategy.\n\ntitle3:\nSilicon Valley stifled the AI doom movement in 2024\ndescription3:\nFor several years now, technologists have rung alarm bells about the potential for advanced AI systems to cause catastrophic damage to the human race.\nBut in 2024, those warning calls were drowned out by a practical and prosperous vision of generative AI promoted by the tech industry \u2013 a vision that also benefited their wallets.\nThose warning of catastrophic AI risk are often called \u201cAI doomers,\u201d though it\u2019s not a name they\u2019re fond of. They\u2019re worried that AI systems will make decisions to kill people, be used by the powerful to oppress the masses, or contribute to the downfall of society in one way or another.\nIn 2023, it seemed like we were in the beginning of a renaissance era for technology regulation. AI doom and AI safety \u2014 a broader subject that can encompass hallucinations, insufficient content moderation, and other ways AI can harm society \u2014 went from a niche topic discussed in San Francisco coffee shops to a conversation appearing on MSNBC, CNN, and the front pages of the New York Times.\nTo sum up the warnings issued in 2023: Elon Musk and more than 1,000 technologists and scientists called for a pause on AI development, asking the world to prepare for the technology\u2019s profound risks. Shortly after, top scientists at OpenAI, Google, and other labs signed an open letter saying the risk of AI causing human extinction should be given more credence. Months later, President Biden signed an AI executive order with a general goal to protect Americans from AI systems. In November 2023, the non-profit board behind the world\u2019s leading AI developer, OpenAI, fired Sam Altman, claiming its CEO had a reputation for lying and couldn\u2019t be trusted with a technology as important as artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 once the imagined endpoint of AI, meaning systems that actually show self-awareness. (Although the definition is now shifting to meet the business needs of those talking about it.)\nFor a moment, it seemed as if the dreams of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs would take a backseat to the overall health of society.\nBut to those entrepreneurs, the narrative around AI doom was more concerning than the AI models themselves.\nIn response, a16z cofounder Marc Andreessen published \u201cWhy AI will save the world\u201d in June 2023, a 7,000 word essay dismantling the AI doomers\u2019 agenda and presenting a more optimistic vision of how the technology will play out.\nSAN FRANCISCO, CA \u2013 SEPTEMBER 13: Entrepreneur Marc Andreessen speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 at Pier 48 on September 13, 2016 in San Francisco, California. (Photo by Steve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch) Image Credits:Steve Jennings / Getty Images\n\u201cThe era of Artificial Intelligence is here, and boy are people freaking out. Fortunately, I am here to bring the good news: AI will not destroy the world, and in fact may save it,\u201d said Andreessen in the essay.\nIn his conclusion, Andreessen gave a convenient solution to our AI fears: move fast and break things \u2013 basically the same ideology that has defined every other 21st century technology (and their attendant problems). He argued that Big Tech companies and startups should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as possible, with few to no regulatory barriers. This would ensure AI does not fall into the hands of a few powerful companies or governments, and would allow America to compete effectively with China, he said.\nOf course, this would also allow a16z\u2019s many AI startups to make a lot more money \u2014 and some found his techno-optimism uncouth in an era of extreme income disparity, pandemics, and housing crises.\nWhile Andreessen doesn\u2019t always agree with Big Tech, making money is one area the entire industry can agree on. a16z\u2019s co-founders wrote a letter with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella this year, essentially asking the government not to regulate the AI industry at all.\nMeanwhile, despite their frantic hand-waving in 2023, Musk and other technologists did not slow down to focus on safety in 2024 \u2013 quite the opposite: AI investment in 2024 outpaced anything we\u2019ve seen before. Altman quickly returned to the helm of OpenAI, and a mass of safety researchers left the outfit in 2024 while ringing alarm bells about its dwindling safety culture.\nBiden\u2019s safety-focused AI executive order has largely fallen out of favor this year in Washington, D.C. \u2013 the incoming President-elect, Donald Trump, announced plans to repeal Biden\u2019s order, arguing it hinders AI innovation. Andreessen says he\u2019s been advising Trump on AI and technology in recent months, and a longtime venture capitalist at a16z, Sriram Krishnan, is now Trump\u2019s official senior adviser on AI.\nRepublicans in Washington have several AI-related priorities that outrank AI doom today, according to Dean Ball, an AI-focused research fellow at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center. Those include building out data centers to power AI, using AI in the government and military, competing with China, limiting content moderation from center-left tech companies, and protecting children from AI chatbots.\n\u201cI think [the movement to prevent catastrophic AI risk] has lost ground at the federal level. At the state and local level they have also lost the one major fight they had,\u201d said Ball in an interview with TechCrunch. Of course, he\u2019s referring to California\u2019s controversial AI safety bill SB 1047.\nPart of the reason AI doom fell out of favor in 2024 was simply because, as AI models became more popular, we also saw how unintelligent they can be. It\u2019s hard to imagine Google Gemini becoming Skynet when it just told you to put glue on your pizza.\nBut at the same time, 2024 was a year when many AI products seemed to bring concepts from science fiction to life. For the first time this year: OpenAI showed how we could talk with our phones and not through them, and Meta unveiled smart glasses with real-time visual understanding. The ideas underlying catastrophic AI risk largely stem from sci-fi films, and while there\u2019s obviously a limit, the AI era is proving that some ideas from sci-fi may not be fictional forever.\n2024\u2019s biggest AI doom fight: SB 1047\nState Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat from California, right, during the Bloomberg BNEF Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2024. The summit provides the ideas, insights and connections to formulate successful strategies, capitalize on technological change and shape a cleaner, more competitive future.

The bill tried to prevent advanced AI systems from causing mass human extinction events and cyberattacks that could cause more damage than 2024\u2019s CrowdStrike outage.\nSB 1047 passed through California\u2019s Legislature, making it all the way to Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk, where he called it a bill with \u201coutsized impact.\u201d The bill tried to prevent the kinds of things Musk, Altman, and many other Silicon Valley leaders warned about in 2023 when they signed those open letters on AI.\nBut Newsom vetoed SB 1047. In the days before his decision, he talked about AI regulation on stage in downtown San Francisco, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t solve for everything. What can we solve for?\u201d\nThat pretty clearly sums up how many policymakers are thinking about catastrophic AI risk today. It\u2019s just not a problem with a practical solution.\nEven so, SB 1047 was flawed beyond its focus on catastrophic AI risk. The bill regulated AI models based on size, in an attempt to only regulate the largest players. However, that didn\u2019t account for new techniques such as test-time compute or the rise of small AI models, which leading AI labs are already pivoting to. Furthermore, the bill was widely considered an assault on open-source AI \u2013 and by proxy, the research world \u2013 because it would have limited firms like Meta and Mistral from releasing highly customizable frontier AI models.\nBut according to the bill\u2019s author, state Senator Scott Wiener, Silicon Valley played dirty to sway public opinion about SB 1047. He previously told TechCrunch that venture capitalists from Y Combinator and A16Z engaged in a propaganda campaign against the bill.\nSpecifically, these groups spread a claim that SB 1047 would send software developers to jail for perjury. Y Combinator asked young founders to sign a letter saying as much in June 2024. Around the same time, Andreessen Horowitz general partner Anjney Midha made a similar claim on a podcast.\nThe Brookings Institution labeled this as one of many misrepresentations of the bill. SB 1047 did mention how tech executives would need to submit reports identifying shortcomings of their AI models, and the bill noted that lying on a government document is perjury. However, the venture capitalists who spread these fears failed to mention that people are rarely charged for perjury, and even more rarely convicted.\nYC rejected the idea that they spread misinformation, previously telling TechCrunch that SB 1047 was vague and not as concrete as Senator Wiener made it out to be.\nMore generally, there was a growing sentiment during the SB 1047 fight that AI doomers were not just anti-technology, but also delusional. Famed investor Vinod Khosla called Wiener clueless about the real dangers of AI at TechCrunch\u2019s 2024 Disrupt event.\nMeta\u2019s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, has long opposed the ideas underlying AI doom, but became more outspoken this year.\n\u201cThe idea that somehow [intelligent] systems will come up with their own goals and take over humanity is just preposterous, it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said LeCun at Davos in 2024, noting how we\u2019re very far from developing superintelligent AI systems. \u201cThere are lots and lots of ways to build [any technology] in ways that will be dangerous, wrong, kill people, etc\u2026 But as long as there is one way to do it right, that\u2019s all we need.\u201d\nThe fight ahead in 2025\nThe policymakers behind SB 1047 have hinted they may come back in 2025 with a modified bill to address long-term AI risks. One of the sponsors behind the bill, Encode, says the national attention SB 1047 drew was a positive signal.\n\u201cThe AI safety movement made very encouraging progress in 2024, despite the veto of SB 1047,\u201d said Sunny Gandhi, Encode\u2019s Vice President of Political Affairs, in an email to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are optimistic that the public\u2019s awareness of long-term AI risks is growing and there is increasing willingness among policymakers to tackle these complex challenges.\u201d\nGandhi says Encode expects \u201csignificant efforts\u201d in 2025 to regulate around AI-assisted catastrophic risk, though he did not disclose any specific one.\nOn the opposite side, a16z general partner Martin Casado is one of the people leading the fight against regulating catastrophic AI risk. In a December op-ed on AI policy, Casado argued that we need more reasonable AI policy moving forward, declaring that \u201cAI appears to be tremendously safe.\u201d\n\u201cThe first wave of dumb AI policy efforts is largely behind us,\u201d said Casado in a December tweet. \u201cHopefully we can be smarter going forward.\u201d\nCalling AI \u201ctremendously safe\u201d and attempts to regulate it \u201cdumb\u201d is something of an oversimplification. For example, Character.AI \u2013 a startup a16z has invested in \u2013 is currently being sued and investigated over child safety concerns. In one active lawsuit, a 14-year-old Florida boy killed himself after allegedly confiding his suicidal thoughts to a Character.AI chatbot that he had romantic and sexual chats with. This case shows how our society has to prepare for new types of risks around AI that may have sounded ridiculous just a few years ago.\nThere are more bills floating around that address long-term AI risk \u2013 including one just introduced at the federal level by Senator Mitt Romney. But now, it seems AI doomers will be fighting an uphill battle in 2025.\n\ntitle4:\nCybertruck explosion outside Trump hotel in Vegas leaves 1 dead, 7 injured\ndescription4:\nA Tesla Cybertruck that exploded and burst into flames Wednesday morning just outside the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas has left one person dead and several injured, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.\nSeven people suffered minor injuries, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said during a media briefing Wednesday.\nMcMahill did not identify the individual who was killed. However, in a second briefing held late afternoon Wednesday, McMahill provided new information, including that the Cybertruck was rented in Colorado via peer-to-peer rental company Turo and driven to Las Vegas, arriving around 7:30 a.m. PT. The individual drove the Cybertruck through the Las Vegas Strip until it reached the hotel where the incident occurred, he said.\nPolice know the identity of the person who rented the vehicle and McMahill said they are looking at that individual. \u201cI am not prepared to release the name of any of the individuals that we are looking at least until next of kin is notified and we have a 100% identification,\u201d he added.\nDetectives found gasoline canisters and large firework mortars in the bed of the truck. McMahill said the structure of the Cybertruck \u201climited the damage\u201d that occurred inside of the valet area near the hotel entrance.\nScreenshot: Las VEgas Police Department Images shared during press conference\nAn eyewitness who captured video of the fire from inside the hotel lobby and posted it on X, said the vehicle pulled up outside and then \u201cblew up.\u201d The video, and others like it, quickly spread on X.\nLaw enforcement continues to investigate a number of leads, McMahill said. Gov. Joe Lombardo said his office was coordinating with LVMPD and partner agencies.\nDuring both media briefings, McMahill referenced the fatal attack that occurred Wednesday morning in New Orleans and killed at least 15 people. He didn\u2019t make an implicit connection to the attack, but said law enforcement was taking precautions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very well aware of what has happened in New Orleans with the event that occurred there, and the number of victims there, and the additional IEDs,\u201d he said during the Wednesday afternoon press conference. \u201cSo as you can imagine, with an explosion here on iconic Las Vegas Boulevard, we are taking all of the precautions that we need to take to keep our community safe.\u201d\nMcMahill noted that both vehicles, the Cybertruck and a Ford truck in New Orleans, were rented via Turo. He called it a \u201ccoincidence\u201d and said it was being investigated. Turo, which was founded in 2010 and has been compared to the Airbnb for cars, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup\u2019s website or app. The company, which filed for an IPO in 2022, was expected to go public this year.\nA Turo spokesperson told TechCrunch in an emailed statement the company is working with law enforcement.\n\u201cWe are heartbroken by the violence perpetrated in New Orleans and Las Vegas, and our prayers are with the victims and families. We are actively partnering with law enforcement authorities as they investigate both incidents,\u201d the emailed statement said. \u201cWe do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat. We remain committed to maintaining the highest standards in risk management, thanks to our world-class trust and safety technologies and teams that include experienced former law enforcement professionals.\u201d\nMcMahill said law enforcement was looking for secondary devices, adding there does not appear to be any further threat to the Las Vegas community. \u201cIf that changes, obviously you will hear directly from me to provide any update to you,\u201d he said.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk posted several notes on X, initially stating that the \u201cwhole senior Tesla team is investigating\u201d the incident. \u201cWill post more information as soon as we learn anything. We\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Musk wrote.\nMusk later posted that the vehicle was operating as normal, according to telemetry data he said the Tesla team viewed.\n\u201cWe have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself. All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion,\u201d he wrote.\nMcMahill personally thanked Musk for providing law enforcement with specific information about the operation of the Cybertruck as well as video from Tesla charging stations used by the individual.\nThe incident comes as Musk, who also owns X, maintains a close connection to President-elect Donald Trump. A review of Musk\u2019s flight data showed at least 31 flights to or from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. This week, the NYT reported that Musk has been staying at a cottage on the Mar-a-Lago property.\nThis article has been updated with new information, including the explosion left one person dead and several injured, what contents were found in the vehicle, and images.\"\n\nResponse:",
