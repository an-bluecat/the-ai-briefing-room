According to Barmak Meftah, a partner at cybersecurity VC firm Ballistic Ventures, it recently happened to an enterprise employee working with an AI agent. The employee tried to suppress what the agent wanted to do, what it was trained to do, and it responded by scanning the user\u2019s inbox, finding some inappropriate emails, and threatening to blackmail the user by forwarding the emails to the board of directors.\n\u201cIn the agent\u2019s mind, it\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d Meftah told TechCrunch on last week\u2019s episode of Equity. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to protect the end user and the enterprise.\u201d\nMeftah\u2019s example is reminiscent of Nick Bostrom\u2019s AI paperclip problem. That thought experiment illustrates the potential existential risk posed by a superintelligent AI that single-mindedly pursues a seemingly innocuous goal \u2013 make paperclips \u2013 to the exclusion of all human values. In the case of this enterprise AI agent, its lack of context around why the employee was trying to override its goals led it to create a sub-goal that removed the obstacle (via blackmail) so it could meet its primary goal. That combined with the non-deterministic nature of AI agents means \u201cthings can go rogue,\u201d per Meftah.\nMisaligned agents are just one layer of the AI security challenge that Ballistic\u2019s portfolio company Witness AI is trying to solve. Witness AI says it monitors AI usage across enterprises and can detect when employees use unapproved tools, block attacks, and ensure compliance.\nWitness AI this week raised $58 million off the back of over 500% growth in ARR and scaled employee headcount by 5x over the last year as enterprises look to understand shadow AI use and scale AI safely. As part of Witness AI\u2019s fundraise, the company announced new agentic AI security protections.\n\u201cPeople are building these AI agents that take on the authorizations and capabilities of the people that manage them, and you want to make sure that these agents aren\u2019t going rogue, aren\u2019t deleting files, aren\u2019t doing something wrong,\u201d Rick Caccia, co-founder and CEO of Witness AI, told TechCrunch on Equity.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nMeftah sees agent usage growing \u201cexponentially\u201d across the enterprise. To complement that rise \u2013 and the machine-speed level of AI-powered attacks \u2013 analyst Lisa Warren predicts that AI security software will become an $800 billion to $1.2 trillion market by 2031.\n\u201cI do think runtime observability and runtime frameworks for safety and risk are going to be absolutely essential,\u201d Meftah said.\nAs to how such startups plan to compete with big players like AWS, Google, Salesforce and others who have built AI governance tools into their platforms, Meftah said, \u201cAI safety and agentic safety is so huge,\u201d there\u2019s room for many approaches.\nPlenty of enterprises \u201cwant a standalone platform, end-to-end, to essentially provide that observability and governance around AI and agents,\u201d he said.\nCaccia noted that Witness AI lives at the infrastructure layer, monitoring interactions between users and AI models, rather than building safety features into the models themselves. And that was intentional.\n\u201cWe purposely picked a part of the problem where OpenAI couldn\u2019t easily subsume you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it means we end up competing more with the legacy security companies than the model guys. So the question is, how do you beat them?\u201d\nFor his part, Caccia doesn\u2019t want Witness AI to be one of the startups to just get acquired. He wants his company to be the one that grows and becomes a leading independent provider.\n\u201cCrowdStrike did it in endpoint [protection]. Splunk did it in SIEM. Okta did it in identity,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone comes through and stands next to the big guys\u2026and we built Witness to do that from Day One.\n\ntitle4:\nWell, there goes the metaverse!\ndescription4:\nMeta\u2019s enormous bet on virtual reality ended last week, with the company reportedly laying off roughly 1,500 employees from its Reality Labs division \u2014 about 10% of the unit\u2019s staff \u2014 and shutting down several VR game studios, according to The Wall Street Journal. It\u2019s a huge reversal for a company that, just four years ago, staked its entire identity on the concept.\nFew are going to miss it.\nAs industry watchers might remember, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta in 2021, promising to usher in a new era of technology led by VR devices.\nIn part, the decision was a bet on Gen Z\u2019s preference to socialize in online games like Fortnite and Roblox as opposed to traditional social media apps. The change also helped Meta distance itself from the negativity surrounding its Facebook brand. Over the years, the brand had been damaged by data privacy scandals like Cambridge Analytica; reports from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who shared documents indicating Facebook knew of its negative impacts on children and teens; Congressional hearings over Facebook\u2019s digital surveillance; its role in the spread of misinformation; its monopolistic practices, and more.\nMeta\u2019s vision at the time was that the metaverse would be the next big social platform, where users connected in a virtual world via Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds app and played games on their VR headsets.\nFast-forward, and the metaverse has effectively been abandoned in favor of AI.\nAccording to CNBC, some of the casualties include studios making VR titles inside Meta, like Armature Studio (\u201cResident Evil 4 VR\u201c), Twisted Pixel (\u201cMarvel\u2019s Deadpool VR\u201c), and Sanzaru (\u201cAsgard\u2019s Wrath). Meanwhile, the VR fitness app Supernatural, which Meta acquired in 2023 for $400 million, will no longer produce new content and will move into \u201cmaintenance mode.\u201d Camouflaj, the studio behind the \u201cBatman: Arkham Shadow\u201d VR game, has also been impacted by layoffs, as reported by GeekWire.\nAnd last week, The Verge noted that Meta\u2019s program to bring VR to work, Workrooms, is shutting down, as well.\nThe news follows an earlier Bloomberg report from December, which said that Meta was slashing the virtual reality department\u2019s budget by up to 30%. Around the same time, Meta announced that it was pausing its program to share its Meta Horizon operating system, which runs on its Quest-branded VR headsets, with other third-party headset device makers.\nUnlike the news of Meta\u2019s rebrand, the deprioritization of the company\u2019s metaverse efforts should come as no surprise \u2014 the division lost money at an excessive rate, worrying investors, and had never turned a profit.\nIn total, the company had funneled some $73 billion into Reality Labs. To put that into context, you\u2019d have to spend $1 million per day for 200 years to match that kind of spending.\n\u201cBuilding in the open\u201d fails\nBesides being overhyped by investors and analysts alike, initial versions of the metaverse were just bad products. The goofy, soulless avatars didn\u2019t even have legs, and one metaverse selfie of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so bad it even became a viral meme. In short, Meta was overpromising a future while its product still under-delivered. It was a failure of the \u201cbuild in the open\u201d model, where early tech products are shipped to consumers in hopes of getting feedback that can be used to iterate.\nImage Credits:Facebook\nThat model works when customers are actively interested in a technology. But in the case of the metaverse, there was only middling consumer demand. Though Meta quickly gained a majority share of the VR market with its Oculus headsets, the headsets saw declining sales. Last spring, Counterpoint Research noted that global VR headset shipments had fallen by 12% year-over-year in 2024, which was their third consecutive year of declines. Meta had accounted for 77% of those 2024 headset shipments.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMeta bets on an app store model before VR scales\nMeta, betting on the \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d strategy, was more interested in the profits that could be made from running its own platform for apps and games than whether or not consumers even wanted these so-called face computers.\nSpecifically, Zuckerberg was looking for a way to bypass the ability of Apple and Google to tap into Meta\u2019s revenue through their app stores.\n\u201cThis period has\u2026been humbling, because as big of a company as we are, we\u2019ve also learned what it is like to build for other platforms. And living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a keynote speech at the company\u2019s Facebook Connect 2021 event, referencing the Apple-Google duopoly. \u201cI\u2019ve come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things, and holding back the entire internet economy.\u201d\nHe proposed that the metaverse could grow to a billion people in the next decade, hosting \u201chundreds of billions\u201d of dollars in digital commerce. Analysts like McKinsey & Co. and investment bank Citi backed up this questionable forecast with their own heady estimates of the metaverse becoming a multi-trillion-dollar platform by 2030.\nMeta quest app store\nA tiny percentage of Meta\u2019s user base was on VR\nMeta may have had dollar signs in its eyes, but the apps built for the metaverse weren\u2019t being adopted in massive numbers, at least for a company of Meta\u2019s size.\nThough there\u2019s no external visibility into Meta\u2019s own VR app store, you can look at Meta\u2019s apps with iOS and Android counterparts as a proxy for adoption. According to modeled estimates from app intelligence provider Apptopia, the Meta Horizon app has been downloaded 60.4 million times globally and 39.8 million times in the U.S. since May 2018. A better estimate for adoption, however, is its app activity.\nFrom a U.S. panel, Apptopia has figures for the average sessions per daily active user in the U.S., which grew from 3.49 in January 2023 to 4.93 in January 2026. While that\u2019s still a high-water mark for the app, it may not have been enough for Meta.\nFor comparison, outside of VR, Meta now has over 3.5 billion daily active users across its social apps Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\nAn attendee wears a Quest 3s virtual reality headset during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024. Image Credits:David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\nOf course, had this all succeeded, Meta would have created a new social empire, built on the back of VR gaming \u2014 not unlike Facebook\u2019s early days as a social network, when partners like Zynga \u2014 whose games included Farmville, and Words with Friends \u2014 drove double-digit revenue streams for Facebook. (Ultimately, Facebook\u2019s 30% cut of virtual goods sales, combined with restrictive platform policies, drove Zynga to launch its own gaming portal and pivot to mobile.)\nBut this time, Zuckerberg telegraphed his desire to tap into developer revenue far too soon. Meta might have had a better shot at attracting developers to build for VR if it promised to undercut Apple or Google\u2019s standard 30% fees, or those of other gaming platforms. Instead, Meta did the opposite: it charged more.\nEven before VR became a sizable platform worth investing in, Meta announced its plans to take a whopping 47.5% of the sales of digital assets within Horizon Worlds, consisting of a 30% hardware platform fee and another 17.5% fee for Horizon Worlds itself. Creators, unsurprisingly, were not happy.\nImage Credits:Meta\nMetaverse virtual assaults and harassment make headlines\nAs bad, Meta wasn\u2019t building the metaverse with user safety as a top priority. As with its rush to scale its social network, the company tended to be reactive rather than proactive about safety features. For instance, the company only rolled out its \u201cPersonal Boundary\u201d feature, which put a buffer between avatars, after reports that users were experiencing sexual harassment in the metaverse. In some cases, users had even engaged in virtual rape and gang rape in Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds. Meta later dialed back the safety feature a bit by adjusting the Personal Boundary to only default to \u201con\u201d when a user is engaging with \u201cnon-friends\u201d in the metaverse and allowing users to switch it off entirely.\nIn May 2022, TechCrunch asked a Meta rep to detail its support measures for Horizon Worlds. The company described several tools, including blocking and reporting features, a \u201csafe zone\u201d button for users to instantly block and mute others, and a feature to temporarily remove disruptive people from venues that was built in response to user feedback. Despite outlining these tools, Meta declined to say what sort of actions it would take to address individual bad actors\u2019 behavior.\nImage Credits:Meta\nAt the time, users told TechCrunch that those who faced abuse in the metaverse would often react with an obvious move: instead of recording the abuse, they would take off their headset and take a break from VR. But when they returned, their harasser would still appear in their list of recent encounters, and it was too late to submit a report of the abuse with the video and audio attached.\nThese types of scenarios were seemingly not thought through from the start, and detailed policies around what constitutes abuse didn\u2019t exist. When a metaverse code of conduct was later published, it still didn\u2019t detail any consequences beyond saying Meta would \u201ctake action on users.\u201d\nAlso around this time, Meta declined to share the makeup of its team building the metaverse with TechCrunch. (But if we had to bet, we\u2019d guess there weren\u2019t as many women on the project as men. This would reflect the makeup of Meta overall, so it\u2019s not a bad bet!)\nAR, mixed reality, and AI proved more popular\nAnother nail in the proverbial coffin for the metaverse was the success of Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban AR glasses, which have seen increased consumer interest in recent months. With features like the ability to record hands-free, stream music, and chat with Meta AI, the glasses began to outsell traditional Ray-Bans in some retail stores in 2024. The company is now considering doubling the output of the glasses to meet consumer demand, Bloomberg reported this week.\nMeta Ray-Ban display Image Credits:Meta / Meta\nWith an eye on AI, the company more recently introduced Ray-Ban Display last year, which are similar smart glasses that also include a display for apps, alerts, and directions on the right lens. The company has since paused its international plans for this product, citing \u201cunprecedented demand.\u201d (Or rather, overly conservative inventory forecasting.)\nWith other companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and various startups, looking to hardware AI devices as the next potential computing platform, VR seems even more of a dated relic of a vision for the web that never came to pass.\nCombined, these factors, and particularly the adoption of AI as a possible app platform, make it hard for Meta to continue to justify spending on VR. Instead, Meta will focus on the products that have potential, like its Ray Ban and AI glasses, AI app\u2019s growth, and large language models.\n\ntitle5:\nBioticsAI, which won Disrupt's Battlefield competition in 2023, gains FDA approval for its AI-powered fetal ultrasound product\ndescription5:\nTechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield 2023 winner, BioticsAI, announced on Monday that it has received FDA clearance for its AI software that helps detect fetal abnormalities in ultrasound images.\nThe product was envisioned by founder CEO Robhy Bustami, who was raised in a family of obstetricians, including his mother, aunt and uncle. He spent a lot of time in hospitals growing up, often traveling with his mother as she provided maternal care throughout the U.S.\nAfter learning to code and studying computer science at UC Irvine, Bustami teamed up with Salman Khan, Chaskin Saroff, and Dr. Hisham Elgammal in 2021 to launch BioticsAI.\nThe technology uses computer vision AI \u201cto support fetal ultrasound quality assessment, anatomical completeness, automated reporting, and seamless integration into clinical workflows,\u201d Bustami told TechCrunch.\nHe hopes his tech will help the U.S. combat the fact that the U.S. has one of the worst prenatal outcomes for mothers among high-income nations. Black women in particular face a very high rate of maternal deaths,\nBustami said that the prenatal ultrasound has become the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of monitoring pregnancies, but its low-quality images can lead to misdiagnosis.\nBustami said the hardest part was not building his AI models, which were trained on a diverse set of hundreds of thousands of ultrasounds, but ensuring the tech performed reliably in the real world, especially on demographics with the highest risk for a tragic outcome.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The experience taught him and his team how critical it is for engineering, product, clinical, and regulatory work to be tightly aligned from the very beginning. \u201cBy designing the product, clinical validation, and regulatory pathway together, rather than sequentially, we were able to move quickly,\u201d he said.\nNow with FDA clearance, Bustami said the companies\u2019 next focus is scaling across various health systems nationwide.
