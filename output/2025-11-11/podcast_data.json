Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The SoftBank founder\u2019s career has been studded with eyebrow-raising bets, each one seemingly more outrageous than the last.\nHis latest move is to cash out his entire $5.8 billion Nvidia stake to go all-in on AI. And while it surprised the business world on Tuesday, it maybe should not. At this point, it\u2019s almost more surprising when the 68-year-old Son doesn\u2019t push his chips to the center of the table.\nConsider that during the late 1990s dot-com bubble, Son\u2019s net worth soared to about $78 billion by February 2000, briefly making him the richest person in the world. Then came the ugly dot-com implosion months later. He lost $70 billion personally \u2013 which, at the time, was the largest financial loss by any individual in history \u2014 as SoftBank\u2019s market cap plummeted 98% from $180 billion to just $2.5 billion.\nAmid that terribleness, Son made what would become his most legendary bet: a $20 million investment in Alibaba in 2000, one decided (the story goes) after just a six-minute meeting with Jack Ma. That stake would eventually grow to be worth $150 billion by 2020, transforming him into one of the venture industry\u2019s most celebrated figures and funding his comeback.\nThat Alibaba success has often made it harder to see when Son has stayed too long at the table. When Son needed capital to launch his first Vision Fund in 2017, he didn\u2019t hesitate to seek $45 billion from Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2013 long before taking Saudi money became acceptable in Silicon Valley.\nAfter journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in October 2018, Son condemned the killing as \u201chorrific and deeply regrettable\u201d but insisted SoftBank couldn\u2019t \u201cturn our backs on the Saudi people,\u201d maintaining the firm\u2019s commitment to managing the kingdom\u2019s capital. In fact, the Vision Fund actually ramped up dealmaking soon after.\nThat didn\u2019t turn out so well.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nA big bet on Uber generated paper losses for years. Then came WeWork. Son overrode his lieutenants\u2019 objections, fell \u201cin love\u201d with founder Adam Neumann, and assigned the co-working company a dizzying valuation of $47 billion in early 2019 after making several previous investments in the company. But WeWork\u2019s IPO plans collapsed after it published a famously troubling S-1 filing. The company never quite recovered \u2013 even after pushing out Neumann and instituting a series of belt-tightening measures \u2013 ultimately costing SoftBank $11.5 billion in equity losses and another $2.2 billion in debt. (Son reportedly later called it \u201ca stain on my life.\u201d)\nSon has been mounting another comeback for years, and Tuesday will undoubtedly be remembered as an important moment in his turnaround tale. Indeed, it will likely be recalled as the day SoftBank revealed it had sold all 32.1 million of its Nvidia shares \u2013 not to diversify its bets but instead to double down elsewhere, including on a planned $30 billion commitment to OpenAI and to participate (it reportedly hopes) in a $1 trillion AI manufacturing hub in Arizona.\nIf selling that position still gives Son some heartburn, that\u2019s understandable. At about $181.58 per share, SoftBank exited just 14% below Nvidia\u2019s all-time high of $212.19, which is a strong look. That\u2019s remarkably close to peak valuation for such a huge position. Still, the move marks SoftBank\u2019s second complete exit from Nvidia, and the first one was exceedingly costly. (In 2019, SoftBank sold a $4 billion stake in the company for $3.6 billion, shares that would now be worth more than $150 billion.)\nThe move also rattled the market. As of this writing, Nvidia shares are down nearly 3% following the disclosure, even as analysts emphasize that the sale \u201cshould not be seen as a cautious or negative stance on Nvidia,\u201d but rather reflects SoftBank needing capital for its AI ambitions.\nWall Street can\u2019t help but wonder: does Son see something right now that others do not? Judging by his track record, maybe \u2014 and that ambiguity is all investors have to go on.\n\ntitle1:\nEU considers law to phase out Huawei and ZTE equipment from bloc's telecom networks\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nThe European Commission is stepping up efforts to bolster the security of Europe\u2019s telecommunications networks by urging member states to phase out equipment from vendors such as Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE from its 5G and next-gen networks, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.\nThe EC had in 2020 recommended that member nations stop using tech from \u201chigh-risk\u201d vendors like Huawei and ZTE, and now its vice president, Henna Virkkunen, is pushing to turn that recommendation into regulation, Bloomberg reported.\nVirkkunen\u2019s proposal could push EU countries to follow the Commission\u2019s security guidance more closely. If the recommendations become legally binding, member states that ignore the rules might face infringement procedures and even financial penalties, the report said. Virkkunen is looking at limiting Chinese vendors\u2019 involvement in fiber network projects amid a push for faster broadband rollout.\nHuawei and ZTE did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe move comes amid a broader effort to limit China\u2019s influence in key infrastructure as EU\u2019s ties fray with the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Last year, Germany\u2019s top security official said that, starting in 2026, the country would prohibit the use of key components from Chinese firms ZTE and Huawei. In addition, Finland reportedly plans to broaden the scope of its ban on the use of Huawei components in 5G networks.\nIn recent years, the U.S. has persuaded European allies like the U.K. and Sweden to restrict or ban Huawei gear over concerns that Beijing could exploit it for cyber-espionage or disrupt critical communications.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle Pixel update adds battery-saving maps mode, AI photo remixing, and smarter notifications\ndescription2:\nGoogle announced its November software update for Pixel phones, called Pixel Drop \u2014 a quarterly feature release that brings new capabilities to existing devices \u2014 with features including notification summaries, a power-saving mode for the Maps app, prompt-based edits for Photos, and Gemini Nano-powered photo edits in Messages.\nApple introduced notification summaries with its Apple Intelligence suite of features last year. Now, Google is catching up with its own notification summaries for longer chats and conversations on Pixel 9 and later devices. The company said that in December, it will roll out a feature that would silence low-priority notifications. By comparison, Apple has a Priority Notification feature that highlights important notifications.\nImage credits: Google\nGoogle is introducing a new low-power mode for its Maps app that will darken the screen and only show important information, including the navigation route and details of the next turn. The company said that with this feature, which will be available to Pixel 10 series users, you can save up to four hours of battery life.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe company previously introduced scam detection for phone calls using Gemini Nano and on-device speech detection for users in the U.S. with Pixel 9 and later models. It is now expanding this feature to users in the U.K., Ireland, India, Australia, and Canada.\nGoogle is also adding a way to indicate when a message is potentially a scam, by including a \u201cLikely a scam\u201d button in the notification for the message. This builds on the company\u2019s existing feature that analyzes a message\u2019s content and detects spam or scam.\nThe company\u2019s Nano Banana image model has been popular among users. It is now adding a feature called Remix, powered by that model along with Gemini in the Messages app, which lets you use a photo and reimagine it using prompts. The feature is being rolled out to users in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, and New Zealand with RCS enabled and support for the English language.\nGoogle added a Pixel VIPs feature in June that let\u2019s you designate eight of your closest contacts and get updates from them through a home screen widget. With the November Pixel Drop, notifications from these contacts will be prioritized. Plus, if an incident like a flood has occurred in area they live in, you would see a crisis badge in the contacts widget.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The startup says it tailors the platform to each market it serves, fine-tuning for language, cultural norms, and regulatory environments, and even organizes local teams to manage deployment.\nThat approach has led to rapid growth for the young startup, which claims its AI agents are already managing tens of thousands of customer requests daily with an 80% resolve rate. Since launching, Wonderful has expanded to Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Greece, Poland, Romania, the Baltics, the Adriatics and the UAE.\nWith its fresh funding, Wonderful intends to launch in Germany, Austria, the Nordics and Portugal in 2025, and plans to expand in the Asia-Pacific region in early 2026. But the company doesn\u2019t intend to stop with customer support agents.\nSince its system plugs deeply into an enterprise customer\u2019s existing software and can be tailored for each market, the startup says it will be able to give agents the capabilities to perform new tasks with minimal extra effort. It is currently exploring areas like employee training, sales enablement, regulatory compliance, internal IT support, and onboarding, the company said.\n\u201cThe promise of AI agents is clear, but putting that into practice, and critically, into production, is a huge challenge,\u201d Bar Winkler, CEO and co-founder of Wonderful, said in a statement. \u201cIt requires marrying best-in-class technology together with flawless delivery, on the ground with customers. That\u2019s been our approach with Wonderful, and it\u2019s what has driven the accelerated adoption we\u2019ve seen across markets in the last few months.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nCustomer-facing AI agents are emerging as the first real beachhead for the technology, and investors were likely attracted by Wonderful\u2019s focus here. These use cases help enterprises cut costs by augmenting or replacing human support staff, and they integrate readily into existing call centre infrastructure. Crucially, they also carry less risk than having an AI make internal decisions autonomously \u2014 a use case that most enterprises aren\u2019t ready to adopt at scale yet.\nIndex Ventures partner Hannah Seal pointed to Wonderful\u2019s ability to \u201c[move] from concept to global scale in less than a year\u201d as a source of confidence for investors. The company\u2019s true edge, she said, is its ability to deploy agents for global enterprises that function across every market and language.\nJeff Horing, co-founder and managing director at Insight Partners, said the adoption Wonderful is seeing across industries shows \u201cjust how valuable culturally fluent agents can be.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
