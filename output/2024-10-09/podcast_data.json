Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Discovery\u2019s movie studio in Burbank, California, and we\u2019ve got details on how to watch it here.\nMusk had originally planned to reveal the Robotaxi \u2013 which he has also referred to as a Cybercab \u2013 on August 8. That\u2019s a deadline Musk set for himself and Tesla a few hours after a Reuters report found that the automaker shelved its plan to build a lower-cost EV and would instead focus its resources on a robotaxi.\nWhile Musk initially accused Reuters of lying, over the next couple of weeks, Tesla indeed laid off 10% of staff to usher in a \u201cnext phase of growth,\u201d and Musk said Tesla would be going \u201cballs to the wall for autonomy.\u201d\nTesla has seldom stuck to Musk\u2019s timelines, and as expected, this Robotaxi event ended up getting pushed back to October after Musk requested \u201can important design change to the front.\u201d\nInvestors who have backed Tesla\u2019s vision for autonomy have been waiting for Tesla to finally reveal a Robotaxi. But the timing might not be great. Tesla\u2019s margins have taken a hit over the past year or so due to ramped up Cybertruck production, among other factors. Its third-quarter deliveries were somewhat disappointing, and Tesla has issued its fifth Cybertruck recall within a year of launching the vehicle.\nA new vehicle would mean more investment into production lines, factory downtime, and other potentially costly issues \u2013 things investors don\u2019t love to hear about.\nWhether it\u2019s all hype or at least some substance, we will soon find out. But here\u2019s what we expect to see.\nA Cybercab prototype\nImage Credits:Elon Musk biography by Walter Isaacson\nThe main thing we expect to see is a prototype for a new vehicle concept, which will be Tesla\u2019s first since it announced the Cybertruck back in November 2019.\nMusk has referred to the robotaxi as a Cybercab, which seems to confirm the design concept revealed last year in Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of the executive \u2013 a two-door, two-seater, Cybertruck-like compact vehicle, complete with angular edges and a stainless steel finish.\nThe vehicle will also likely be built without a steering wheel or pedals. While Tesla engineers have advocated against this at launch, Musk has been firm in his desire to bring a purpose-built vehicle to market, per Isaacson\u2019s book.\nTesla may run up against regulatory issues for that design choice, which don\u2019t align with federal motor safety standards, and we partly expect Musk to use that as a reason why getting the Cybercab to market will be difficult.\nTesla\u2019s lead designer, Franz Von Holzhausen, told TechCrunch\u2019s Kirsten Korosec that the company\u2019s existing vehicle portfolio has laid the foundation for what\u2019s to come with the Robotaxi.\n\u201cIn a strange sort of way, we\u2019ve been working our way \u2014 in a very public way \u2014 to what an autonomous future will look like,\u201d Von Holzhausen said. \u201cSo you see the big interface that we have, the way it\u2019s configurable and upgradable, and we bring a variety of entertainment pieces to it, and some humor as well. And I think that will continue to evolve.\u201d\nSmoke and mirrors\nWarner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2023. Warner Bros Discovery Inc. released earnings figures on Aug. 3. Photographer: Eric Thayer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Image Credits:Getty Images\nTesla usually hosts its big reveal events at one of its facilities, so the Hollywood studio choice is a step-change that signals Musk\u2019s showmanship will be on display.\nThe studio in question is open to the public for tours, so visitors (who are mainly Tesla shareholders and superfans) will get the chance to be dazzled by the sets of Batman, Friends, Gilmore Girls, The Big Bang Theory, Harry Potter and other titles.\nIt also allows Tesla to take advantage of the large sound stages and sets, some of which resemble a slice of suburbia and even a small downtown area. This could be the perfect place for Tesla to do a demo of its Cybercab in autonomous action \u2013 it\u2019s a controlled, closed environment with no other traffic where the car will be able to drive itself at low speed.\nWe think the demo could feature the ride-hailing app that Tesla teased during its first-quarter earnings call in April.\nOther vehicle and product announcements\nScreenshot from Tesla\u2019s March 2023 investor presentation. Image Credits:Tesla\nThe title of the event, \u201cWe, Robot\u201d, is a nod to Isaac Asimov\u2019s series of science fiction short stories called \u201cI, Robot\u201d which explores the relationship between robots and humans. As such, many believe the event will feature updates on Optimus, Tesla\u2019s humanoid robot. That said, Asimov\u2019s stories revolve around three laws of robotics that prioritize human safety \u2013 1) A robot may not injure a human being or allow a human to be injured through inaction; 2) A robot must obey orders given by a human being unless that conflicts with the first law; 3) A robot must protect its own existence unless that contradicts the first and second laws. Those fit neatly into autonomous driving.\nDeepwater Asset Management predicts that in addition to a Cybercab prototype, Tesla will provide previews (but crucially not a prototype) for the $25,000 EV, which fans are calling the Model 2. Analysts Gene Munster and Brian Baker said they expect the Model 2 to have a similar look and feel to the Cybercab, likely based on past comments from Tesla that the two would share a vehicle platform.\nThe firm also thinks Tesla will provide more details on a Cybervan, a fully autonomous passenger van that could in the future augment public transportation. This prediction is based on Tesla\u2019s March 2023 investor presentation that featured a lineup of Tesla\u2019s current and future vehicles, including a teaser of a van-sized car.\nSome potential wildcards\nBuilding a robotaxi is one thing. Commercializing it is another. Tesla may be able to rely on the uniqueness of its vehicles and the company\u2019s general fan power to attract customers for a ride-hail service, but many won\u2019t want to make the switch to a service that will likely be less reliable at launch.\nOne wildcard prediction we have is that Tesla could announce a partnership with Uber, which has demonstrated that its existing global ride-hail platform is attractive to autonomous vehicle companies. Over the past few weeks, Uber has been signing on AV companies at a rapid clip, including Waymo, Cruise, Wayve, and others. While Musk seems to want to go it alone, partnering might be the best way to actually commercialize these vehicles.\nAnother potential wildcard is that McDonald\u2019s is involved in this somehow, based on an X post from the fast food chain last week that said, \u201cchat\u2019s about to pop off 10.10.\u201d Musk replied with the laugh-crying emoji, so we might expect to see some kind of autonomous food delivery demo or announcement with McDonald\u2019s on Thursday.\n\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 2, 2024\nWhat we don\u2019t expect to see\nThere will be plenty of hype and chatter about Musk\u2019s vision of an autonomous future, during which the executive will likely make the same argument that Uber made a decade ago about the possibilities for shared rides \u2013 it will be so easy and cheap to hail an AV, that people won\u2019t need to own their own vehicles.\nA rosy picture, but one that we don\u2019t expect to be backed up Thursday with a clear path to commercialization.\nIn the past, Musk has said Tesla vehicles on the roads today would be able to progress to autonomy with merely a software update, allowing owners to add their cars to Tesla\u2019s ride-sharing app and rent them out to make extra cash. Tesla has said it would take something like 25% to 30% of the revenue from those rides, and in places where there aren\u2019t enough people to share cars, the automaker would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis.\nMusk has been promising a fully autonomous Tesla for years now, but has yet to introduce one. Despite Tesla\u2019s advancements in its advanced driver assistance system, named Full Self-Driving (FSD), the tech is still not fully self-driving. It requires a human driver to be attentive behind the wheel and take over if needed.\nThis might be why Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who is an undeniable Tesla bull, said he expects Tesla will offer a \u201c\u2018dual\u2019 approach with respect to autonomous ridesharing.\u201d There will be a \u2018supervised\u2019 autonomous/FSD rideshare service, and a fully autonomous app-based Cybercab, he said, with an expected initial commercial launch slated for late 2025 or 2026.\nWhen it comes to production of the Cybercabs themselves, the analysts at Deepwater point to the lag between Tesla\u2019s unveiling of products and ramping production. The minimum gap of 10 months was with the Model Y, whereas the Cybertruck took 48 months, and the Semi is at 79 months and counting. Tesla delivered a handful of Semis in December 2022, but has yet to ramp up to volume production.\n\u201cThis suggests the start of production for any of the vehicles announced in August would begin in June of 2025 at the earliest,\u201d Deepwater wrote.\nAnd since the robotaxi event got pushed back so Tesla could \u201cmake some important changes,\u201d then the product is still likely a long way off from being ready to go to production.\nThis article has been updated to include comments from Tesla\u2019s lead designer. It was originally published October 8 at 12:22 pm PT.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia stock up 25% in a month as stock closes in on new record\ndescription1:\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang presents \"Blackwell\" at an event ahead of the Computex forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024.\nNvidia shares have surged 25% in the last month and are closing in on a record ahead of tech earnings season in the coming weeks, when top customers like Meta , Microsoft and Alphabet will update shareholders on their expected investments in artificial intelligence.\nFollowing a brief but dramatic dip in late August and early September, Nvidia has rebounded sharply. The stock closed down slightly on Wednesday at $132.65, just shy of its closing high of $135.58 reached in June. Nvidia has surpassed Microsoft as the second-most valuable company, behind only Apple .\nNvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI boom, as companies including Meta , OpenAI, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle continue to unveil technologies and products that require hefty investments in its graphics processing units, or GPUs.\nIn August, Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that showed revenue rose 122% year over year while net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion. The company also gave stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and said it expects to ship several billion dollars worth of its new Blackwell AI chip. Demand is so high that Nvidia anticipates shipments for its current-generation Hopper chip to increase over the next two quarters.\n\"We see NVDA remaining the leader in the AI training and inference chips for Data Center applications,\" Mizuho analysts said in a note Wednesday, estimating that the company has about 95% market share. The analysts have a $140 price target on the stock but noted risks in potentially escalating export restrictions to China, geopolitical tensions regarding Taiwan or a significant pullback in AI server spending.\n\"Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview last week on CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime,\" speaking of the \"insane\" demand for the Blackwell chip. Production for the GPU, which will cost between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit, is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter and continue into fiscal 2026.\nThe stock rallied for other reasons over the last month, too. Nvidia shares jumped 4% on Sept. 23, after a filing showed Huang finished selling the company's stock.\n\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.\nCorrection: Nvidia's closing high of $135.58 was reached in June. An earlier version misstated the month.\n\ntitle2:\nDOJ indicates it\u2019s considering Google breakup following monopoly ruling\ndescription2:\nU.S. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter speaks about the antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment during a press conference as Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco look on during a press conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, U.S., May 23, 2024. REUTERS/Ken Cedeno\nThe Department of Justice late Tuesday made recommendations for Google's search engine business practices, indicating that it was considering a possible breakup of the tech giant as an antitrust remedy.\nThe remedies necessary to \"prevent and restrain monopoly maintenance could include contract requirements and prohibitions; non-discrimination product requirements; data and interoperability requirements; and structural requirements,\" the department said in a filing.\nThe DOJ also said it was \"considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features \u2014 including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence \u2014 over rivals or new entrants.\"\nAdditionally, the DOJ suggested limiting or prohibiting default agreements and \"other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products.\" That would include Google's search position agreements with Apple's iPhone and Samsung devices \u2014 deals that cost the company billions of dollars a year in payouts. The agency suggested one way to do this is requiring a \"choice screen,\" which could allow users to pick from other search engines.\nSuch remedies would end \"Google's control of distribution today\" and ensure \"Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow.\"\nThe recommendations come after a U.S. judge in August ruled that Google holds a monopoly in the search market. That ruling came after the government in 2020 filed the landmark case, alleging that Google has kept its share of the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance. The court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies.\nKent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, said the company plans to appeal the ruling and highlighted the court's emphasis on the high quality of Google's search products, which the judge also noted in his ruling.\nThe DOJ also recommended Google make available to competitors its data within its search index and models, including its AI-assisted search features and its ad ranking data. The DOJ is also considering remedies that would \"prohibit Google from using or retraining data that cannot be effectively shared with others on the basis of privacy concerns,\" according to the filing.\nThe recommendations are still far from being decided.\nJudge Amit Mehta said he'll aim to rule on the remedies by August 2025 and an appeal by Google would likely draw out any final impact potentially years.\nIn response to the Tuesday filing, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland, called the DOJ's recommendations \"radical.\"\n\"This case is about a set of search distribution contracts,\" Mulholland said in a blog post. \"Rather than focus on that, the government seems to be pursuing a sweeping agenda that will impact numerous industries and products, with significant unintended consequences for consumers, businesses, and American competitiveness.\"\nShe added that \"splitting off Chrome or Android would break them \u2014 and many other things.\"\nThe most likely outcome, according to some legal experts, is that the court will ask Google to do away with certain exclusive agreements such that it has with Apple. The court may suggest that Google make it easier for users to try other search engines, experts told CNBC. However, a breakup seems less likely, the experts said.\nIn the second quarter, \"Google Search & Other\" accounted for $48.5 billion in revenue, or 57% of Alphabet's total revenue. The company holds 90% of search market share.\nIn a separate antitrust case this week, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play store for downloading apps on Android phones.\nA judge in September wrapped a trial for another antitrust case brought on by the DOJ \u2014 though this one homed in on Google's ad tech business.\n\ntitle3:\nBaidu to expand Apollo Go robotaxi service outside of China\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nBaidu, the Google of China, will roll out its driverless ride-hailing service overseas as it seeks to compete with the dearth of autonomous vehicle companies at home.\nThe Beijing-based company seeks to deploy its Apollo Go robotaxi service in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Middle East, sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. A source familiar with the matter confirmed its expansion outside of China but couldn\u2019t say which markets.\nChinese AV companies have dealt with roadblocks domestically \u2014 they\u2019re facing the perfect storm of a high capital expenditure business model with too much competition and dwindling foreign investment. Countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with their endless oil money and smart city goals, have already been the target of Baidu competitors Pony.ai and WeRide.\nBaidu\u2019s expansion plan involves entering new markets through technology and automotive partnerships. It has already partnered with Hyundai, Kia, and Nissan to develop connected car technology, so Japan could be another potential market for Baidu\u2019s Apollo Go.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI says more cyber actors using its platform to disrupt elections\ndescription4:\nOpenAI is increasingly becoming a platform of choice for cyber actors looking to influence democratic elections across the globe.\nIn a 54-page report published Wednesday, the ChatGPT creator said that it's disrupted \"more than 20 operations and deceptive networks from around the world that attempted to use our models.\" The threats ranged from AI-generated website articles to social media posts by fake accounts.\nThe company said its update on \"influence and cyber operations\" was intended to provide a \"snapshot\" of what it's seeing and to identify \"an initial set of trends that we believe can inform debate on how AI fits into the broader threat landscape.\"\nOpenAI's report lands less than a month before the U.S. presidential election. Beyond the U.S., it's a significant year for elections worldwide, with contests taking place that affect upward of 4 billion people in more than 40 countries. The rise of AI-generated content has led to serious election-related misinformation concerns, with the number of deepfakes that have been created increasing 900% year over year, according to data from Clarity, a machine learning firm.\nMisinformation in elections is not a new phenomenon. It's been a major problem dating back to the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, when Russian actors found cheap and easy ways to spread false content across social platforms. In 2020, social networks were inundated with misinformation on Covid vaccines and election fraud.\nLawmakers' concerns today are more focused on the rise in generative AI, which took off in late 2022 with the launch of ChatGPT and is now being adopted by companies of all sizes.\nOpenAI wrote in its report that election-related uses of AI \"ranged in complexity from simple requests for content generation, to complex, multi-stage efforts to analyze and reply to social media posts.\" The social media content related mostly to elections in the U.S. and Rwanda, and to a lesser extent, elections in India and the EU, OpenAI said.\nIn late August, an Iranian operation used OpenAI's products to generate \"long-form articles\" and social media comments about the U.S. election, as well as other topics, but the company said the majority of identified posts received few or no likes, shares and comments. In July, the company banned ChatGPT accounts in Rwanda that were posting election-related comments on X. And in May, an Israeli company used ChatGPT to generate social media comments about elections in India. OpenAI wrote that it was able to address the case within less than 24 hours.\nIn June, OpenAI addressed a covert operation that used its products to generate comments about the European Parliament elections in France, and politics in the U.S., Germany, Italy and Poland. The company said that while most social media posts it identified received few likes or shares, some real people did reply to the AI-generated posts.\nNone of the election-related operations were able to attract \"viral engagement\" or build \"sustained audiences\" via the use of ChatGPT and OpenAI's other tools, the company wrote.\nWATCH: Outlook of election could be positive or very negative for China\"\n\nResponse:",
