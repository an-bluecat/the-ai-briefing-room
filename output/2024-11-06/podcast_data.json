And late today, in a post on X, he confirmed that OpenAI was that buyer \u2014 implying that he\u2019d been paid in OpenAI shares.\nThe domain name doesn\u2019t appear to have changed hands since it sold last year, indicating that OpenAI isn\u2019t hosting ChatGPT on Chat.com \u2014 so this probably doesn\u2019t represent a brand change.\nOpenAI declined to say how much it paid for Chat.com.\n\ntitle2:\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong $2 billion richer on election stock pop\ndescription2:\nIn this article COIN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nBrian Armstrong, co-founder and chief executive officer of Coinbase Inc., speaks during the Singapore Fintech Festival, in Singapore, on Friday, Nov. 4, 2022. Bryan van der Beek | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nElection Day proved hugely successful for the crypto industry. Nobody was a bigger winner than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Coinbase shares soared 31% on Wednesday, their best day on record, as investors celebrated the company's victorious efforts to get pro-crypto candidates into office. Fairshake, the Coinbase-backed PAC, says that of the 58 candidates it supported, 46 won, with the remaining contests 12 still undecided. Armstrong, who co-founded Coinbase in 2012 and took it public in 2021, remains the crypto exchange's biggest investor, with ownership of well over 10% of the company's outstanding shares. As of the latest proxy filing, he owned 34.8 million Class A and Class B shares, a stake that jumped by about $2.1 billion in value on Wednesday to almost $9 billion. \"Being anti-crypto is simply bad politics,\" Armstrong wrote in a post on X, after Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno was declared the winner in his state's Senate race over incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. In a lengthier follow-up post on Wednesday, Armstrong said \"no matter how you slice it, this election was huge win for crypto.\" Bitcoin jumped over 9.5%, reaching a record of over $76,400. A Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment further.\nwatch now\nSome $40 million of crypto money was directed at defeating Brown, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. One PAC paid for five ads designed to boost awareness of Moreno, a blockchain entrepreneur with very little name recognition entering the race. The Stand With Crypto Alliance, which Coinbase launched last year, gave Brown an \"F\" grade, while it issued Moreno an \"A.\" Moreno flipped the seat, winning 50.3% of votes cast to 46.3% for Moreno, according to NBC News. His win helped ensure a majority for the Republicans in Senate, alongside Republican nominee Donald Trump's victory in the presidential contest. \"I am so grateful to Ohioans for their resounding support in this race,\" Moreno said in a statement Tuesday night. \"I look forward to working with the new Republican Senate majority to fix our economy, secure our border, and return to American strength at home and abroad.\" Moreno's statement made no mention of crypto, despite the fact that the industry bankrolled his campaign.\nPolitics pays off\nFor Armstrong, politics has become a big part of the job as his company fights for a friendlier Washington and more amenable regulatory environment. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler sued Coinbase last year over claims that it sells unregistered securities. A judge has since ruled that the case should be heard by a jury. Coinbase has fought back vociferously, and has also said that it wants to work with regulators to come up with a proper set of laws governing the nascent industry.\nRepublican nominee for U.S. Senate Bernie Moreno addresses supporters at Brecksville Community Center on November 4, 2024 in Brecksville, Ohio. Stephen Maturen | Getty Images\nArmstrong told CNBC in September that his visits to the nation's capital used to take place once or twice a year. Then it got to be at least a quarterly occasion. And the pace has only increased. \"In the beginning, a lot of people didn't know what crypto was,\" Armstrong said of his earlier trips. Now, \"the discussion has advanced, really, to, how do we pass clear rules, create legislation in the United States?\" In the 2024 election cycle, Coinbase was one of the top corporate donors, giving more than $75 million to Fairshake and its affiliate PACs, including a fresh pledge of $25 million to support the pro-crypto super PAC in the 2026 midterms. Armstrong personally contributed more than $1.3 million to a mix of candidates up and down the ballot. Coinbase stayed out of the presidential contest and focused its finances exclusively on congressional races, in an effort to assemble a group of lawmakers with favorable views of the industry. Coinbase's big post-election pop more than makes up for the 15% drop in the stock last week after the company reported disappointing quarterly results due to lower transaction revenue and a drop in subscriptions services revenue. Paul Grewal, Coinbase's chief legal officer, attended multiple fundraisers for Trump in the months before the election. As the results were rolling in Tuesday, Grewal said in a post on X that he hopes the SEC \"understands what has happened tonight.\" \"Stop suing crypto,\" Grewal wrote. \"Start talking to crypto. Initiate rulemaking now. There's no reason to wait.\" Armstrong reposted the Grewal's comments, adding one word of his own: \"True.\" WATCH: Next congress will be 'most pro-crypto congress' ever\n\ntitle3:\nBitcoin hits record $76,000 as Trump victory heralds weaker regulation\ndescription3:\nShares of Coinbase surged 31.11%, posting its best day on record since its first day of trading . MicroStrategy , which trades as a high beta play on the price of bitcoin, advanced 13%.\nEther surged 11%, while the token tied to its competitor, Solana , rocketed 13%. Payments token XRP jumped more than 5%. Meanwhile, memecoins soared , with dogecoin up more than 15%.\n\"The themes around the Trump trade for crypto are deregulation, potential tax cuts for an asset that is both held long term but also day traded, less dependency on parts of government like financial institutions and the Fed \u2014 or at least an alternative for decentralized currency \u2014 and overall support of risk assets and the growth of crypto ... is really what's making it grow,\" Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs, told CNBC.\nThe price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 9% at about $76,052.66, according to Coin Metrics, after touching a fresh record of $76,493.86.\nCoinbase is on pace for its best day on record back to its direct listing in April 2021.\nWhile bitcoin is benefitting from its inflation hedge narrative, investors of other cryptocurrencies and Coinbase are betting the U.S. regulatory environment will be more supportive of the crypto industry, as promised by Trump on the campaign trail.\nVoters in this election were concerned about the state of the government deficit, which rose 8% in the 2024 fiscal year to $1.8 trillion, and increased tax cuts promised by both Trump and Harris. Bitcoin, like gold, is seen by many investors as a hedge against the potential for fiscal and monetary policy that combine to reduce the value of the dollar and lift inflation.\nTrump had presented himself as the pro-crypto candidate early in the race and courted the industry directly. That included declarations that he would install a crypto advisory council in his first 100 days in office, establish favorable regulation to encourage domestic \"made in the USA\" bitcoin mining, launch a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and \u2013 what perhaps resonated most strongly with the industry \u2013 replace Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler.\nGensler has become an adversary to the crypto industry, which has long been frustrated with the refusal of the SEC, under his leadership, to provide clear guidance for U.S. crypto businesses \u2013 choosing instead to regulate by enforcement, the industry says. Because of that, largely, this year's presidential election has been called the most important one in the crypto industry's lifetime.\n\"While President-elect Trump has claimed to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital' of the world, the details of his plans remain to be seen, and I expect it to take some time to truly understand his stance towards crypto,\" said Anthony Yeung, global head of strategic development at CoinCover.\n\"It's in the interest of the industry that the U.S. moves sooner rather than later when it comes to crafting a regulatory framework,\" he said. \"What it needs is targeted and proportionate regulation that prioritizes consumer protection and encourages innovation. Striking this balance will require close collaboration between regulators, policy makers and industry participants.\"\nIn the 2012, 2016 and 2020 elections, bitcoin saw returns of roughly 87%, 44% and 145% in the 90 days following election day, respectively. That's in part because election years happen to fall on Bitcoin halving years, when the supply of the cryptocurrency ratchets downward. Post election returns have also tended to align with major Federal Reserve policy shifts. This year, the market is looking forward to further interest rate reductions.\"\n\nResponse:",
