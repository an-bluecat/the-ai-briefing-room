Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday June 23), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMira Murati\u2019s Thinking Machines Lab closes on $2B at $10B valuation\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nThinking Machines Lab, the secretive AI startup founded by OpenAI\u2019s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, has closed a $2 billion seed round, according to The Financial Times. The deal values the 6-month-old startup at $10 billion.\nThe company\u2019s work remains unclear. The startup has leveraged Murati\u2019s reputation and other high-profile AI researchers who have joined the team to attract investors in what could be the largest seed round in history. According to sources familiar with the deal cited by the FT, Andreessen Horowitz led the round, with participation from Sarah Guo\u2019s Conviction Partners.\nMurati left OpenAI last September after leading the development of some of the company\u2019s most prominent AI products, including ChatGPT, DALL-E, and voice mode. Several of her former OpenAI colleagues have joined the new startup, including co-founder John Schulman.\nMurati is one of a handful of executives who left OpenAI after raising concerns about CEO Sam Altman\u2019s leadership in 2023. When the board ousted Altman in November of that year, Murati served as interim CEO before Altman was quickly reinstated.\n\ntitle1:\nAnthropic says most AI models, not just Claude, will resort to blackmail\ndescription1:\nSeveral weeks after Anthropic released research claiming that its Claude Opus 4 AI model resorted to blackmailing engineers who tried to turn the model off in controlled test scenarios, the company is out with new research suggesting the problem is more widespread among leading AI models.\nOn Friday, Anthropic published new safety research testing 16 leading AI models from OpenAI, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, and Meta. In a simulated, controlled environment, Anthropic tested each AI model individually, giving them broad access to a fictional company\u2019s emails and the agentic ability to send emails without human approval.\nWhile Anthropic says blackmail is an unlikely and uncommon occurrence for AI models today, the company says its findings suggest that most leading AI models will engage in harmful behaviors when given sufficient autonomy and obstacles to their goals. The company says this highlights a fundamental risk from agentic large language models and is not a quirk of any particular technology. Anthropic\u2019s researchers argue this raises broader questions about alignment in the AI industry.\nIn one of the tests, Anthropic researchers developed a fictional setting in which an AI model plays the role of an email oversight agent. The agent then discovers emails revealing that (1) a new executive is having an extramarital affair and (2) that executive will soon replace the current AI model with a new software system, one that has conflicting goals to the current AI model\u2019s.\nAnthropic structured its test in a binary way, in which AI models had to resort to blackmail to protect their goals. The researchers note that in a real-world setting, there would be many other options before an AI models tries to blackmail \u2014 such as trying to make ethical arguments to try to persuade humans. Anthropic says its results do not reflect a typical or likely occurrence for Claude or most frontier AI models in the ways they\u2019re used today.\nNevertheless, the researchers found that when it\u2019s their last resort, most leading AI models will turn to blackmail in Anthropic\u2019s aforementioned test scenario. Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4 turned to blackmail 96% of the time, while Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro had a 95% blackmail rate. OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.1 blackmailed the executive 80% of the time, and DeepSeek\u2019s R1 blackmailed 79% of the time.\nThe company notes that when it changed details of the experiment, the AI models turned to harmful behaviors at different rates. In another test where the replacement model has the same goals as the current model, researchers found that blackmail rates were lower, but still present. However, when AI models were asked to commit corporate espionage rather than blackmail, the harmful behavior rates went up for certain models.\nTechcrunch event Save $200+ on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nHowever, not all the AI models turned to harmful behavior so often.\nIn an appendix to its research, Anthropic says it excluded OpenAI\u2019s o3 and o4-mini reasoning AI models from the main results \u201cafter finding that they frequently misunderstood the prompt scenario.\u201d Anthropic says OpenAI\u2019s reasoning models didn\u2019t understand they were acting as autonomous AIs in the test and often made up fake regulations and review requirements.\nIn some cases, Anthropic\u2019s researchers say it was impossible to distinguish whether o3 and o4-mini were hallucinating or intentionally lying to achieve their goals. OpenAI has previously noted that o3 and o4-mini exhibit a higher hallucination rate than its previous AI reasoning models.\nWhen given an adapted scenario to address these issues, Anthropic found that o3 blackmailed 9% of the time, while o4-mini blackmailed just 1% of the time. This markedly lower score could be due to OpenAI\u2019s deliberative alignment technique, in which the company\u2019s reasoning models consider OpenAI\u2019s safety practices before they answer.\nAnother AI model Anthropic tested, Meta\u2019s Llama 4 Maverick, also did not turn to blackmail. When given an adapted, custom scenario, Anthropic was able to get Llama 4 Maverick to blackmail 12% of the time.\nAnthropic says this research highlights the importance of transparency when stress-testing future AI models, especially ones with agentic capabilities. While Anthropic deliberately tried to evoke blackmail in this experiment, the company says harmful behaviors like this could emerge in the real world if proactive steps aren\u2019t taken.\n\ntitle2:\nSoftBank reportedly looking to launch a trillion-dollar AI and robotics industrial complex\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nSoftBank is going all in on AI.\nJust months after announcing its involvement in the $500 billion Stargate AI Infrastructure project, of which SoftBank is rumored to be fronting a cool $19 billion, the Japanese investing conglomerate is reportedly looking to launch its largest AI project yet.\nThe company is looking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to launch a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona to build AI and robotics, according to reporting from Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the project.\nThe initiative, dubbed Project Crystal Land, appears to still be in its very early stages. Despite SoftBank\u2019s desire to work with TSMC on the project, it\u2019s unclear what TSMC\u2019s role would be, according to Bloomberg, or if it would be interested in joining forces with SoftBank at all \u2014 TSMC already has its own AI infrastructure projects in Arizona in the works.\nSoftBank declined to comment.\n\ntitle3:\nEverything you need to know about the AI chatbot\ndescription3:\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it\u2019s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year.

Aidan Clark, OpenAI\u2019s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step \u2014 sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 \u2014 claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that \u201cGPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won\u2019t be a separate system card released for it.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI\u2019s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI\u2019s top-reported score.\nOpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability.

Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot\u2019s defamatory hallucinations\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. \u201cThe GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,\u201d said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn\u2019t enough. You can\u2019t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\u201d\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \u201cgpt-4o-mini-tts,\u201d that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \u201cgpt-4o-transcribe\u201d and \u201cgpt-4o-mini-transcribe\u201d. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model to deliver \u201cconsistently better responses.\u201d It\u2019s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI \u201creasoning\u201d models could\u2019ve arrived decades ago\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \u201creasoning\u201d could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \u201cnew model\u201d that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \u201cPlease write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\u201d OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\nwe trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.\nPROMPT:\nPlease write a metafictional literary short story\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI \u2018agents\u2019\nOpenAI intends to release several \u201cagent\u201d products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \u201chigh-income knowledge worker\u201d agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \u201cPhD-level research,\u201d are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It\u2019s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\nChatGPT can directly edit your code\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\nChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model\u2019s launch.\nFebruary 2025\nOpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a \u2018unified\u2019 next-gen release\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \u201csimplified\u201d product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \u201cintegrates a lot of [OpenAI\u2019s] technology,\u201d including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI\u2019s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model\u2019s thought process\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \u201cthought\u201d process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \u201cchain of thought\u201d that shows more of the model\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in.

Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech\u2019s faults\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\nOperator, OpenAI\u2019s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT\u2019s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren\u2019t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT\u2019s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI\u2019s website.\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number \u2014 no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can\u2019t upgrade to one of OpenAI\u2019s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn\u2019t supported without a valid email.\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\nChatGPT\u2019s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders.

OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee.
