Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

At the time, Houston wrote that the cuts were due to slowing growth, economic headwinds and the need to invest more resources and head count into the increasingly competitive AI race.\nDropbox will be making cuts to the parts of its business where the company is \"over-invested or underperforming\" while working toward a \"flatter, more efficient\" team structure, Houston wrote.\n\"We continue to see softening demand and macro headwinds in our core business,\" Houston wrote. \"But external factors are only part of the story. We've heard from many of you that our organizational structure has become overly complex, with excess layers of management slowing us down.\"\nAffected employees will receive 16 weeks of pay, starting Wednesday, with one additional week of pay for each completed tenure year at the company.\nWATCH: How working for Big Tech lost 'dream job' status\n\ntitle1:\nAlphabet Q3 earnings report 2024\ndescription1:\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai speaks with Emily Chang during the APEC CEO Summit at Moscone Center West in San Francisco on Nov. 16, 2023.\nGoogle parent Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings that beat on top and bottom lines with strong revenue growth from the company's cloud unit.\nThe company's shares rose about 5% on Wednesday morning.\nHere are the results:\nEarnings per share: $2.12 vs. $1.85 expected by LSEG\n$2.12 vs. $1.85 expected by LSEG Revenue: $88.27 billion vs. $86.30 billion expected by LSEG\nHere are other numbers Wall Street was watching:\nYouTube advertising revenue : $8.92 billion vs. $8.89 billion, according to StreetAccount\n: $8.92 billion vs. $8.89 billion, according to StreetAccount Google Cloud revenue: $11.35 billion vs. $10.88 billion, according to StreetAccount\n$11.35 billion vs. $10.88 billion, according to StreetAccount Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.72 billion vs. $13.53 billion, according to StreetAccount\nAlphabet's revenue grew 15% year over year, which is stronger than the same quarter last year.\nThe company reported blowout cloud revenue at $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from the $8.41 billion a year ago. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its artificial intelligence offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai opened his call with investors saying the company's \"full stack\" of AI products is now operating at scale and being used by Google's billions of users and \"creating a virtuous cycle.\"\nThe search company's strong quarter kicks off a big week of earnings for tech's megacap companies. Meta and Microsoft report on Wednesday, followed by Apple and Amazon on Thursday.\nAlphabet's net income increased to $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share, compared to $19.7 billion, or $1.55 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\nGoogle's search business generated $49.4 billion in revenue. That was up 12.3% from a year ago, and the search business remains the largest contributor to revenue growth for the company, said Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi on the call.\n\ntitle2:\nApple updates MacBook Pro laptops with new chips, more memory for AI\ndescription2:\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference at Apple Park campus in Cupertino, California, on June 10, 2024.\nApple on Wednesday introduced new MacBook Pro laptops with updated processors, in what is likely the company's last major hardware announcement of the year.\nThe new devices are equipped with Apple's latest chip, the M4. Some models have access to more powerful versions, called the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Apple says the new chips are 1.8 times faster than the M1, which powered Apple's 2021 MacBook Pro.\nApple has also made a significant change across its entire Mac lineup to prepare the computers for future artificial intelligence features.\nApple said the new models, like all devices released this year, are designed for Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system that can generate text, images and emojis.\nAdditionally, all of the new MacBook Pro models come with at least 16GB of RAM. Until now, low-end Macs often came with 8GB of RAM by default. The more memory a computer has, the more it is capable of handling larger and more sophisticated AI models.\nApple's MacBook Air laptops and iMac desktops are also getting an update to start with at least 16GB of RAM at the same $999 starting price as before. The M4 also has improved AI capabilities. Doubling the RAM on its laptops represents the most significant change Apple has made to its lineup of computers to better support Apple Intelligence.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta Q3 earnings report 2024\ndescription3:\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled \"Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis,\" in the Dirksen building on Jan. 31, 2024.\nMeta reported weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025 in its third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.\nThe company's stock price was down slightly in after-hours trading.\nHere's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\nEarnings per share : $6.03 vs. $5.25 expected\n: $6.03 vs. $5.25 expected Revenue: $40.59 billion vs. $40.29 billion expected\nSales in the third quarter jumped 19% year over year while net income grew 35% to $15.7 billion from $11.6 billion a year earlier. That represents Meta's lowest year-over-year growth for net income since the second quarter of 2023.\nThe company reported 3.29 billion daily active people for the third quarter. That was up 5% year over year but came in below analysts' expectations of 3.31 billion.\nMeta also raised capital expenditures guidance for the 2024 fiscal year to between $38 billion and $40 billion, up from $37 billion to $40 billion previously. Additionally, the company said it expects capital expenditures to continue to grow significantly in 2025 due to an acceleration in infrastructure expenses.\n\"Our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there, too,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday on a call with analysts.\nZuckerberg has been pointing to the company's massive investments in artificial intelligence, which includes spending billions of dollars on Nvidia's popular graphics processing units, as helping improve the company's core online ad business in the aftermath of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update. The company has been improving upon and building more data centers to help provide the technology infrastructure needed for its AI strategy.\nMore than one million advertisers have used Meta's generative AI advertising tools, Zuckerberg said.\nMeta said it expects total expenses for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of between $96 billion and $98 billion, which is lower than previous guidance of $96 billion to $99 billion.\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $39.9 billion for the quarter, up 18.7% year over year. Advertising accounted for 98.3% of Meta's total revenue in the third quarter.\nRevenue from Meta's Asia-Pacific region grew 15%, representing the company's slowest-growing region, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on the call. That was down from growth of 28% in the second quarter, and Li attributed the deceleration to lapping demand from China advertisers. Investors were concerned that slower digital ad spending by China-linked online retailers such as Temu and Shein would affect Meta's overall revenue.\nMeta said it is expecting fourth-quarter revenue to be between $45 billion and $48 billion. The midpoint of that guidance is higher than the analyst consensus of $46.3 billion.\nThe company's Reality Labs hardware unit posted an operating loss of $4.4 billion in the third quarter, which was less than analysts' expectations of $4.68 billion. Sales in that unit jumped 29% year over year to $270 million in the third quarter, trailing analysts' expectations of $310.4 million.\nSince 2020, Meta's Reality Labs unit has recorded an operating loss of more than $58 billion.\nThe company's overall headcount grew 9% year over year to 72,404 as of Sept. 30.\nThe social media company's results come a day after digital ad companies Alphabet , Reddit and Snap all reported solid quarterly earnings. Microsoft reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat on the top and bottom lines.\nAlphabet on Tuesday said third-quarter sales from its Google Cloud unit came in at $11.35 billion, up 35% compared to a year prior. The company attributed its strong cloud results to its AI offerings, which include subscriptions for enterprise customers.\nMicrosoft on Wednesday reported that revenue from its Azure cloud unit was up 33% year over year, with 12 points coming from AI services.\nApple and Amazon report quarterly financials on Thursday.\n\ntitle4:\nAurora Innovation delays commercial autonomous truck launch to 2025\ndescription4:\nAutonomous vehicle technology startup Aurora Innovation is targeting April 2025 for commercial deployment of its autonomous trucks, pushing its timeline back by about a quarter. The company had originally planned to launch by the end of 2024. The company said it delayed the launch so it can continue to validate its self-driving technology.\n\u201cWhile this is modestly later than we had intended, this timing remains within the margin of error we have anticipated and conveyed throughout 2024,\u201d Aurora CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson wrote in his third-quarter earnings shareholder letter. \u201cWith our intention to introduce the Aurora Driver with a crawl, walk, run approach, this shift to our timeline will have a negligible financial impact.\u201d\nAurora will go to market as a carrier, but its end goal is to pursue a driver-as-a-service model, wherein carriers purchase trucks with the Aurora Driver tech on board and then offer their services via those trucks to shippers.\nOne of the ways Aurora measures the performance and commercial readiness of its Aurora Driver is its use of on-site support, which the company says will be the most expensive support provided. As of the end of the third-quarter, the Aurora Driver was delivering commercial loads without the support of a remote human 80% of the time, which is up 75% from the second-quarter. The goal is to reach 90% by commercial launch in the spring.\nThe startup intends to deploy up to 10 driverless trucks during commercial launch, with the goal of increasing to tens of trucks by the end of 2025.\nAurora has been testing commercial loads with pilot customers including FedEx, Werner, Schneider, Hirschbach, Uber Freight, and others. The company schedules roughly 160 commercial loads per week, which Aurora says is more than double the volume from last year. As of October 27, 2024, Aurora\u2019s trucks have autonomously delivered more than 8,200 loads and driven over 2.2 million commercial miles \u2013 but all with a human behind the wheel.\nAurora, a pre-revenue company building pioneer tech, recorded an operating expense of $196 million in the third quarter, including stock-based compensation of $35 million. That\u2019s less than the $212 million it spent in the same period last year, which Aurora says demonstrates its commitment to being frugal on its path to commercialization.\nThe startup ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments after raising almost half a billion dollars in August, which should give Aurora runway into 2026 and fund its initial stage of scaling and getting to a place of sustainability.\"\n\nResponse:",
