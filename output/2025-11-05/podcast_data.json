Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

For context, the current cloud-based version of Apple Intelligence uses 150 billion parameters, meaning Google\u2019s model would be roughly eight times more complex.\nApple had also considered using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic earlier this year. After testing models from all three companies, Apple chose to move forward with Google.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the overhauled Siri is expected to launch next spring. However, since the launch is still months away, plans for the revamp could change.\n\ntitle1:\nBlue Origin plans second launch of New Glenn mega-rocket on November 9\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nJeff Bezos\u2019 space company Blue Origin is finally ready to try a second launch of its super heavy-lift rocket New Glenn. The company announced on Wednesday that it will attempt the launch as early as Sunday, November 9, from Launch Complex 36 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nNew Glenn\u2019s first flight took place back in January, and it was mostly successful. The rocket\u2019s second stage made it into orbit, but the first stage exploded on its return to Earth before Blue Origin could attempt to land it on a drone ship in the ocean.\nEarlier this year, the company said it would try to launch New Glenn for a second time in \u201clate spring.\u201d That timeline slipped a few times, though. Blue Origin is being extra careful with the second launch in part because it will be carrying cargo on behalf of paying customers this time. The main cargo is NASA\u2019s twin ESCAPADE spacecraft, which are headed to Mars. A Viasat tech demonstrator will also be on board.\n\ntitle3:\nPinterest CEO touts open source AI: 'tremendous performance' with reduced costs\ndescription3:\nOn an earnings call on Tuesday, Pinterest CEO Bill Ready highlighted the promise of open source AI models in helping the company keep its costs down as it expands the use cases for visual AI.\nThe image pinboarding site, which often serves as consumers\u2019 first step in their shopping journey, leverages AI technology to power a variety of features, including its personalized recommendations, a multimodal search experience that combines text and images, ad targeting, and, most recently, product discovery with the launch of its AI-powered Pinterest Assistant.\nHowever, investors wanted to know what Pinterest\u2019s opportunity in agentic commerce \u2014 AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users \u2014 was given the rapidly changing AI landscape and how that could impact its bottom line and growth potential.\nThat question has become more pressing. During the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings announcement, it predicted a weaker holiday shopping season than expected, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and their negative impact on the home furnishings category. As a result, Pinterest\u2019s fourth-quarter revenue is expected to come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion, while analysts were estimating $1.34 billion, on average. The news sent the stock tumbling by more than 21% on Wednesday.\nDespite the near-term revenue concerns, Ready pointed to ways the business could maximize its use of AI and LLMs (large language models), without dramatically increasing its costs. In addition to its own proprietary models that are already accounted for in its cost structure, Ready said the company tests leading off-the-shelf models against open source options on a regular basis and found the open source models promising.\n\u201cOne of the really, really interesting things that we\u2019re seeing is that we are just getting tremendous performance from open source models specifically for Pinterest use cases on visual AI,\u201d Ready told investors. \u201cGiven current market rates and per token costs, in early testing, we\u2019re seeing orders of magnitude reduction in cost with comparable performance using fine-tuned open source models versus leading off-the-shelf proprietary models.\u201d\nHe said the company planned to move forward with many open source models for its various use cases, which would come at \u201ca fraction of the cost\u201d of the larger model providers.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cWe feel really good about the value that we\u2019re bringing to the user there, our ability to align that with monetization, and our ability to control those costs and deliver that effectively,\u201d said Ready.\nThe exec also touched on other areas where Pinterest is considering how to best use AI, including agentic shopping. Ready said that Pinterest already offers \u201cpush-button type buying\u201d via its Amazon partnership, and it will wait to see if users actually want the AI to \u201cpush the button for them.\u201d\nImage Credits:Pinterest\nIn the meantime, Ready suggested that Pinterest\u2019s biggest differentiator is that it guides the user through the shopping experience \u2014 something it hopes to improve with Pinterest Assistant, an AI companion users can talk to, asking for advice and recommendations. The assistant understands the user based on their boards, collages, saves, and how they compare to people with similar tastes, the company says.\nPinterest is also rolling out personalized boards curated with AI, which Ready said combine expert human curation and AI.\n\ntitle4:\nDiscord's Family Center update now lets parents monitor weekly purchases\ndescription4:\nDiscord has rolled out updates to its Family Center, giving guardians more insights into their teens\u2019 usage patterns, including purchases, top interactions, and time spent. The goal is to help parents monitor whether their teen is spending excessive time or money on Discord.\nThe communication platform first launched Family Center in 2023 with an activity dashboard showing which servers their teens have joined and a weekly email summary for guardians about their teen\u2019s activity. The platform is now expanding these monitoring abilities.\nGuardians can now see total purchases made by the teen in the last week, including items from Discord\u2019s Shop and Nitro subscriptions (Discord\u2019s premium membership service).\nImage Credits: Discord\nThey can also view the total time spent on voice and video calls in DMs, groups, and servers over the past week. Plus, Discord will display the top five users and servers teens interacted with in the last seven days. This comes after other social networks Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat have also implemented restrictions on who can contact teens.\nDiscord is also adding new parental controls to the app with settings that can only be altered by guardians. They can now control who can DM their teen and whether sensitive content should be filtered. Guardians can also manage data privacy controls for teens, determining how Discord uses their data, including whether to show them personalized ads.\nImage Credits: Discord\nThe company also said that when teens report content on the platform, they now have an option to notify their parents or guardians of their action. However, Discord said it won\u2019t disclose what content was reported and encourages teens to discuss this directly with their guardians instead.\n\u201cThe new features allow guardians who have linked Family Center accounts to play a more active role in creating a safer space online for teens while still respecting their privacy,\u201d Discord said in a blog post.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.
