Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

SoftBank led the financing, CNBC reported. Other participants included Microsoft, Coatue, Altimeter, and Thrive, all of which are earlier backers in the outfit.\n\u201c[This new capital] enables us to push the frontiers of AI research even further, scale our compute infrastructure, and deliver increasingly powerful tools for the 500 million people who use ChatGPT every week,\u201d OpenAI wrote in the blog post. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to be working in partnership with SoftBank Group \u2014 few companies understand how to scale transformative technology like they do.\u201d\nCNBC, citing a source familiar with the matter, says that around $18 billion of the funding will go toward OpenAI\u2019s ambitious Stargate infrastructure project, which aims to establish a network of AI data centers around the U.S.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon unveils Nova Act, an AI agent that can control a web browser\ndescription1:\nAmazon on Monday unveiled Nova Act, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform some simple actions. Alongside the new agentic AI model, Amazon is releasing the Nova Act SDK, a toolkit that allows developers to build agent prototypes with Nova Act.\nNova Act, developed by Amazon\u2019s recently opened San Francisco-based AGI lab, will also power key features of the company\u2019s upcoming Alexa+ upgrade, a generative AI-enhanced version of Amazon\u2019s popular voice assistant. The version of Nova Act available starting today is a little less polished, however. Amazon is calling it a research preview.\nDevelopers can access the Nova Act toolkit on a new website, nova.amazon.com, which also serves as a showcase for Amazon\u2019s various Nova foundation models.\nNova Act is Amazon\u2019s attempt to take on OpenAI\u2019s Operator and Anthropic\u2019s Computer Use with general-purpose AI agent technology of its own. Several leading tech companies believe AI agents that can navigate the web for users will make today\u2019s AI chatbots significantly more useful.\nAmazon may not be the first to develop this sort of agentic technology, but via Alexa+, it may have the widest reach.\nAmazon says developers building with the Nova Act SDK should be able to automate basic actions on behalf of users, such as ordering salads from Sweetgreen or making dinner reservations. With the Nova Act toolkit, developers can pull together tools that allow an AI agent to navigate web pages, fill out forms, or pick dates on a calendar.\nAmazon claims that Nova Act outperforms agents from OpenAI and Anthropic on several of the company\u2019s internal tests. For example, on ScreenSpot Web Text, which measures how an AI agent interacts with text on a screen, Nova Act scored 94%, outperforming OpenAI\u2019s CUA (which scored 88%) and Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet (90%).\nHowever, Amazon didn\u2019t benchmark Nova Act using more common agent evaluations, such as WebVoyager.\nNova Act is the first public product to emerge from Amazon\u2019s aforementioned AGI lab, an initiative co-led by former OpenAI researchers David Luan and Pieter Abbeel. Both previously founded startups of their own \u2014 Luan started Adept, while Abbeel co-founded Covariant \u2014 before Amazon hired them away last year to spearhead its AI agent efforts.\nWhile it may seem strange for an AGI lab to be building AI agents that can order salads, Luan told TechCrunch that he sees agents as a key step toward creating superintelligent AI systems. Luan defines AGI as \u201can AI system that can help you do anything a human does on a computer.\u201d\nLuan says his team designed the Nova Act SDK to reliably automate short, simple tasks, and give developers tools to precisely define when they want a human to intervene in an agentic workflow. He hopes it will allow developers to create more reliable agentic applications, albeit not necessarily fully autonomous ones.\nAmazon is releasing its first generalist AI agent in a crowded space, but it\u2019s a crucial technology that the company has a lot riding on. Early tests of Nova Act could provide a glimpse into some of the capabilities of the long-delayed Alexa+, a make-or-break moment for Amazon\u2019s AI efforts.\nA major problem with early AI agents from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic is their reliability across different domains. In TechCrunch\u2019s tests, the systems are slow, struggle to operate independently for very long, and are prone to mistakes a human wouldn\u2019t make. It won\u2019t be long until we see whether Amazon has cracked the code \u2014 or whether its agents suffer from the same flaws plaguing competitors.\n\ntitle2:\nAlphabet's AI drug discovery platform Isomorphic Labs raises $600M from Thrive\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nIsomorphic Labs, the AI drug-discovery platform that was spun out of Google\u2019s DeepMind in 2021, has raised external capital for the first time. The $600 million round was led by Thrive Capital, with participation from GV and existing investor Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, it said.\nThe funding will accelerate further development of Isomorphic\u2019s AI drug design engine and support the company\u2019s goal of bringing its discovered drugs to clinical trials.\nIsomorphic Labs was founded by DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis by leveraging DeepMind\u2019s software for AI drug discovery, including AlphaFold, an AI model that predicts the three-dimensional structures of proteins.\nLast year, Isomorphic Labs secured strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis, potentially generating up to $3 billion in milestone payments for access to its AI model.\nHassabis told the New York Times that while Isomorphic Labs didn\u2019t need the capital, the extra funding will help the division hire top research scientists.\nFor their work on AlphaFold, Hassabis and DeepMind researcher John Jumper were among the three scientists who received a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2024.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI plans to release a new 'open' AI language model in the coming months\ndescription3:\nOpenAI says that it intends to release its first \u201copen\u201d language model since GPT\u20112 \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\nThat\u2019s according to a feedback form the company published on its website Monday. The form, which OpenAI is inviting \u201cdevelopers, researchers, and [members of] the broader community\u201d to fill out, includes questions like, \u201cWhat would you like to see in an open-weight model from OpenAI?\u201d and \u201cWhat open models have you used in the past?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to collaborate with developers, researchers, and the broader community to gather inputs and make this model as useful as possible,\u201d OpenAI wrote on its website. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in joining a feedback session with the OpenAI team, please let us know [in the form] below.\u201d\nOpenAI plans to host developer events to gather feedback and, in the future, demo prototypes of the model. The first developer event will take place in San Francisco within a few weeks, followed by sessions in Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.\nOpenAI is facing increasing pressure from rivals such as Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that have adopted an \u201copen\u201d approach to launching models. In contrast to OpenAI\u2019s strategy, these \u201copen\u201d competitors make their models available to the AI community for experimentation and, in some cases, commercialization.\nIt has proven to be a wildly successful strategy for some outfits. Meta, which has invested heavily in its Llama family of open AI models, said earlier in March that Llama had racked up over 1 billion downloads. Meanwhile, DeepSeek has quickly amassed a large worldwide user base and attracted the attention of domestic investors.\nIn a recent Reddit Q&A, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he thinks OpenAI has been on the wrong side of history when it comes to open sourcing its technologies.\n\u201c[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy,\u201d Altman said. \u201cNot everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it\u2019s also not our current highest priority [\u2026] We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years.\u201d\nAltman expanded on OpenAI\u2019s open model plans in a post on X on Monday afternoon, saying that OpenAI\u2019s upcoming open model will have \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities along the lines of OpenAI\u2019s o3-mini.\n\u201c[B]efore release, we will evaluate this model according [to] our preparedness framework, like we would for any other model,\u201d Altman said. \u201c[A]nd we will do extra work given that we know this model will be modified post-release [\u2026] [W]e\u2019re excited to see what developers build and how large companies and governments use it where they prefer to run a model themselves.\u201d\nExcerpts of a forthcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey published over the weekend allege that Altman misled OpenAI executives about model safety reviews prior to his brief ouster in November 2023.\n\ntitle4:\nConstruct Capital raises $300M fund for defense and manufacturing tech\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nConstruct Capital, an early-stage venture capital firm that invests in startups applying technology to sectors like manufacturing, transportation, and defense, has closed its third fund with $300 million in capital commitments.\nThe Washington, D.C.-based firm previously raised a $225 million second fund and a $75 million capital pool for later-stage companies in 2022.\nWhile many emerging managers are struggling to raise fresh funds, Construct\u2019s capital haul underscores institutional investors\u2019 interest in backing VCs focused on the growing field of defense tech amid rising geopolitical tensions, along with the Trump administration\u2019s push to increase domestic manufacturing.\nThe firm was founded in 2020 by former NEA partner Dayna Grayson and Rachel Holt, who was previously an executive at Uber. Construct has invested in startups like Hadrian, which uses software to manufacture parts for the defense and aerospace industries, and Veho, a company specializing in last-mile e-commerce delivery from distribution centers to customers.\"\n\nResponse:",
