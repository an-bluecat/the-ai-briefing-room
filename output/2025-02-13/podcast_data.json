Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday February 14), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTikTok is back on the App Store and the Play Store in the U.S.\ndescription0:\nAfter more than 25 days, Apple and Google restored TikTok in the U.S Thrusday evening. Both companies removed the app from the App Store and the Play Store on January 18 in response to a national security law.\nOther ByteDance apps such as video editor CapCut and social app Lemon8 were also restored on these app stores. Apple, which published a rare support document detailing these removals, has deleted the support document now.\nOn January 19, TikTok started restoring services to existing users, but Apple and Google kept the app out of their stores. That meant if you had uninstalled TikTok, you wouldn\u2019t have been able get it. Earlier this month, TikTok urged users on Android to sideload the app via its website.\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order right after assuming office to give a 75 day lifeline to the app. Within these 75 days, ByteDance has to sell TikTok to an entity in the U.S. or face a ban.\nTrump said last month that he would like the U.S. to have 50% share of TikTok along with other companies through a joint venture. He also inaugrated the U.S. soverign fund that could participate in TikTok\u2019s dealmaking.\nLast month, CNBC reported that TikTok\u2019s traffic was restored almost 90% from the pre-ban time according to Cloudflare Radar data. However, rival social networks are trying to bank on this uncertaintly. Both X and Bluesky launched dedicated vertical video feeds while Meta announced a video editing app that would rival Capcut.\nAccording to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, TikTok was the second most downloaded app in the country last year with 52 million downloads.\n\ntitle1:\nHotstar and JioCinema merge into JioHotstar as Reliance tightens grip on streaming in India\ndescription1:\nHotstar and JioCinema, two widely used video streaming apps in India, have merged into JioHotstar.\nJioStar, a joint venture between Reliance-owned Viacom18 and Star India, said Friday it had integrated JioCinema\u2019s vast library of content into a revamped version of Disney\u2019s Hotstar platform.\nThe merged app, live as of early Friday local India time, will feature hundreds of thousands of hours of local content, more than 100 TV channels as well as movies and TV shows from Disney, Warner Bros, HBO, NBCUniversal and Paramount. JioHotstar aims to reach more than 500 million users in the country.\nJioHotstar, which offers content in 19 languages and produces 30,000 hours of television programming annually, has subscription plans starting at \u20b9149 ($1.71) for three months (ad-supported) and \u20b9299 ($3.45) per month for ad-free experience. The ad-free tier allows simultaneous viewing across four screens at once, whereas the cheapest ad-supported model limits that to one screen.\nThe consolidation follows Reliance\u2019s $8.5 billion merger with Walt Disney\u2019s Indian assets last year, which created a joint venture that controls about 85% of India\u2019s streaming market and half of television viewership.\nData: SensorTower, Image: UBS\n\u201cEntertainment is no longer a privilege, but a shared experience for all,\u201d said Kiran Mani, JioStar\u2019s digital chief executive. The group said existing JioCinema subscribers would transition to JioHotstar once their current subscriptions expire.\nThe merger brings India\u2019s most valuable sports rights under one platform, including cricket properties such as the Indian Premier League and International Cricket Council tournaments, alongside the soccer Premier League and FIFA World Cup.\nJioCinema\u2019s app will be phased out after existing customers\u2019 subscriptions expire. JioCinema subscribers will be able to \u201cseamlessly\u201d transition and set up their JioHotstar subscriptions, the company told TechCrunch.\nThe consolidation reflects the difficulties foreign media groups have faced in India\u2019s price-sensitive market. Netflix and Amazon Prime have also struggled to grow paid subscriptions despite heavy investment in local content.\nAmazon, which last year acquired MX Player, is aggressively expanding the new video streaming app with more than 100 original shows and movies this year. MX Player was the third most popular video streaming app in December, right behind Hotstar and JioCinema, according to Sensor Tower.\n\ntitle2:\nTim Cook teases Apple product news for February 19 \u2014 likely the iPhone SE\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nApple CEO Tim Cook took to X Thursday to tease \u201cthe newest member of the family,\u201d set to arrive February 19. The safe money is on a fourth-generation iPhone SE. The budget-minded handset had previously been tipped for a potential release a week prior, but we got new Beats headphones instead.\nIt\u2019s been three years since Apple released the last iPhone SE at $429. It\u2019s an oversight for a product that plays such an important role for the company in massive markets like China and India. This time out, Apple is likely to ditch the Touch ID home button once and for all in favor of Face ID authentication.\nThe upcoming handset is also rumored to sport the same chip that powers the iPhone 16, allowing it to run the company\u2019s generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence. The handset would arrive shortly after Alibaba confirmed that it is working with Apple to bring AI to the iPhone in China.\n\ntitle3:\nArm is launching its own chip this year with Meta as a customer\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nPublic semiconductor company Arm will start making its own chips this year after landing a high-profile enterprise customer.\nArm, which is majorly owned by SoftBank, will start making its own chips now that Meta has signed on as a customer, according to the Financial Times. The chip is expected to be a CPU for servers in large data centers and can be customized for various customers. Arm will outsource its production.\nThe first in-house Arm chip will be unveiled as early as this summer, the Financial Times also reported.\nThis is a notable change in strategy for the semiconductor company, which usually licenses its chip blueprints to companies like Apple and Nvidia. Making its own chips will turn some of its existing customers into competitors.\nTechCrunch reached out to both Meta and Arm for comment and will update the story if we hear back.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta CTO says staff should quit if they don\u2019t like Meta\u2019s new policies\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nMeta\u2019s CTO Andrew Bosworth has choice words for Meta employees frustrated with the tech giant\u2019s latest policies: They are free to quit, Business Insider reported.\nThe report cites an internal chat where an employee criticized Meta for cutting DEI programs and allegedly silencing internal dissent, among other issues.\nBosworth responded that any staffer who thinks it\u2019s OK to leak to the media because of policy disagreements \u201cshould consider working elsewhere.\u201d\nAn employee followed up that blaming leaks was not the answer, and that Meta workers felt disrespected. (Meta began layoffs this week for what it has controversially termed \u201clow performers.\u201d)\nBosworth responded that, \u201cYou should quit if you feel that way, I mean it.\u201d\nThe tense conversation reflects some degree of internal turmoil at Meta as it implements significant policy changes, from rolling back DEI efforts to loosening moderation standards.\nMeta didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
