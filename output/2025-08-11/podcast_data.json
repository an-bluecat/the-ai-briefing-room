Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The tech giant is anticipated to unveil the new Pixel 10 series, and we\u2019ll also likely see the Pixel Watch 4, new earbuds, and possibly AI features.\nBefore the event starts, the video will also be embedded here in this article. As usual, TechCrunch will provide updates as they happen.\nThe main attraction is expected to be the new Pixel 10 series, which will include the standard model, the Pixel 10 Pro, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold.\nThere are also rumors that Google will reveal the Pixel Watch 4, which could feature longer battery life and faster charging. New earbuds, such as a refreshed Pixel Buds 2a, might also be on the horizon.\nAdditionally, we may get more AI features for the Pixel 10 as Google ramps up its efforts to focus on its family of Gemini models.\n\ntitle1:\nApple's new Siri may allow users to operate apps just using voice\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nApple in 2024 showed a swanky demo of what it said would be a new, intelligent Siri that would connect with different apps to fetch all kinds of information. But this new Siri has yet to see the light of day, as the company seemingly hasn\u2019t been able to get it ready.\nHowever, Bloomberg now reports that Apple is testing a version of Siri that will be able to take actions on your behalf across various apps by following voice commands. The company plans to release a new version of App Intents, its framework that gives developers the ability to allow users access to parts of their app via different systems, like search and Shortcuts.\nBloomberg reported that if this new version of Siri and App Intents works well, a user would be able to ask Siri to search for a photo, edit it, and send it to someone; post comments on a social app; or log in to a service.\nThe company is already testing this feature with apps like Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp, the report said. The publication previously reported that Apple planned to release an overhauled version of Siri in spring 2026.\nWe want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events.
