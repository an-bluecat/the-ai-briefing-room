Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday May 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nThe US is reviewing Benchmark\u2019s investment into Chinese AI startup Manus\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nManus AI is one of the hottest AI agent startups around, recently raising $75 million at a half-billion-dollar valuation in a round led by Benchmark.\nBut two unnamed sources told Semafor that the investment is now under review by the U.S. Treasury Department over its compliance with 2023 restrictions on investing in Chinese companies.\nBenchmark\u2019s lawyers cleared the investment because Manus isn\u2019t technically developing its own AI models, but is instead a \u201cwrapper\u201d around existing ones, Semafor reported.\nThose lawyers also concluded Manus is not China-based since it\u2019s incorporated in the Cayman Islands. (That\u2019s a common structure used by Chinese companies, like Alibaba, to access foreign capital.)\nBenchmark has attracted criticism for its Manus investment from Founders Fund partner Delian Asparouhov, who posted on X \u201cwow, actions have consequences?\u201d.\nwow, actions have consequences?\nim hearing about this for the first time https://t.co/lTIcRByz5w \u2014 delian (@zebulgar) May 9, 2025\nBenchmark, Manus, and Treasury didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nEpic Games and Spotify test Apple's new App Store rules\ndescription1:\nFortnite maker Epic Games and Spotify are testing Apple\u2019s new App Store policies by submitting apps for review that would have previously never been allowed. On Friday, both companies submitted new versions of their respective apps to Apple\u2019s App Review.\nFor Epic Games, it would mean the return of Fortnite to the App Store. Apple removed the game in 2020 and terminated Epic\u2019s account after the company challenged the App Store rules by adding support for direct payments in Fortnite, ahead of filing its antitrust lawsuit against Apple.\nSpotify, meanwhile, hopes to allow its users to buy individual audiobooks directly and allow Premium subscribers to buy \u201ctop up\u201d hours for audiobook listening. (These hours can be purchased when subscribers go over the 15 free hours they receive each month.)\nThe streamer\u2019s latest update comes on the heels of Apple\u2019s approval this week of the Amazon Kindle app, which added a \u201cBuy Book\u201d button for the first time. It also follows the approval Spotify received last week, which let U.S. users access pricing information for its subscription plans inside its streaming app, among other things.\nIn time, more apps will likely join Epic Games and Spotify to take advantage of the new App Store policies.\nFor tech companies like Epic and Spotify, the App Store policy change the judge required in the lawsuit is about boosting their bottom lines, but for smaller developers, it could impact their ability to exist at all, as it permits new business models to thrive.\nThe updated App Store policies were rolled out last week after Apple lost a major legal battle in the antitrust case filed by Epic Games, when a federal judge ruled that Apple had not followed the court\u2019s orders around in-app purchases. Though Apple largely won that lawsuit, the judge directed the tech giant to be more competitive when it comes to payment processing.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nInstead of allowing developers to link out to their website to offer consumers another way to pay for things like virtual goods or subscriptions, Apple had been requiring developers to apply for that permission. If granted, developers then also had to format how the links appeared in their apps to Apple\u2019s liking, which included the use of \u201cscare screens\u201d to warn consumers of the dangers of purchases made outside Apple\u2019s walls.\nMost importantly, Apple was continuing to charge a hefty commission on those web sales of 27%, down from 30% before the changes.\nNone of that was what the judge had in mind, so it forced Apple to drop its anticompetitive barriers and allow developers to link to web purchase options without any additional hoops to jump through, and without commissions.\n\ntitle2:\nApple said to be developing new chips for smart glasses, Macs, and more\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nApple is reportedly developing new chips to drive smart glasses similar to Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban Meta as well as more powerful Macs and AI servers.\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman notes that one of the chips is inspired by the Apple Watch\u2019s low-power processors. Apple aims to put these chips into mass production with TSMC by the end of next year or 2027, according to the report.\nGlasses are a big focus. Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple CEO Tim Cook is determined to beat Meta in the glasses market, where the latter has seen success in recent years. Since 2023, Meta has sold around 2 million pairs of Ray-Ban Metas.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Apple is currently exploring non-AR glasses that use cameras to scan the surrounding environment and rely on AI to assist users. One of the processors under development will be able to control these cameras and other components without draining too much battery, per the report.\n\ntitle3:\nCoreWeave reportedly looks to raise $1.5B in debt as IPO disappoints\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nData center operator CoreWeave is reportedly seeking a $1.5 billion debt deal after a disappointing IPO.\nAccording to the Financial Times, CoreWeave is holding a roadshow this week with bankers at JPMorgan for debt options. The company\u2019s executives intend to use the meetings to gauge investor interest.\nNew Jersey-based CoreWeave listed its shares in March, initially targeting a $2.7 billion fundraise. The company was forced to slash that total to $1.5 billion following investor concern about its large debt burden and a weakening market for AI infrastructure.\nCoreWeave, which has customers including Microsoft, raised $12.9 billion of debt in the past two years to build data centers. The company had about $8 billion of total debt on its balance sheet as of December 2024, and is facing debt and interest payments of $7.5 billion by the end of 2026, the Financial Times previously reported.\nTechCrunch has contacted CoreWeave for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle I/O 2025: What to expect, including updates to Gemini and Android 16\ndescription4:\nGoogle I/O, Google\u2019s biggest developer conference of the year, is nearly upon us.\nScheduled for May 20 to 21 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, I/O will showcase product announcements from across Google\u2019s portfolio. Expect plenty of news relating to Android, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, and \u2014 of course \u2014 Google\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini.\nHere\u2019s what to expect.\nGemini and AI\nImage Credits:Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\nAI is the tech du jour, and Google, like its rivals, has been investing heavily in it.\nA shoo-in for I/O is a new addition (or several) to Google\u2019s flagship Gemini family of AI models. Leaks over the past few weeks suggest that an updated Gemini Ultra model is on the way, Gemini Ultra being Google\u2019s top-of-the-line Gemini offering.\nWith this upgraded Gemini Ultra may come a pricier Gemini subscription.\nGoogle offers a single premium tier, Gemini Advanced ($20 per month), to unlock additional capabilities in its Gemini chatbot, which is powered by the company\u2019s Gemini models. But Google may soon launch two new plans, Premium Plus and Premium Pro. It\u2019s not yet clear what benefits might be attached and how these plans might be priced relative to Gemini Advanced.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nGoogle will almost certainly talk about Astra, its wide-ranging effort to build AI apps and \u201cagents\u201d for real-time, multimodal understanding. Also probably on the agenda is Project Mariner, Google\u2019s AI \u201cagents\u201d that can navigate and take action across the web on a user\u2019s behalf. Folks on X spotted references to \u201cComputer Use\u201d in the code for Google\u2019s AI Studio developer platform, which could well pertain to Mariner.\nAndroid 16\nImage Credits:Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\nFor the first time this year, Google is hosting a separate event dedicated to Android updates: The Android Show. It\u2019ll take place on Tuesday, roughly a week ahead of I/O.\nThe latest version of Android, Android 16, will be the focus. Android 16 is expected to bring with it improved notifications and an entirely new design language, Material 3 Expressive. In a leaked blog post, Google describes Material 3 Expressive as a top-to-bottom overhaul, with greater responsiveness and \u201caction elements\u201d that pop.\nAndroid 16 is mostly a quality-of-life update, judging by reports. It\u2019ll introduce support for Auracast, which should make it easier to switch between Bluetooth devices. Also in tow are lock screen widgets and a range of new accessibility features.\nGoogle may also spotlight capabilities in the latest versions of Android XR, its mixed reality operating system, and Wear OS, the company\u2019s software for wearables.\nEverything else\nGoing by the official I/O schedule, Google will have plenty to discuss following The Android Show and I/O keynote addresses.\nThe schedule lists sessions dedicated to Chrome and Google Cloud, Google Play (the Android app store), Android development tools, and Gemma, Google\u2019s collection of \u201copen\u201d AI models.\nLast year, Google unveiled a few AI-themed surprises at I/O, including a set of models fine-tuned for education applications called LearnLM. An upgrade to Google\u2019s viral podcast-generating NotebookLM could be one such surprise. Leaked code reveals a \u201cVideo Overviews\u201d tool that presumably would create video summaries, most likely leveraging Google\u2019s Veo 2 video-generating model.\"\n\nResponse:",
