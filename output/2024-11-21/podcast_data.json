Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas.

Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

This more conversational Siri is part of Apple\u2019s attempt to catch up in AI, where competitors have released impressive features, like Google\u2019s Gemini Live, that are far more natural to talk to than Siri.\nThe new assistant reportedly will fully replace the Siri interface that users rely on today, and Apple is planning to release the feature in the spring of 2026. The feature seems like it will be similar to OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode but with all the same access to personal information and apps that Siri has today.\nUntil then, Apple is relying on third parties to power the iPhone\u2019s advanced AI features. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT will become available inside Apple Intelligence in December, and Apple has reportedly discussed similar deals with other AI providers, such as Google and Anthropic.\n\ntitle1:\nNvidia (NVDA) stock after Q3 earnings\ndescription1:\nPOLAND - 2024/11/13: In this photo illustration, the NVIDIA company logo is seen displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nNvidia shares whipsawed Thursday as investors reacted to the U.S. chipmaker's third-quarter earnings.\nShares of the tech giant were down 1.5% in late-morning trading, having initially traded higher earlier in the session. The stock had previously fallen in premarket deals.\nInvestors were reacting to Nvidia's latest quarterly results, which beat on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue came in at $35.08 billion, up 94% year on year and exceeding the $33.16 billion forecast by LSEG analysts. Earnings per share were 81 cents adjusted, also above analyst expectations.\nThe broader semiconductor space got a bump from Nvidia turning higher. AMD , one of Nvidia's closest rivals, dropped about 1%. Qualcomm was up 1%, while Intel rose 1.2%.\nNvidia has largely cornered the market for the high-powered chips driving the world's most advanced artificial intelligence models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\ntitle2:\nDOJ pushes for Google to break off Chrome browser after antitrust case\ndescription2:\nU.S. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter speaks about the antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment during a press conference as Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco look on during a press conference at the Department of Justice in Washington, U.S., May 23, 2024. REUTERS/Ken Cedeno\nThe Department of Justice is calling for Google to divest its Chrome browser, following a ruling in August that the company holds a monopoly in the search market.\nChrome, which Google launched in 2008, provides the search giant with data it then uses for targeting ads. The DOJ said in a filing Wednesday that forcing the company to get rid of Chrome would create a more equal playing field for search competitors.\n\"To remedy these harms, the [Initial Proposed Final Judgment] requires Google to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,\" the 23-page filing reads.\nAdditionally, the DOJ said that Google be prevented from entering into exclusionary agreements with third parties like Apple and Samsung. The department also said that Google be prohibited from giving its search service preference within its other products.\nThe DOJ also said that remedies should prevent Google from eliminating \"emerging competitive threats through acquisitions, minority investments, or partnerships.\" The DOJ said that the \"proposed remedies run for a period of 10 years.\" The filing also says the search company should be required to provide a technical committee with a monthly report outlining any changes to its search text ads auction.\n\"The proposed remedies are designed to end Google's unlawful practices and open up the market for rivals and new entrants to emerge,\" the filing reads.\nSearch advertising accounted for $49.4 billion in revenue in parent company Alphabet's third quarter, representing three-quarters of total ad sales in the period.\nThe DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft , which reached a settlement in 2001.\nIn addition to its call for Google to divest Chrome, the DOJ said forcing the search company to divest its Android mobile operating system would also aid in restoring competition, \"but Plaintiffs recognize that such divestiture may draw significant objections from Google or other market participants.\"\nInstead, the DOJ suggested that the other remedies should be enough to \"blunt Google's ability to use its control of the Android ecosystem to favor its general search services,\" and if they \"ultimately fail to achieve the high standards for meaningful relief in these critical markets, the Court could require return to\" the Android divestiture suggestion.\nIn a blog post response Thursday, Google Global Affairs President and Legal Chief Kent Walker called the DOJ's proposal an \"overbroad proposal\" that would impact privacy and AI investments at a critical time.\nWalker added that it \"goes miles beyond the Court's decision\" and \"would break a range of Google products \u2014 even beyond Search.\"\n\"DOJ's approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses \u2014 and jeopardize America's global economic and technological leadership at precisely the moment it's needed most,\" Kent said.\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google holds a monopoly in the search market. The ruling came after the government in 2020 filed its landmark case, alleging that Google controlled the general search market by creating strong barriers to entry and a feedback loop that sustained its dominance. The court found that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which outlaws monopolies.\nLast month, the DOJ indicated it was considering a breakup of Google businesses, including potentially breaking up its Chrome, Play or Android divisions.\nAdditionally, the DOJ suggested limiting or prohibiting default agreements and \"other revenue-sharing arrangements related to search and search-related products.\" That would include Google's search arrangements with Apple on the iPhone and Samsung on its mobiles devices, deals that cost the company billions of dollars a year in payouts.\nGoogle has said it will appeal the monopoly ruling, which would draw out any final remedy decisions.\nHowever, the most likely outcome, according to some legal experts, is that the court will ask Google to do away with certain exclusive agreements, like its deal with Apple. While a breakup is an unlikely outcome, the experts said, the court may ask Google to make it easier for users to access other search engines.\n\ntitle3:\nTexas AG opens investigation into advertising group that Elon Musk sued for 'boycotting' X\ndescription3:\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Thursday he is opening an investigation into the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) to determine whether the trade group\u2019s members conspired to boycott \u201ccertain social media platforms.\u201d While the press release doesn\u2019t name social media platforms by name, one of them is likely Elon Musk\u2019s X, which filed an antitrust lawsuit against the WFA in August and alleged that advertisers orchestrated a \u201csystematic illegal boycott\u201d of the platform.\n\u201cTrade organizations and companies cannot collude to block advertising revenue from entities they wish to undermine,\u201d said Paxton in the press release. \u201cToday\u2019s document request is part of an ongoing investigation to hold WFA and its members accountable for any attempt to rig the system to harm organizations they might disagree with.\u201d\nSeveral of the WFA\u2019s members \u2013 which includes global brands such as IBM, The Coca-Cola Company, and CVS Health \u2013 have stopped or significantly reduced the amount they spend for advertising on X since Elon Musk\u2019s takeover of the company. There was an especially large exodus of advertisers, including Apple and Disney, from X in November 2023 following reports from the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Media Matters that suggested Elon Musk\u2019s X had failed to moderate its platform and remove illegal or hateful content. At the time, a White House spokesperson condemned Elon Musk for one of his personal posts, which it called \u201cantisemitic and racist.\u201d\nSince then, X has sued many advertisers and ad groups, claiming these global brands were not reducing their ad spend based on individual decisions, but instead collectively conspiring to withhold billions of dollars in revenue from X. Now it appears Texas\u2019 AG is bringing an investigation of his own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a major problem,\u201d said Musk in response to Paxton\u2019s Thursday post on X about the advertiser investigation.\nMuch like X\u2019s lawsuit, Paxton zeroes in on a since-discontinued, not-for-profit organization within the WFA, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media or GARM. This was a US-based group founded in 2019 that included some of the country\u2019s largest advertisers. It created frameworks and definitions for companies to understand hate speech, brand safety, and misinformation.\nThe AG\u2019s investigations asks for documents and information from GARM that could reveal whether it told brands to boycott certain social media platforms that violated its brand safety standards.\nWhen announcing her platform\u2019s lawsuit against advertisers, X CEO Linda Yaccarino cited a July report from the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee looking into GARM\u2019s practices. That report found:\nThrough GARM, large corporations, advertising agencies, and industry associations participated in boycotts and other coordinated action to demonetize platforms, podcasts, news outlets, and other content deemed disfavored by GARM and its members. This collusion can have the effect of eliminating a variety of content and viewpoints available to consumers.\nGARM closed its doors in August, shortly after X sued, noting that it did not have the resources or finances to continue operating.\nIn the months leading up to this investigation, some advertisers have actually resumed ad spending on X, though at much lower rates than before. Comcast, IBM, Disney and other major brands reportedly returned to Musk\u2019s platform this year. Furthermore, X announced in October that it reached an agreement with Unilever to resume its ad spending, and that the social media platform would drop its claims against Unilever, which X previously named as one of the companies that participated in the alleged boycott.\nX and the World Federation of Advertisers did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nBluesky CEO Jay Graber says X rival is 'billionaire proof'\ndescription4:\nBluesky has surged in popularity since the presidential election earlier this month, suddenly becoming a competitor to Elon Musk's X and Meta's Threads. But CEO Jay Graber has some cautionary words for potential acquirers: Bluesky is \"billionaire proof.\"\nIn an interview on Thursday with CNBC's \"Money Movers,\" Graber said Bluesky's open design is intended to give users the option of leaving the service with all of their followers, which could thwart potential acquisition efforts.\n\"The billionaire proof is in the way everything is designed, and so if someone bought or if the Bluesky company went down, everything is open source,\" Graber said. \"What happened to Twitter couldn't happen to us in the same ways, because you would always have the option to immediately move without having to start over.\"\nGraber was referring to the way millions of users left Twitter, now X, after Musk purchased the company in 2022. Bluesky now has over 21 million users, still dwarfed by X and Threads, which Facebook's parent debuted in July 2023.\nX and Meta didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThreads has roughly 275 million monthly users, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in October. Although Musk said in May that X has 600 million monthly users, market intelligence firm Sensor Tower estimates 318 million monthly users as of October.\nBluesky was created in 2019 as an internal Twitter project during Jack Dorsey's second stint as CEO, and became an independent public benefit corporation in 2022. In May of this year, Dorsey said he is no longer a member of Bluesky's board.\n\"In 2019, Jack had a vision for something better for social media, and so that's why he chose me to build this, and we're really thankful for him for setting this up, and we've continued to carry this out,\" said Graber, who previously founded Happening, a social network focused on events. \"We're building an open-source social network that anyone can take into their own hands and build on, and it's something that is radically different from anything that's been done in social media before. Nobody's been this open, this transparent and put this much control in the users hands.\"\nPart of Bluesky's business plan involves offering subscriptions that would let users access special features, Graber noted. She also said that Bluesky will add more services for third-party coders as part of the startup's \"developer ecosystem.\"\nGraber said Bluesky has ruled out the possibility of letting advertisers send algorithmically recommended ads to users.\n\"There's a lot on the road map, and I'll tell you what we're not going to do for monetization,\" Graber said. \"We're not going to build an algorithm that just shoves ads at you, locking users in. That's not our model.\"\nBluesky has previously experienced major growth spurts. In September, it added 2 million users following X's suspension in Brazil over content moderation policy violations in the country and related legal matters.\nIn October, Bluesky announced that it raised $15 million in a funding round led by Blockchain Capital. The company has raised a total of $36 million, according to Pitchbook.\"\n\nResponse:",
