Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday January 15), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nElon Musk is being sued by the feds over the way he bought Twitter\ndescription0:\nElon Musk\u2019s acquisition of Twitter has resulted in a federal lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging that he broke securities laws with a late disclosure, and saved $150 million in the process.\nBefore Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion, before he tried to back out of that deal, before he was forced to go through with it, and before he changed its name to X, he started by acquiring a substantial stake in the company but didn\u2019t reveal that fact until weeks later.\nThe only problem, as the SEC pointed out then, is that by the time he disclosed that stake, it was outside the agency\u2019s required 10-day window. They claim that he should\u2019ve filed his paperwork by March 24th, 2022, instead of when he actually did, on April 4th (and then again on April 5th). During that period, they say he purchased more than $500 million in shares of the company.\nHowever, with only a few days left before the Trump administration takes over and installs a new head of the SEC (along with Elon Musk reportedly snagging an office in the White House complex), it\u2019s unclear how far the lawsuit will go.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta execs obsessed over beating OpenAI's GPT-4 internally, court filings reveal\ndescription1:\nExecutives and researchers leading Meta\u2019s AI efforts obsessed over beating OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model while developing Llama 3, according to internal messages unsealed by a court on Tuesday in one of the company\u2019s ongoing AI copyright cases, Kadrey v. Meta.\n\u201cHonestly\u2026 Our goal needs to be GPT-4,\u201d said Meta\u2019s VP of Generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, in an October 2023 message to Meta researcher Hugo Touvron. \u201cWe have 64k GPUs coming! We need to learn how to build frontier and win this race.\u201d\nThough Meta releases open AI models, the company\u2019s AI leaders were far more focused on beating competitors that don\u2019t typically release their model\u2019s weights, like Anthropic and OpenAI, and instead gate them behind an API. Meta\u2019s execs and researchers held up Anthropic\u2019s Claude and OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 as a gold standard to work toward.\nThe French AI startup Mistral, one of the biggest open competitors to Meta, was mentioned several times in the internal messages, but the tone was dismissive.\n\u201cMistral is peanuts for us,\u201d Al-Dahle said in a message. \u201cWe should be able to do better,\u201d he said later.\nTech companies are racing to upstage each other with cutting-edge AI models these days, but these court filings reveal just how competitive Meta\u2019s AI leaders truly were \u2014 and seemingly still are. At several points in the message exchanges, Meta\u2019s AI leads talked about how they were \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in obtaining the right data to train Llama; at one point, an exec even said that \u201cLlama 3 is literally all I care about,\u201d in a message to coworkers.\nProsecutors in this case allege that Meta\u2019s executives occasionally cut corners in their mad race to shipping AI models, training on copyrighted books in the process.\nTouvron noted in a message that the mix of datasets used for Llama 2 \u201cwas bad,\u201d and talked about how Meta could use a better mix of data sources to improve Llama 3. Touvron and Al-Dahle then talked about clearing the path to use the LibGen dataset, which contains copyrighted works from Cengage Learning, Macmillan Learning, McGraw Hill, and Pearson Education.\n\u201cDo we have the right datasets in there[?]\u201d said Al-Dahle. \u201cIs there anything you wanted to use but couldn\u2019t for some stupid reason?\u201d\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has previously said he\u2019s trying to close the performance gap between Llama\u2019s AI models and closed models from OpenAI, Google, and others. The internal messages reveal the intense pressure within the company to do so.\n\u201cThis year, Llama 3 is competitive with the most advanced models and leading in some areas,\u201d said Zuckerberg in a letter from July 2024. \u201cStarting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry.\u201d\nWhen Meta ultimately released Llama 3 in April 2024, the open AI model was competitive with leading closed models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, and outperformed open options from Mistral. However, the data Meta used to train its models \u2014 data Zuckerberg reportedly gave the green light to use, despite its copyright status \u2014 are facing scrutiny in several ongoing lawsuits.\n\ntitle2:\nBiden opens federal land for AI data centers, sets developer rules\ndescription2:\nU.S. President Joe Biden delivers a speech at the State Department in Washington, U.S. Jan. 13, 2025.\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order Thursday aimed at speeding domestic construction of artificial intelligence infrastructure and shoring up the national security risk involved in the technology.\nThe move empowers the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of Energy to lease federal sites for gigawatt-scale AI data centers.\n\"AI is poised to have large effects across our economy, including in health care, transportation, education, and beyond, and it is too important to be offshored,\" the White House said in a release.\nThe order also issued guidelines for AI developers using the sites to not only build, operate and maintain the leased centers at full cost, but also to deliver clean energy resources to match their capacity needs to prevent increases in electricity costs.\nCompanies leasing the federal lands will also be required to purchase an \"appropriate share\" of U.S.-manufactured semiconductors and to pay workers \"prevailing wages\", according to the release. After the agencies select the sites, developers can submit lease proposals.\nGlobal electricity consumption from data centers, AI and the cryptocurrency sector is expected to double between 2022 and 2026, according to a report from the International Energy Agency.\n\ntitle3:\nHackers are exploiting a new Fortinet firewall bug to breach company networks\ndescription3:\nSecurity researchers say malicious hackers have been exploiting a newly discovered vulnerability in Fortinet firewalls to break into corporate and enterprise networks.\nIn an advisory published Tuesday, security product maker Fortinet confirmed that a critical-rated vulnerability in its FortiGate firewalls, tracked as CVE-2024-55591, is \u201cbeing exploited in the wild.\u201d\nFortinet made patches available, but security researchers have warned that hackers have been mass-exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day \u2014 meaning before Fortinet was aware of the vulnerability and made fixes available \u2014 since December.\nThis is the latest example of hackers exploiting a vulnerability in a popular enterprise security product designed to protect corporate networks from intruders. News of the Fortinet bug lands days after it was revealed that attackers are exploiting a separate zero-day flaw in Ivanti VPN servers that allows access to customers\u2019 networks.\nCybersecurity company Arctic Wolf said in a blog post last week that its researchers observed a recent \u201cmass exploitation\u201d campaign affecting Fortinet FortiGate firewall devices with management interfaces exposed to the public internet.\nStefan Hostetler, lead threat intelligence researcher at Arctic Wolf, confirmed to TechCrunch that this observed exploitation is linked to the newly confirmed CVE-2024-55591 vulnerability in Fortinet firewalls.\nHostetler told TechCrunch that Arctic Wolf had \u201cobserved a cluster of intrusions affecting Fortinet devices in the tens,\u201d but notes that this only represents a \u201climited sample compared to the total actual number of devices that were likely affected.\u201d\n\u201cThe evidence points to an effort to exploit a large number of devices within a narrow time frame,\u201d added Hostetler.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Fortinet spokesperson Tiffany Curci declined to say how many Fortinet customers were compromised as a result of this hacking campaign, but said that the company was \u201cproactively communicating with customers.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also unclear who is behind the attacks on Fortinet firewalls, but cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont writes on Mastodon that the vulnerability is \u201cunder exploitation by a ransomware operator.\u201d\nHostetler said that ransomware attacks exploiting the bug are \u201cnot off the table,\u201d noting that in previous research, Arctic Fox \u201cobserved affiliates of ransomware groups such as Akira and Fog using some of the same network providers to establish VPN connectivity.\u201d\nIn a brief statement on Tuesday, U.S. cybersecurity CISA urged Fortinet customers to update any affected devices.\nIn September, Fortinet disclosed a breach involving customer data after an attacker accessed \u201ca limited number of files\u201d stored on a third-party shared cloud drive belonging to the organization.\n\ntitle4:\nNintendo Switch 2 could be announced this week: The rumors (and facts) so far\ndescription4:\nWith CES 2025 finally in the rearview, it\u2019s time to move on to the next round of big hardware announcements. Rumors have emerged over the last few weeks, pointing to an imminent announcement for the next generation of Nintendo\u2019s wildly successful hybrid Switch console.\nIn particular, word from industry stalwart Eurogamer (among others) pegs a January 16 announcement \u2014 that is to say, Thursday. If indeed the big reveal is coming this week, it points to a more incremental announcement. The company will likely dole out information one Nintendo Direct at a time rather than one, big keynote with specs, availability, and launch titles.\nWe do know for certain that the company had its sights set on a Q1 announcement for the Switch 2 \u2014 specifically, before the end of March 2025. One other key bit confirmed by Nintendo is the device\u2019s backward compatibility with its predecessor. That\u2019s good news for the 150 million or so who purchased the first Switch.\nThe biggest question at the moment is how large of an upgrade we\u2019re ultimately talking about here. Nintendo\u2019s console names have largely pointed to big departures for every subsequent generation. With few exceptions \u2014 like the ill-fated Wii U \u2014 things have been far less straightforward than, say, Sony\u2019s PlayStation.\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that the Switch 2 will be an evolution of the existing product, rather than a meaningful departure. After all, Nintendo spent some time in the wilderness prior to the Switch\u2019s March 2017 launch. The convertible form factor and some truly excellent titles were precisely what the company needed to reestablish itself in a dramatically different gaming landscape after the Wii U\u2019s stumbles.\nThere\u2019s no doubt the new console will best the original specs, but it\u2019s also important to temper expectations, given Nintendo\u2019s history. The days of going toe-to-toe with competitors on elements like GPU are decades in the company\u2019s past.\nOther rumors are just that: magnetic Joy-Cons and a jump in screen size to eight inches up from six on the classic Switch and seven on the Switch OLED, which arrived toward the end of 2021. Between that console upgrade and the portable-only, budget-minded model that Nintendo introduced with the Switch Lite in 2019, there have been upgrades along the way.\n[Nintendo Switch 2 not pictured]\"\n\nResponse:",
