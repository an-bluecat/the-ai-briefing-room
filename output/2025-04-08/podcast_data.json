Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday April 9), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nInside the EV startup secretly backed by Jeff Bezos\ndescription0:\nJeff Bezos is funding a secretive EV startup based in Michigan called Slate Auto that could start production as soon as next year, according to multiple sources and documents that link the billionaire\u2019s family office to the startup.\nSlate, which took root in another Bezos-connected company called Re:Build Manufacturing, has been operating quietly since its founding in 2022. The company has hired hundreds of employees while in stealth \u2014 many of whom come from Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, and Harley-Davidson.\nIt also attracted the backing of several other wealthy individuals, including Mark Walter, the controlling owner of the LA Dodgers and CEO of Guggenheim Partners, and Thomas Tull, who is a lead investor of Re:Build Manufacturing, according to documents TechCrunch obtained from Delaware\u2019s Division of Corporations.\nSlate Auto is tackling a big goal: an affordable two-seat electric pickup truck for around $25,000, according to two sources who were granted anonymity to speak about the company\u2019s internal discussions. Leaders inside the company have mentioned the Ford Model T or Volkswagen Beetle as a North Star for the project, according to the people.\nIt has amassed a sizable war chest in service of that goal.\nThe company quietly raised at least $111 million in a Series A round in 2023, according to a public filing. Bezos was involved, and Melinda Lewison, the person who manages his family office, is listed as a director on paperwork Slate has filed with states and the federal government. The filing shows 16 people invested in that round; it is unclear how much Bezos put into the company.\nSlate has told employees that it closed a Series B late last year, according to multiple sources familiar with its funding. It has not yet filed any paperwork for the round with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Delaware paperwork shows it authorized nearly 500 million preferred shares for the Series B priced at $2.37 per share. (Slate also authorized more than 400 million shares of common stock in the past year, though the filings did not state a price.)\nThe Delaware paperwork also lists Walter and Tull as new board members, suggesting the two invested in Slate\u2019s Series B round. The two recently formed a $40 billion holding company to make investments. Walter and Tull could not be reached for comment.\nSlate hopes to get its vehicle into production as soon as late 2026 at a manufacturing facility somewhere near Indianapolis, Indiana, according to job listings, state lobbying records, and a 2024 interview with executive chairman Rodney Copes. It is not immediately clear if Slate purchased an existing factory or plans to build one from scratch.\nThe clandestine project is taking shape at a challenging time for electric vehicles.\nOnce-explosive growth of the sector has cooled off, and multiple startups dedicated to building EVs have filed for bankruptcy. Those that have survived, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, have done so by burning through billions of dollars.\nSlate plans to supplement the small margins of its low-cost truck by building out a line of accessories and apparel that owners can use to customize their vehicles and their looks, according to the sources and various job listings. It has filled its executive ranks with former Harley-Davidson and Stellantis employees \u2014 two companies that have historically leaned on these kinds of ancillary businesses (the former with apparel and the latter with MoPar parts and accessories).\nSlate is headquartered in Troy, Michigan, and the startup has also shown off a proof of concept vehicle to investors at a non-descript design studio it\u2019s leasing in Long Beach, California, according to the sources. It has targeted high-net-worth individuals and kept a tight lid on its fundraising process.\nThe company and multiple people connected to Slate, Re:Build Manufacturing, and Bezos\u2019 family office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story. TechCrunch also reached out to Bezos directly and did not receive a response.\nDeep Amazon ties\nSlate is shot through with Amazon DNA.\nAlongside Bezos\u2019 family office, Slate\u2019s Series A included funding from former Amazon executive Diego Piacentini, according to his firm\u2019s website.\nSlate was initially created as a project called Re:Car in early 2022 within Re:Build Manufacturing, a domestic manufacturing incubator of sorts co-founded by former Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke and his MIT Leaders for Global Operations classmate Miles Arnone. Several long-time Amazon executives, including Wei Gao, who was a top VP and technical adviser to Bezos, are now at Re:Build Manufacturing.\nSlate\u2019s digital, e-commerce, and automotive experience leads are Amazon expats. Even Slate\u2019s original name includes the \u201cre:\u201d prefix Amazon uses for events, like the re:MARS robotics and AI conference, or the annual re:Invent gathering for AWS.\nBezos has invested in more than 30 companies through his family office over the years, touching the worlds of AI (Perplexity), robotics (Figure), defense (Anduril), and even mobility (Uber). Slate is one of the most direct investments he\u2019s made in the world of electric vehicles outside of the relationship his company Amazon has with Rivian.\nHis investment has largely been just that, though. People familiar with the company\u2019s inner workings told TechCrunch that he has not been seen around Slate\u2019s Michigan or Los Angeles offices.\nBucking the trend\nNearly all of the EV startups that have come (and gone) over the last decade have tried in some way to replicate the approach Tesla took. They\u2019ve designed their first vehicles to be high-end offerings so they can sell fewer cars for more money. Eventually, after growing brand awareness, these companies move into higher-volume, cheaper EVs that generate smaller margins.\nSlate is inverting this by going after what it hopes will be a buyer\u2019s \u201cfirst car,\u201d according to the people who spoke with TechCrunch.\nThe idea is to sell the truck at a price point of around $25,000, and have owners personalize or upgrade the car over time as they can afford it.\nIn late March, Slate filed for a trademark on the phrase: \u201cWE BUILT IT. YOU MAKE IT.\u201d There is a long list of goods and services it could cover, including everything from switches and speakers to USB ports and pet harnesses.\nOther details can be gleaned from the many job listings Slate has posted over the last two years.\nOne posted in 2024 hinted the company will dub the customer customization process \u201cSlate University.\u201d The listing was originally titled \u201cUniversity Lead\u201d and was renamed to \u201cHead of Customer Education Repair & Maintenance\u201d before the startup stopped accepting applications.\n\u201cWe seek an enthusiastic, experienced Leader of Slate University to build and lead our game-changing approach to open-source content for customers to enhance their ownership experience,\u201d the listing reads. \u201cAs the Lead, you will drive the strategy and ecosystem development for the educational content and delivery for Slate shoppers, customers, technicians, and partners.\u201d\nAnother job listing for \u201cLead Product Manager, Accessories\u201d explains that Slate is \u201cexploring opportunities in the electric mobility space and are building complimentary accessories, apparel, and merchandise capability.\u201d It also mentions the person would be overseeing the development of \u201cutility parts\u201d and \u201clifestyle and personalization accessories.\u201d\nThis approach \u2014 subsidizing a low-margin manufacturing business with a higher-margin accessories play \u2014 is one that has been used by automakers, including Harley-Davidson with its apparel division and Jeep-maker Stellantis with its Mopar parts and service division.\nUnsurprisingly, Slate is already pulling experience from both of those companies as it builds out its team.\nThe startup\u2019s executive chairman is Rodney Copes, who spent 20 years at Harley-Davidson. Chief Financial Officer Ryan Green spent nearly a decade on the finance side of the motorcycle manufacturer. (Copes and Green also had stints at Rivian.) Slate\u2019s heads of service, commercial, accessories product management, and growth marketing also worked at Harley-Davidson.\nSlate apparently plans to source its high-voltage battery pack, electric motors, and other related tech from outside suppliers, according to one job listing. The startup is \u201cchallenging the status quo of vehicle design,\u201d according to another listing for a design/release engineer for windshield wipers. A posting for an accountant role says the person hired would have to help implement the \u201crequired systems to be a public company.\u201d\nAccording to another role, any prospective head of PR and communications: \u201cMust love cars! You\u2019ll be thinking about cars all day every day, and it\u2019s the most fun when you love cars.\u201d\nNo founder to be found\nAnother way Slate appears to be bucking the trend of other EV startups is that it does not have a founder serving as CEO.\nArnone is considered to be Slate\u2019s founder, according to the sources who spoke to TechCrunch, but his day-to-day job is serving as CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing.\nInstead, Slate\u2019s CEO is Christine Barman, a longtime Chrysler veteran. She initially got into the automotive industry through an internship at General Motors after attending Purdue University, according to a 2023 interview.\nShe then spent more than 20 years at Chrysler overseeing the vehicle line program for the Chrysler 300, Dodge Charger, and Jeep Cherokee, according to her LinkedIn profile. Barman eventually became the vice president of electrical and electronics for Fiat Chrysler, where she led the automaker\u2019s integration of Android Automotive and spent time working on the company\u2019s collaboration with Waymo, before leaving the company in 2017.\nBarman has not spent the last decade posting online like many of her EV startup CEO peers. She instead has mostly been advising companies on emerging tech and teaching engineering before getting involved in 2022 with what at the time was a nascent EV project within Re:Build Manufacturing.\nBarman did not respond to a request for comment.\nKirsten Korosec contributed to this report.\n\ntitle1:\nInstagram is beefing up its search to compete with TikTok\ndescription1:\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri says the company is looking to improve the app\u2019s search functionality, admitting this is an area where Instagram could do more to compete. The remarks, made on a recent episode of the \u201cBuild Your Tribe\u201d podcast, come at a time when younger Gen Z users often turn to social apps like TikTok for answers, instead of using traditional search engines.\nInstagram is in that mix, too, of course, but it knows its position could be stronger.\n\u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 starting to invest more in search on Instagram because there\u2019s so much amazing content,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd quite frankly, what we call content search \u2014 as opposed to searching for an account, actually searching for some type of content \u2014 it\u2019s not very good on Instagram.\u201d\nThe exec noted that part of the problem was that the team working on Instagram search has been small, but Meta recently \u201cstrengthened\u201d that team with the goal of rolling out more improvements on this front over the months and years ahead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long road, but I do think that could also be a really good one for people who are looking for things. You can imagine, whatever you use Instagram for, it\u2019d be great to be able to find \u2018that\u2019 more easily,\u201d Mosseri said. \u201cBut also for creators \u2026 it should allow content to resurface so that you don\u2019t get all the value in those first 24 or 48 hours.\u201d\nThe way that Gen Z and younger users search for content is something that\u2019s been in flux for some time.\nGoogle identified how the problem was affecting its own future as a search provider when, back in 2022, a Google exec suggested that social apps like TikTok and Instagram were eating into its core business, including Search and Maps.\nLast fall, TikTok began to more directly compete with Google\u2019s ad business by allowing its advertisers to target its search results page.\nVarious market research studies have also confirmed this shift in how younger people use the internet and web search, to different degrees. In one U.S. study, for example, Instagram topped Google Search and other rivals as Gen Z\u2019s preferred search engine.\nBut this is still a close race and not one that Instagram has necessarily won.\nA Bernstein Research study cited by Fortune in April 2024 found that 45% of Gen Zers are more likely to use social media for searches, and a 2024 HerCampus study cited in eMarketer found that 51% of Gen Zers favor TikTok over Google Search, primarily for its short-form video format.\nMosseri\u2019s comments indicate that Meta knows the next frontier where Instagram needs to compete is as a search engine, not just a social network for keeping up with friends.\nOnly a \u201cvery small percentage\u201d of average users (non-creators) post to Instagram\u2019s Feed on a given day, he also said, adding that this part of Instagram is becoming \u201cmuch more of a public domain.\u201d Stories and DMs (direct messages), meanwhile, are where users interact with their friends.\nAnother area where Instagram aims to compete with TikTok on search is the recommended searches that appear at the top of the comments section.\nOn TikTok, the suggested search is extracted from what people are talking about in the comments. That\u2019s something Instagram wants to improve, too.\n\u201cSometimes, where the real interesting context is not \u2026 in the video that someone uploaded, but in the context around it \u2014 which is almost always in the comments. And so what we\u2019re trying to do is surface that more easily, and then you can go and find out more,\u201d he said.\nHe noted that the version of Instagram\u2019s app that looks more toward the comments to enhance search suggestions is coming out \u201csoon.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nApple might import more iPhones from India to sidestep China tariffs\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nApple is considering importing more iPhones from India to sidestep the 54% additional tariffs on goods imported from China that U.S. president Donald Trump announced last week, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing anonymous sources.\nThe company sees this as a short-term measure while it seeks to negotiate with the Trump administration to get an exemption from the tariffs, as it doesn\u2019t yet want to revamp its supply chain built around China, the report said.\nCompared to the new 54% tariffs on Chinese-made goods, the U.S. has proposed a 26% tariffs on goods imported from India. If the tariffs aren\u2019t brought down and Apple continues to import iPhones from China, an iPhone 16 Pro that cost $550 to import before tariffs could cost an additional $300 now.\nApple was on track to make 25 million iPhones in India this year, with 10 million units for the local market, the Wall Street Journal cited Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan as saying. He said that if Apple decided to import all 25 million iPhones to the U.S., it would satisfy about 50% of the demand in the U.S. market.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle fixes two Android zero-day bugs actively exploited by hackers\ndescription3:\nOn Monday, Google released an update for Android that fixes two zero-day flaws that \u201cmay be under limited, targeted exploitation,\u201d as the company put it. That means Google is aware that hackers have been and may still be using the bugs to compromise Android devices in real-world scenarios.\nOne of the two now-fixed zero-days, tracked as CVE-2024-53197, was identified by Amnesty International in collaboration with Beno\u00eet Sevens of Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, the tech giant\u2019s security team that tracks government-backed cyberattacks.\nIn February, Amnesty said it had found that Cellebrite, a company that sells devices to law enforcement for unlocking and forensically analyzing phones, was taking advantage of a chain of three zero-day vulnerabilities to hack into Android phones.\nContact Us Do you have more information about Android zero-days? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you have more information about Android zero-days? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email . You also can contact TechCrunch via SecureDrop\nIn this case, Amnesty found the vulnerabilities, including the one patched on Monday, being used against a Serbian student activist by local authorities armed with Cellebrite.\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of information, however, on the second vulnerability, CVE-2024-53150, patched on Monday, other than the fact that its discovery was also credited to Google\u2019s Sevens and that the flaw was found in the kernel, the core of an operating system.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAmnesty spokesperson Hajira Maryam said the non-profit did not have anything to share at this point.\nThe tech giant said in its advisory that \u201cthe most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in the System component that could lead to remote escalation of privilege with no additional execution privileges needed,\u201d and that, \u201cuser interaction is not needed for exploitation.\u201d\nGoogle said that it would push source code patches for the two fixed zero-days within 48 hours of the advisory, while also noting that Android partners are \u201cnotified of all issues at least a month before publication.\u201d\nGiven Android\u2019s open source nature, every phone manufacturer now has to push patches out to their own users.\nThis story was updated to include Amnesty\u2019s response.\n\ntitle4:\nA 25-year-old police drone founder just raised $75M led by Index\ndescription4:\nIf you ever call 911 from an area that\u2019s hard to get to, you might hear the buzz of a drone well before a police cruiser pulls up. And there\u2019s a good chance that it will be one made by Brinc Drones, a Seattle-based startup founded by 25-year-old Blake Resnick, who dropped out of college to run the company.\nBrinc, which was founded in 2017 and counts OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as a seed-stage investor, just announced today that it has raised $75 million in new funding led by Index Ventures.\nThis brings the startup\u2019s total funding to $157.2 million. While Brinc isn\u2019t disclosing its exact valuation, Resnick told TechCrunch it\u2019s an \u201cup-round\u201d compared to its most recent round, a $55 million Series B in 2022. Brinc was last valued at $300 million in 2023, Bloomberg reported.\nBrinc sells a variety of drone systems to police and public safety agencies. It\u2019s part of a broader trend of U.S. drone startups manufacturing domestically due to increasing restrictions against Chinese companies that dominate the commercial drone industry. (Resnick briefly interned at DJI, by far the biggest Chinese player, a few years before founding Brinc.)\nWith this funding, Brinc is launching a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d with Motorola Solutions, which also invested in the round. Motorola Solutions is a giant in the U.S. security industry whose software powers many 911 call centers. The partnership will integrate Brinc drones directly into those centers, allowing operators to dispatch drones for certain emergency calls if they\u2019re cleared by an existing Motorola AI system.\nBrinc is, however, in an increasingly competitive field with other U.S. startups like Flock Safety and Skydio. Each also offers drones for police, and have multibillion-dollar valuations. Flock stood at $7.5 billion in its latest round last month while Skydio was valued at $2.2 billion in 2023.\nWhen it comes to the competition, Resnick tells TechCrunch that there\u2019s plenty of room for growth in a market that is otherwise dominated by Chinese players. Beyond the Motorola partnership, he says Brinc offers its share of unique features, like the ability to break windows or deliver emergency medical devices.\"\n\nResponse:",
