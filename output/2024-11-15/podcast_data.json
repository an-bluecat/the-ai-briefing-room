Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday November 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nElon Musk's xAI raising up to $6 billion to purchase 100,000 Nvidia chips for Memphis data center\ndescription0:\nElon Musk listens as US President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a House Republicans Conference meeting at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill on November 13, 2024 in Washington, DC.\nElon Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI is raising up to $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation, according to CNBC's David Faber.\nSources told Faber that the funding, which should close early next week, is a combination of $5 billion expected from sovereign funds in the Middle East and $1 billion from other investors, some of whom may want to re-up their investments.\nThe money will be used to acquire 100,000 Nvidia chips, per sources familiar with the situation. Tesla 's Full Self Driving is expected to rely on the new Memphis supercomputer.\nMusk's AI startup, which he announced in July 2023, seeks to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website. Last November, xAI released a chatbot called Grok, which the company said was modeled after \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" The chatbot debuted with two months of training and had real-time knowledge of the internet, the company claimed at the time.\nWith Grok, xAI aims to directly compete with companies including ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which Musk helped start before a conflict with co-founder Sam Altman led him to depart the project in 2018. It will also be vying with Google's Bard technology and Anthropic's Claude chatbot.\nNow that Donald Trump is president-elect, Musk is beginning to actively work with the new administration on its approach to AI and tech more broadly, as part of Trump's inner circle in recent weeks.\nTrump plans to repeal President Joe Biden's executive order on AI, according to his campaign platform, stating that it \"hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology\" and that \"in its place, Republicans support AI Development rooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\"\n\ntitle1:\nSuper Micro faces deadline to keep Nasdaq listing after 85% plunge\ndescription1:\nCharles Liang, chief executive officer of Super Micro Computer Inc., during the Computex conference in Taipei, Taiwan, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024. The trade show runs through June 7.\nSuper Micro Computer could be headed down a path to getting kicked off the Nasdaq as soon as Monday.\nThat's the potential fate for the server company if it fails to file a viable plan for becoming compliant with Nasdaq regulations. Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and has yet to replace its accounting firm. Many investors were expecting clarity from Super Micro when the company reported preliminary quarterly results last week. But they didn't get it.\nThe primary component of that plan is how and when Super Micro will file its 2024 year-end report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and why it was late. That report is something many expected would be filed alongside the company's June fourth-quarter earnings but was not.\nThe Nasdaq delisting process represents a crossroads for Super Micro, which has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom due to its longstanding relationship with Nvidia and surging demand for the chipmaker's graphics processing units.\nThe one-time AI darling is reeling after a stretch of bad news. After Super Micro failed to file its annual report over the summer, activist short seller Hindenburg Research targeted the company in August, alleging accounting fraud and export control issues. The company's auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October, and Super Micro said last week that it was still trying to find a new one.\nThe stock is getting hammered. After the shares soared more than 14-fold from the end of 2022 to their peak in March of this year, they've since plummeted by 85%. Super Micro's stock is now equal to where it was trading in May 2022, after falling another 11% on Thursday.\nGetting delisted from the Nasdaq could be next if Super Micro doesn't file a compliance plan by the Monday deadline or if the exchange rejects the company's submission. Super Micro could also get an extension from the Nasdaq, giving it months to come into compliance. The company said Thursday that it would provide a plan to the Nasdaq in time.\nA spokesperson told CNBC the company \"intends to take all necessary steps to achieve compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements as soon as possible.\"\nWhile the delisting issue mainly affects the stock, it could also hurt Super Micro's reputation and standing with its customers, who may prefer to simply avoid the drama and buy AI servers from rivals such as Dell or HPE .\n\"Given that Super Micro's accounting concerns have become more acute since Super Micro's quarter ended, its weakness could ultimately benefit Dell more in the coming quarter,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wrote in a note this week.\nA representative for the Nasdaq said the exchange doesn't comment on the delisting process for individual companies, but the rules suggest the process could take about a year before a final decision.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI's tumultuous early years revealed in emails from Musk, Altman, and others\ndescription2:\nA lawsuit by the world\u2019s wealthiest man against one of the fastest growing companies of all time is necessarily interesting stuff. But while the allegations are yet to be proven, the case has already exposed a batch of emails between Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others during OpenAI\u2019s early days. Here are a few of the more interesting snippets we found while perusing their correspondence.\nBear in mind that these emails were exposed as part of an attempt to prove OpenAI is somehow breaking antitrust law (a frankly implausible allegation). Musk is also revealing to some extent his feeling of betrayal when OpenAI abandoned its original vision of being a nonprofit with the Tesla CEO as its leader.\nThey do not tell the whole story, but they are still interesting in their own right.\nPerhaps the most interesting single email is former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever explaining the team\u2019s qualms with Musk as leader of the company:\nThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI [artificial general intelligence]. You stated that you don\u2019t want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you\u2019ve shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you. As an example, you said that you needed to be CEO of the new company so that everyone will know that you are the one who is in charge, even though you also stated that you hate being CEO and would much rather not be CEO. Thus, we are concerned that as the company makes genuine progress towards AGI, you will choose to retain your absolute control of the company despite current intent to the contrary. The goal of OpenAI is to make the future good and to avoid an AGI dictatorship. You are concerned that Demis [Hassabis, at Google-owned DeepMind] could create an AGI dictatorship. So do we. So it is a bad idea to create a structure where you could become a dictator if you chose to, especially given that we can create some other structure that avoids this possibility.\nThis isn\u2019t entirely about corporate control; Sutskever is worried about an existential AI threat being created with only one person in the way.\nSutskever also voices worries about Altman, using words much like the board would later use while accusing him of not being \u201cconsistently candid\u201d:\nWe haven\u2019t been able to fully trust your judgements throughout this process, because we don\u2019t understand your cost function. We don\u2019t understand why the CEO title is so important to you. Your stated reasons have changed, and it\u2019s hard to really understand what\u2019s driving it. Is AGI truly your primary motivation? How does it connect to your political goals?\nGiven the way things have played out and Altman\u2019s steering of the company toward a much more traditional enterprise SaaS position, it seems like his goal was more business than philosophy.\nOne interesting tidbit is that as early as 2017, OpenAI was seriously considering buying chipmaker Cerebras, or somehow merging with it, potentially using Tesla\u2019s resources somehow. As Sutskever puts it:\nIn the event we decide to buy Cerebras, my strong sense is that it\u2019ll be done through Tesla.\nThey ended up not going through with it, though the reason why is not in these emails.\nThis, by the way, was back when Musk was angling to have OpenAI be just one of his many properties, and the leaders were open to that possibility. As OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy wrote:\nThe most promising option I can think of, as I mentioned earlier, would be for OpenAI to attach to Tesla as its cash cow. [\u2026] If we do this really well, the transportation industry is large enough that we could increase Tesla\u2019s market cap to high O(~100K), and use that revenue to fund the AI work at the appropriate scale.\nAgain, this didn\u2019t happen for a lot of reasons that seem clear in hindsight. Tesla\u2019s market cap did in fact increase, but the self-driving side of things \u2014 which Karpathy aimed to accelerate later when he took a job at Tesla \u2014 proved harder than expected, and has not yet contributed meaningfully to Tesla\u2019s revenue.\nAs far as making money, Microsoft was in the mix from as early as 2016, offering OpenAI $60 million worth of compute on Azure in exchange for, among other things, the companies \u201cevangelizing\u201d one another. No one seemed into this kind of corporate back-scratching, and Musk wrote that it made him \u201cnauseous.\u201d\nThey ultimately ended up paying far more but with no obligation on either side. \u201cWould be worth way more than $50M not to seem like Microsoft\u2019s marketing bitch,\u201d wrote Musk.\nLastly, a minor nugget mentioned by board member Shivon Zilis (who would later become mother to three of Musk\u2019s children): Valve founder Gabe Newell was, in addition to being a donator to the project in the early days, on Altman and Greg Brockman\u2019s \u201cinformal advisory board.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what role he had or has in the day-to-day there. I\u2019ve asked Newell for comment.\n\ntitle3:\nFormer TuSimple co-founder urges courts to block asset transfer to China\ndescription3:\nXiaodi Hou, the co-founder and former CEO of self-driving trucking startup TuSimple, has urged a California district court to issue a temporary restraining order to stop the company from transferring its remaining U.S. assets to China, according to a recent court filing.\nHou, who plans to apply for a temporary restraining order in December during the next scheduled court hearing, is hoping to keep TuSimple from moving tens of millions of dollars in cash to China. As of September, TuSimple had roughly $450 million in capital. Hou is also requesting expedited discovery of evidence to aid his requests for the motion.\nHou\u2019s declaration to the court, filed on Monday, is the latest escalation in the battle between TuSimple and some of its shareholders, over the company\u2019s attempts to use investor capital to fund a new AI-generated animation and video game business in China.\nThis is the first time Hou \u2014 who was ousted from his role as CEO in 2022 \u2014 has publicly accused TuSimple and its leaders of funneling assets toward animation and gaming businesses owned by or with direct ties to Mo Chen, TuSimple co-founder and chairman of the board, under the guise of a business pivot. Hou also argued the company violated SEC regulations by neither informing nor gaining approval from shareholders before changing its business direction or transferring funds to China.\nHou now heads a new autonomous trucking startup in Texas\nTuSimple, once valued at $8.5 billion after its 2021 IPO, faced setbacks that led to its U.S. shutdown and delisting in January 2024. The company\u2019s stated goal was to commercialize its AV technology in China. But as the year progressed, TuSimple slashed its workforce, ceased self-driving operations, and began hiring staff to handle jobs related to AI gaming and animation.\nShareholders sent a letter to the board in August after learning TuSimple was putting resources toward AI gaming and animation. The board responded a couple weeks later by publicly announcing the new business unit.\nHou this week urged the court to issue a temporary restraining order after noticing a filing by TuSimple China that signaled the company was about to transfer money (or already had) out of the United States. Two TuSimple China subsidiaries last week registered an increase in assets collectively worth $150 million, according to Hou\u2019s declaration and information from public filings.\n\u201cThese filings show a suspicious increase in registered assets between these two subsidiaries in one day as a precursor to large amount of cash transfer from U.S. to China,\u201d reads the declaration. \u201cThe most likely scenario is that these filings in China were the preparatory steps before TuSimple U.S. transfers money to those subsidiaries in China.\u201d\nHou added that such large cash transfers are \u201cbeyond normal course of business\u201d and comparable to \u201cTuSimple China\u2019s heyday of operation when it was operating a large autonomous truck fleet in Shanghai\u201d and had around 700 employees on its payroll. As of September, TuSimple China had around 200 employees.\nThe window of opportunity for shareholders like Hou to get what they want \u2014 which is for TuSimple to liquidate so they can recuperate some of their losses \u2014 is narrowing.\nTuSimple is in a gray area when it comes to enforcement from the Securities and Exchange Commission. While TuSimple delisted earlier this year, the company is still registered with the SEC and thus subject to U.S. scrutiny. Once the money goes to China, shareholders in the U.S. will have no recourse to claw back funds from their original investment.\nTechCrunch has reached out to the SEC to learn if the agency is investigating TuSimple in relation to shareholder complaints.\nTuSimple did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nNSO Group admits cutting off 10 customers because they abused its Pegasus spyware, say unsealed court documents\ndescription4:\nOn Thursday, WhatsApp scored a legal victory by convincing a U.S. federal judge to publicly release three court documents that include new revelations about the inner workings of Pegasus, the spyware made by Israeli surveillance tech maker NSO Group.\nThe newly unsealed documents include information coming from depositions of NSO employees during the legal proceedings, internal company documents, as well as \u2014 ironically \u2014 WhatsApp messages exchanged between NSO employees, which WhatsApp obtained by sending subpoenas to NSO.\nThe documents also reveal that NSO disconnected 10 government customers in recent years from accessing the Pegasus spyware, citing abuse of its service.\nThis release of new revelations is the latest development in the lawsuit that WhatsApp filed in 2019, accusing NSO of violating the anti-hacking law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and breaching WhatsApp\u2019s terms of service, by accessing WhatsApp servers and targeting individual users with spyware sent over the chat app. The accusations are based on a series of cyberattacks against WhatsApp users, including journalists, dissidents, and human rights advocates.\n\u201cThe evidence unveiled shows exactly how NSO\u2019s operations violated U.S. law and launched their cyber-attacks against journalists, human rights activists and civil society,\u201d WhatsApp spokesperson Zade Alsawah said in a statement sent to TechCrunch. \u201cWe are going to continue working to hold NSO accountable and protect our users.\u201d\n\u2018Tens of thousands\u2019 of potential targets\nAccording to the court documents, seen by TechCrunch, NSO had developed a suite of hacking tools to be used against targets using WhatsApp, capable of accessing private data on the target\u2019s phone. The hacking suite was called \u201cHummingbird,\u201d and two of the suite\u2019s exploits were dubbed \u201cEden\u201d and \u201cHeaven.\u201d\nThis suite cost NSO\u2019s government customers \u2014 namely police departments and intelligence agencies \u2014 up to $6.8 million for a one-year license, and netted NSO \u201cat least $31 million in revenue in 2019, according to one of the court documents.\nThanks to these hacking tools, NSO installed Pegasus on \u201cbetween hundreds and tens of thousands\u201d of target devices, according to a deposition by NSO\u2019s head of research and development Tamir Gazneli.\nUntil now, it wasn\u2019t clear who was actually sending the malicious WhatsApp messages to target individuals with spyware. For years, NSO has claimed to have no knowledge of customers\u2019 operations, and not be involved in carrying out the targeted cyberattacks. The newly released court documents cast doubt on some of NSO\u2019s claims.\nWhatsApp argued in one of the court documents that, \u201cNSO\u2019s customers\u2019 role is minimal,\u201d given that the government customers only needed to input the phone number of the target\u2019s device and, citing an NSO employee, \u201cpress Install, and Pegasus will install the agent on the device remotely without any engagement.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words, the customer simply places an order for a target device\u2019s data, and NSO controls every aspect of the data retrieval and delivery process through its design of Pegasus,\u201d WhatsApp argued.\nThe court filings cited an NSO employee as saying it \u201cwas our decision whether to trigger [the exploit] using WhatsApp messages or not,\u201d referring to one of the exploits the company offered its customers.\nWhen reached for comment, NSO spokesperson Gil Lainer said in a statement to TechCrunch: \u201cNSO stands behind its previous statements in which we repeatedly detailed that the system is operated solely by our clients and that neither NSO nor its employees have access to the intelligence gathered by the system.\u201d\n\u201cWe are confident that these claims, like many others in the past, will be proven wrong in court, and we look forward to the opportunity to do so,\u201d said NSO\u2019s Lainer.\nNSO\u2019s three exploits targeted WhatsApp users\nOne technique that NSO used to allow its customers to target WhatsApp users, described in one document, was to set up something the company called a \u201cWhatsApp Installation Server,\u201d or WIS, which WhatsApp calls a \u201cfake client.\u201d This was essentially a modified version of the WhatsApp app that NSO developed and used to send messages \u2014 including their malicious exploits \u2014 to regular WhatsApp users. NSO admitted setting up real WhatsApp accounts for its customers, per one of the court documents.\nWhatsApp was able to defeat both NSO\u2019s \u201cEden\u201d and \u201cHeaven\u201d exploits with patches and security updates, according to an internal NSO communication.\n\u201cEden/Heaven/Hummingbird R.I.P. announcement,\u201d read a message sent to NSO employees.\nThe court documents show that NSO\u2019s Heaven exploit was active before 2018, and was designed to direct target WhatsApp devices into communicating with a malicious WhatsApp relay server controlled by NSO.\nAfter WhatsApp patched its systems against NSO\u2019s Heaven exploit, NSO developed a new exploit called \u201cEden,\u201d which an NSO employee quoted by the court documents said, \u201cneed[ed] to go through WhatsApp relay servers,\u201d which the Heaven exploit had sought to avoid. It was the use of the Eden exploit that led to WhatsApp filing its lawsuit against NSO, according to a deposition by another NSO employee.\nA third exploit developed by NSO, revealed in the documents, was called \u201cErised,\u201d a so-called \u201czero-click\u201d exploit that could compromise a victim\u2019s phone without any interaction from the victim. WhatsApp blocked the use of NSO\u2019s Erised exploit in May 2020, several months after WhatsApp had filed its lawsuit.\nCustomers cut-off\nAnother interesting detail that surfaced this week is the admission by one of the NSO employees deposed in the course of the lawsuit that Pegasus was used against Dubai\u2019s Princess Haya, a case that was reported by the The Guardian and The Washington Post in 2021, and later by The New Yorker in 2023.\nThe same NSO employee said the spyware maker \u201cdisconnected\u201d access to Pegasus for 10 customers, citing abuse of the spyware.\nAt this point in the legal case, WhatsApp is asking the judge to issue a summary judgment in the case, and is awaiting a decision.\nMeanwhile, the details that have come out from the lawsuit this week could help other people who have sued NSO in other countries, according to Natalia Krapiva, the tech legal counsel at Access Now, a nonprofit that has investigated some cases of abuse carried out with NSO\u2019s spyware.\n\u201cWhatsApp\u2019s sticking with their legal action finally reaps some benefits,\u201d Krapiva told TechCrunch. \u201cWhile it is true that NSO has not been sharing much information (especially things like Pegasus codes, list of customers, etc.), the information that they did share is already quite useful for this case but also for legal cases against NSO around the world.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the fact that NSO hides information also cuts both ways because it also makes it very difficult for them to present a solid defense,\u201d said Krapiva.\"\n\nResponse:",
