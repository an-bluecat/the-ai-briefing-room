Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

(OpenAI has not yet returned TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment, but to put that into perspective, that\u2019s bigger than Monaco.)\nThe UAE project, developed in partnership with G42 \u2014 an Abu Dhabi-based tech conglomerate \u2014 is part of OpenAI\u2019s ambitious Stargate project, a joint venture announced in January that could see OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle build massive data centers around the globe stocked with powerful computer chips to support AI development.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s first Stargate campus in the U.S. \u2014 already under development in Abilene, Texas \u2014 is expected to reach 1.2 gigawatts, this Middle Eastern counterpart would more than quadruple that capacity.\nThe project is emerging amid broader AI ties between the U.S. and UAE that have been years in the making, and have made some lawmakers nervous.\nOpenAI\u2019s relationship with the UAE dates back to a 2023 partnership with G42 aimed at driving AI adoption in the Middle East. During a talk earlier that same year in Abu Dhabi, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised the UAE, saying it \u201chas been talking about AI since before it was cool.\u201d\nAs with much of the AI world, these relationships are\u2026 complicated. Founded in 2018, G42 is chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE\u2019s national security advisor and younger brother of the country\u2019s ruler. Its embrace by OpenAI raised concerns in late 2023 among U.S. officials, who feared that G42 could enable China\u2019s government to gain access to advanced U.S. technology.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Because of that, of course, we have no need anymore for any physical China presence.\u201d\nSoon after, Microsoft \u2014 a major shareholder in OpenAI with its own broader interests in the region \u2014 announced a $1.5 billion investment in G42, and its president, Brad Smith, joined G42\u2019s board of directors.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle I/O 2025: What to expect, including updates to Gemini and Android 16\ndescription1:\nGoogle I/O, Google\u2019s biggest developer conference of the year, is nearly upon us.\nScheduled for May 20 to 21 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, I/O will showcase product announcements from across Google\u2019s portfolio. Expect plenty of news relating to Android, Chrome, Google Search, YouTube, and \u2014 of course \u2014 Google\u2019s AI-powered chatbot, Gemini.\nEarlier this week, Google hosted a separate event dedicated to Android updates: The Android Show. The company announced new ways to find lost Android phones and other items, additional device-level features for its Advanced Protection program, security tools to protect against scams and theft, and a new design language called Material 3 Expressive.\nHere\u2019s what else you can expect.\nGemini and AI\nImage Credits:Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket / Getty Images\nAI is the tech du jour, and Google, like its rivals, has been investing heavily in it.\nA shoo-in for I/O is a new addition (or several) to Google\u2019s flagship Gemini family of AI models. Leaks over the past few weeks suggest that an updated Gemini Ultra model is on the way, Gemini Ultra being Google\u2019s top-of-the-line Gemini offering.\nWith this upgraded Gemini Ultra may come a pricier Gemini subscription.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nGoogle offers a single premium tier, Gemini Advanced ($20 per month), to unlock additional capabilities in its Gemini chatbot, which is powered by the company\u2019s Gemini models. But Google may soon launch two new plans, Premium Plus and Premium Pro. It\u2019s not yet clear what benefits might be attached and how these plans might be priced relative to Gemini Advanced.\nGoogle will almost certainly talk about Astra, its wide-ranging effort to build AI apps and \u201cagents\u201d for real-time, multimodal understanding. Also probably on the agenda is Project Mariner, Google\u2019s AI \u201cagents\u201d that can navigate and take action across the web on a user\u2019s behalf. Folks on X spotted references to \u201cComputer Use\u201d in the code for Google\u2019s AI Studio developer platform, which could well pertain to Mariner.\nEverything else\nGoing by the official I/O schedule, Google will have plenty to discuss following The Android Show and I/O keynote addresses.\nThe schedule lists sessions dedicated to Chrome and Google Cloud, Google Play (the Android app store), Android development tools, and Gemma, Google\u2019s collection of \u201copen\u201d AI models.\nLast year, Google unveiled a few AI-themed surprises at I/O, including a set of models fine-tuned for education applications called LearnLM. An upgrade to Google\u2019s viral podcast-generating NotebookLM could be one such surprise. Leaked code reveals a \u201cVideo Overviews\u201d tool that presumably would create video summaries, most likely leveraging Google\u2019s Veo 2 video-generating model.\nUpdated: 3:19 p.m. Pacific: Added a list of new Android features announced during The Android Show.\n\ntitle2:\nHow Silicon Valley's influence in Washington benefits the tech elite\ndescription2:\nElon Musk isn\u2019t the only tech billionaire with power over the federal agencies that regulate his businesses. Since Donald Trump took office, more than three dozen employees, allies, and investors of Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have taken roles at federal agencies, helping direct billions in contracts to their companies.\nCompanies owned, founded, or invested in by Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey have collected more than a dozen federal contracts totaling about $6 billion since Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. And they\u2019re actively pursuing billions more.\nThose appointments, which are in departments that oversee, regulate, and award business to the four men\u2019s companies, raise a number of red flags. They could violate conflict-of-interest laws or government ethics regulations, both of which prohibit federal employees from using public office for private gain.\nAnd while it\u2019s not unusual to install trusted allies in government roles, Musk\u2019s network has moved in at an unprecedented rate and scale. TechCrunch has previously reported on all of the people in Musk\u2019s universe who have joined him at DOGE, where he has shuttered federal agencies and slashed workforces in departments that regulate his businesses. At least 19 others with Silicon Valley connections, be they founders or investors, have also joined DOGE.\n\u201cThe second Trump administration is actually the first in recent years to not impose any sort of additional ethics safeguards on high-level appointees,\u201d Daniel Weiner, director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Elections and Government Program, told TechCrunch. He noted that Trump fired the director of the Office of Government Ethics and 17 inspectors general who served as watchdogs for fraud and abuse, immediately after taking office.\n\u201cIt certainly does potentially increase the risk that you have people working on matters that do impact, at least indirectly, their bottom lines,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cBut this is a long-term issue in our government that\u2019s not unique to this administration.\u201d\nInnovation versus accountability\nPeter Thiel speaks during the Bitcoin 2022 Conference. Image Credits:Marco Bello / Getty Images\nSome may argue that it makes sense for employees and associates of Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey to join government agencies. Their insiders are talented individuals who are behind the cutting-edge technology the government genuinely needs, and they understand how to innovate quickly and compete globally.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nMore serious questions arise when favoritism threatens to undermine competition, when policy is created or destroyed to protect market dominance, or when regulations that would serve the public good are waylaid to promote business interests.\nFor instance, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently retreated from pursuing rules that would restrict data brokers, despite growing privacy concerns \u2014 a shift that stands to benefit companies involved in AI, surveillance, and data analytics. Another example is DOGE\u2019s firing of staffers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration who investigate autonomous vehicle safety, including several probes into Tesla.\n\u201cOne of the defining structural challenges the government of the United States has right now is that we have a system in which the very wealthiest interests have so much power to shape our elections and then turn around and shape government policy,\u201d Weiner said.\nAnother Silicon Valley appointee, Mike Kratsios \u2014 a former Thiel employee \u2014 is now leading technology policy for the U.S. government. In an April speech, he spoke about throwing away bad regulations that \u201cweigh down our innovators,\u201d particularly those who are innovating in AI.\n\u201cMany people in Silicon Valley tend to think that whatever worked in Silicon Valley is also going to work for administering the United States government,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cAnd as we\u2019re seeing now, the danger is a lot of people are going to get hurt because of the assumptions they make.\u201d\n\u201cThe fact that you had a successful startup after five others failed doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you know how to run the Social Security Administration,\u201d he continued.\nA network inside and a payoff outside\nMarc Andreessen, co-founder and general partner of Andreessen Horowitz. Image Credits:David Paul Morris/Bloomberg / Getty Images\nAll of the businesses between Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey are related. Musk\u2019s SpaceX was backed by Thiel\u2019s Founders Fund and Andreessen\u2019s a16z (which also invested in X and xAI). Both of those VCs also backed Anduril, Luckey\u2019s defense startup.\nThe overlapping network of founders, funders, and insiders extends into several federal agencies. And in many cases, those agencies are steering billions in federal contracts back to those companies.\nThe Journal found that across Washington, people from Musk\u2019s network, including Tesla, X, and SpaceX, are in more than a dozen agencies, from the executive office of the president and Office of Personnel Management all the way down to the Department of Transportation and the Department of Energy.\nSpaceX employees are also in agencies that could provide the company new business. For example, the Journal reports that SpaceX senior engineer Theodore Malaska got an ethics waiver in February that lets him take a temporary job at the Federal Aviation Administration while still working at the rocket company. The FAA hasn\u2019t given any contracts to SpaceX yet, but Malaska said on X the agency has used Starlink to upgrade a weather-observing system in Alaska.\nSpaceX is also the main commercial provider that transports crew and cargo for NASA. Despite national security concerns \u2014 like the company\u2019s secret backdoor for Chinese investment and Musk\u2019s reported drug use \u2014 SpaceX in April won $5.9 billion of a $13.7 billion multi-year contract from the U.S. Space Force to launch Pentagon missions. The DOD, which is currently a Starlink customer, also plans to buy SpaceX\u2019s Starshield satellites, a militarized version of the internet satellites.\nEmployees at Thiel-backed firms have found themselves in roles in the State Department, the Office of Management and Budget, Health and Human Services, and Social Security, per The Wall Street Journal. Thiel\u2019s Palantir has already been awarded nearly $376 million since 2020 from the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2024, the company was also awarded at least $1.2 billion in Department of Defense contracts in 2024 and is in the running for another $100 million deal.\nAnduril, Palantir, and SpaceX recently submitted a multibillion-dollar proposal for Trump\u2019s \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile-defense program, which would also add to Anduril\u2019s existing contracts with the U.S. Army. Recently, Anduril and Microsoft took over a 2021 contract worth up to $22 billion to develop AR headsets, per the Journal.\nAn Anduril executive, Michael Obadal, has been nominated to a top role at the Department of Defense. In his ethics disclosure, he stated that he would retain his Anduril stock if appointed.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Anduril, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Palantir, and SpaceX for comment.\n\u201cThis sort of concentration of private wealth and political power is ultimately very risky for our economy,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cBecause instead of the government making decisions that are intended to foster competition, foster economic growth, you run the real risk that government decisions are going to instead be structured around protecting particular companies and particular industries from full economic competition.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nAI startup Cohere acquires Ottogrid, a platform for conducting market research\ndescription3:\nAI startup Cohere has acquired Ottogrid, a Vancouver-based platform that develops enterprise tools for automating certain kinds of high-level market research.\nSully Omar, one of the founders of Ottogrid, announced the deal Friday in a post on X.

According to The Information, Cohere fell well short of revenue projections the company prepared in early 2023, missing its target for last year by 85%.\nThe company told Reuters on Thursday that its annualized revenue recently reached $100 million, following a strategic shift with a focus on private AI deployments for customers in sectors like healthcare, government, and finance.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

It rebranded in October 2024 with a major platform redesign that introduced a number of new integrations, tools, and APIs.\nToday, Ottogrid offers a \u201cnative table interface\u201d with AI-powered document analysis capabilities. Customers can use it to extract data from a website and save it directly to a spreadsheet, for example, or automatically enrich sales lead lists.\nOttogrid managed to raise $2 million in venture capital from investors, including GV (Google Ventures), Untapped Capital, Replit CEO Amjad Masad, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, Cohere co-founders Ivan Zhang and Aidan Gomez, and others prior to its exit, according to Crunchbase.\nAs part of Cohere, Omar says that Ottogrid will focus primarily on North, Cohere\u2019s recently launched ChatGPT-style application designed to assist knowledge workers with tasks such as summarizing documents.\nUpdated 2:03 p.m. Pacific: In a statement, Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez said: \u201cI\u2019m super excited to bring the Ottogrid team aboard and incorporate Ottogrid\u2019s product directly into North. We\u2019re bringing enterprises a new way to tackle research with smart tables, helping make employees\u2019 day-to-day work more enjoyable and productive.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nAI video startup Moonvalley lands $53M, according to filing\ndescription4:\nRoughly a month after Moonvalley, a Los Angeles-based startup developing AI tools for video creation, said it secured $43 million in new funding, the company has raised more, according to a filing with the SEC.\nThe filing, submitted Thursday, reveals that Moonvalley actually landed (so far) around $53 million total from a group of 14 unnamed investors.\nThe filing indicates that this is an additional $10 million in cash, rather than a whole new round. It brings the company\u2019s total raised to about $124 million, estimates PitchBook, following on the heels of Moonvalley\u2019s $70 million seed round last November. Moonvalley declined to comment.\nThe wide availability of tools to build video generators has led to such an explosion of providers that the space is becoming saturated. Startups such as Runway, Lightricks, Genmo, Pika, Higgsfield, Kling, and Luma, as well as tech giants like OpenAI, Alibaba, and Google, are releasing models at a fast clip. In many cases, little distinguishes one model from another.\nMoonvalley\u2019s Marey model, built in collaboration with a new AI animation studio called Asteria, offers customization options like fine-grained camera and motion controls and can generate \u201cHD\u201d clips up to 30 seconds long. Moonvalley claims it\u2019s also lower risk than some other video-generation models from a legal perspective.\nBut where Moonvalley is attempting to differentiate itself \u2014 hence the high VC interest \u2014 is on the data it\u2019s using to train its models, as well as the safeguards in its video creation tools.\nMany generative-video startups train models on public data, some of which is invariably copyrighted. These companies argue that fair-use doctrine shields the practice, but that hasn\u2019t stopped rights holders from lodging complaints and filing cease and desists.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nMoonvalley says it\u2019s working with partners to handle licensing arrangements and package videos into datasets that the company then purchases. The approach is similar to Bria\u2019s and Adobe\u2019s, the latter of which procures content for training from creators through its proprietary Adobe Stock platform.\nMoonvalley is also crafting an interface for its model. The company\u2019s software, which it hasn\u2019t previewed publicly yet, has storyboarding and \u201cgranular\u201d clip adjustment tools, Moonvalley\u2019s co-founders revealed in recent interviews. Marey can generate videos from not only text prompts but also from sketches, photos, and other video clips, claims Moonvalley.\nNaeem Talukdar, who previously led product growth at Zapier, founded Moonvalley with former DeepMind scientists Mateusz Malinowski and Mik Binkowski. John Thomas joined as Moonvalley\u2019s COO \u2014 he and Talukdar had founded another startup, Draft, several years ago. Moonvalley also counts Asteria head Bryn Mooser as a co-founder.\nMany artists and creators are understandably wary of video generators, as they threaten to upend the film and television industry. A 2024 study commissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimates that more than 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI by 2026.\nMoonvalley intends to allow creators to request their content be removed from its models, let customers delete their data at any time, and offer an indemnity policy to protect its users from copyright challenges.\nUnlike some \u201cunfiltered\u201d video models that readily insert a person\u2019s likeness into clips, Moonvalley is also committing to building guardrails around its tools.
