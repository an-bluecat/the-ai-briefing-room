Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nThe price of bitcoin is tracking for one of its best months of the year after former President Donald Trump's election victory catapulted the flagship cryptocurrency to new records consistently throughout the month. Bitcoin is on pace to post a 38% gain for November, according to Coin Metrics, which would make the month its best since February, when it gained 45% following the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs. That was also ahead of its first new record of the year since November 2021.\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin climbs to best month since February\nOn an intraday basis, bitcoin was last higher by more than 2% at $97,081.81. Earlier, it traded as high as $98,722.00. Coinbase fell 4.75%, while bitcoin proxies MicroStrategy and Mara Holdings gained 0.67% and 1.86%, respectively. Investors in November were pricing in Trump's second presidency. During his re-election campaign this year, he pitched himself to Americans as the candidate who would bring the crypto industry out of a dark period defined for many by the absence of clear digital assets regulation and the regulation-by-enforcement approach the Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Gary Gensler, has taken toward crypto businesses. Trump's victory sent bitcoin rallying to as high as just a couple hundred dollars shy of the highly anticipated $100,000 milestone. While another Trump term is expected to add another layer of legitimacy to the young crypto industry, it also serves as a macro catalyst, implying larger budget deficits, potentially more inflation and changes to the international role of the dollar \u2014 all things that would have a positive impact on the price of bitcoin. After the election, bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock's popular IBIT fund, registered strong inflows \u2014 including their largest day of inflows ever at one point \u2014 initially offsetting sell pressure from long-term holders who took profits at new highs. In the same period, options on bitcoin ETFs began trading, ushering in a new way to trade and speculate on the price of bitcoin.\nBulls expect bitcoin's price to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024 and potentially double by the end of 2025. While the outcome of the U.S. election boosted the price in the short term, many investors agree its impact as a bitcoin catalyst will stay behind in 2024. The coin was already largely derisked from a regulatory perspective, there's little uncertainty about how it trades or its role as digital gold, and investors are relying on its fundamentals to keep taking the price higher. Specifically, between the reduction in bitcoin's supply after this year's April halving and the growing demand for bitcoin by institutions, as well as by states and countries as a treasury reserve asset, the price is expected to soar. Bitcoin's cycle peaks usually take at least a year after the halving to come.\n\ntitle1:\nIntel finalizes $7.9 billion CHIPS Act grant\ndescription1:\nChipmaker Intel and the CHIPS and Science Act office finalized a $7.86 billion grant, the government announced Tuesday, as the Biden administration moves to dole out funds before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration.\nThat $8 billion will go toward Intel's factory-building efforts. The topline number is lower than the initially announced $8.5 billion grant, a haircut that senior administration officials said was because Intel's $3 billion contract with the Department of Defense came from CHIPS Act funds.\nThat deal was announced in September, a rare bright spot in the company's struggling efforts to grow its fab business.\n\"Thanks to the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris, our CHIPS award is enabling Intel to drive one of the most significant semiconductor manufacturing expansions in U.S. history,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a release.\n\"Intel is deeply committed to advancing these shared priorities as we further expand our U.S. operations over the next several years,\" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in the release.\nCNBC earlier reported that the two sides were close to finalizing the grant.\nThe U.S. awarded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. a $6.6 billion grant earlier this month, raising investor expectations that cash funding for Intel would come soon. Intel has benefited from CHIPS tax breaks but had not yet received cash awards, something which Gelsinger has expressed dissatisfaction with.\n\"We're frustrated that hasn't moved faster,\" Gelsinger told CNBC in October, referring to the CHIPS grants. \"They've been too bureaucratic in that process. We're anxious to see those finished.\"\nIntel's struggles have intensified since the grant was initially announced. The New York Times, citing four people familiar with the matter, reported Sunday that the government had decided to decrease the grant by roughly $500 million due to uncertainties about Intel's ability to execute on its investment commitment, and because of Intel's shifting technology road map and customer demand. Senior administration officials said the reduced award did not have anything to do with issues at Intel.\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had previously said he might look to repeal the bipartisan legislation, but he then walked back those comments. The Biden administration and grant awardees have touted the legislation as a job-creating machine.\nIntel's struggles have increased significantly this year. The company posted a nearly $17 billion loss last quarter and has been dialing back Gelsinger's ambitious plans worldwide.\nIntel announced earlier this year it would trim 15,000 jobs via layoffs and voluntary buyouts. It has made moves to make its foundry business more easily separable from its legacy business, and has been working with advisors on activist defense and a broader strategic review, people familiar with the matter previously said. Intel is also seeking to raise cash via a minority stake in the Altera business, CNBC previously reported, and has been sounding out interested acquirers for weeks.\nCNBC's Megan Cassella contributed to this report.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta plans to build a $10B subsea cable spanning the world, sources say\ndescription2:\nMeta, the parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is the second-biggest driver of internet usage globally. Its properties \u2014 and their billions of users \u2014 account for 10% of all fixed and 22% of all mobile traffic. Meta\u2019s investments into artificial intelligence stand to boost that usage even further. So to make sure it will have reliable infrastructure to support that business, Meta is taking the pipes into its own hands.\nTechCrunch has confirmed with sources close to the company that Meta plans to build a new, major, fibre-optic subsea cable extending around the world \u2014 a 40,000+ kilometer project that could total more than $10 billion of investment. Critically, Meta will be the sole owner and user of this subsea cable \u2014 a first for the company and thus representing a milestone for its infrastructure efforts.\nSunil Tagare, a subsea cable expert (and pioneer in the space, as founder of Flag Telecom), who was the first to report Meta\u2019s plans back in October, told TechCrunch that the plan is to start with a budget of $2 billion but as the project builds out that figure is likely to go up to more than $10 billion as the project extends into years of work.\nSources close to Meta confirmed the project but said it is still in its early stages. Plans have been laid out, but physical assets have not, and they declined to discuss budget. The expectation is that Meta will talk more publicly about it in early 2025, when it will confirm plans for the cable, including intended route, capacity, and some of the reasoning behind building it.\nIt would be years before it is fully operational, were the strategy to be followed through, given that the limited number of companies, like SubCom, that are capable of building out the infrastructure already have large customers, like Google, reserving its services.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real tight supply on cable ships,\u201d said Ranulf Scarborough, a submarine cable industry analyst. \u201cThey\u2019re expensive at the minute and booked out several years ahead. Finding the available resources to do it soon is a challenge.\u201d One likely scenario could involve building in segments, he added.\nThe cable, when completed, would give Meta a dedicated pipe for data traffic around the world. The planned route of the cable, says sources, currently sees it spanning from the east coast of the U.S. to India via South Africa, and then to the west coast of the U.S. from India via Australia \u2014 making a \u201cW\u201d shape around the globe, as visualized here by Tagare:\nMeta\u2019s infrastructure work is overseen by Santosh Janardhan, who is the company\u2019s head of global infrastructure and co-head of engineering. The company has teams globally who look at and plan out its infrastructure \u2014 and it has had some significant industry figures work for it in the past. In the case of this upcoming project, it is being conceived out of the company\u2019s South Africa operation, according to sources.\nFiber-optic subsea cables have been a part of communications infrastructure for the last 40 years. What\u2019s significant here is who is putting the money down to build and own it \u2014 and for what purposes.\nMeta\u2019s plans underscore how investment and ownership of subsea networks has shifted in recent years from consortiums involving telecoms carriers, to now also include big tech giants.\nMeta is not new to the subsea game. According to telecom analysts Telegeography, Meta is part-owner of 16 existing networks, including most recently the 2Africa cable that encircles the continent (others in that project are carriers including Orange, Vodafone, China Mobile, Bayobab/MTN and more).\nHowever, this new cable project would be the first wholly owned by Meta itself.\nThat would put Meta into the same category as Google, which has involvement in some 33 different routes, including a few regional efforts in which it is the sole owner, per Telegeography\u2019s tracking. Other big tech companies that are either part owners or capacity buyers in subsea cables include Amazon and Microsoft (neither of which are whole-owners of any route themselves).\nWhy Meta wants its own cable\nThere are a number of reasons why building subsea cables would appeal to big tech companies like Meta.\nFirst, sole ownership of the route and cable would give Meta first dibs in capacity to support traffic on its own properties.\nAccording to its earnings reports, Meta makes more money outside of North America than in its home market itself. Having priority on dedicated subsea cabling can help ensure quality of service on that traffic. (Note: this is just to ensure long-haul traffic: the company still has to negotiate with carriers within countries and in \u2018last-mile\u2019 delivery to users\u2019 devices, which can have its challenges.)\nMeta, like Google, also plays up the lift it has provided to regions by way of its subsea investments, claiming that projects like Marea in Europe and others in Southeast Asia have contributed more than \u201chalf a trillion dollars\u201d to economies in those areas.\nYet there is a more pragmatic impetus for these investments: tech companies \u2014 rather than telecoms carriers, traditional builders and owners of these cables \u2014 want to have more direct ownership of the pipes needed to deliver content, advertising and more to users around the world.\n\u201cThey make their money from their products being presented to end users, and they will do everything they can to ensure customer experience, whether that\u2019s delivery of video or other assets,\u201d said Scarborough, the analyst. \u201cFrankly, who\u2019s going to rely on traditional telcos anymore? Tech companies are now independent. They\u2019ve realized they\u2019ve got to build it themselves.\u201d\nThe second is geopolitical.\nSeveral times in recent years, subsea cables have been taken down as collateral or direct damage from warfare. Houthi fighters, backed by Iran, are going after boats and in the process are damaging cables in the Red Sea (such as this one connecting Europe to India). This month (November 2024), Russia was suspected of cutting a submarine cable in the Baltic Sea. Just this week, another cable went down in European waters, with a Chinese ship currently getting the blame.\nThe route as envisioned by Meta is intended to help the company \u201cavoid areas of geopolitical tension,\u201d a source close to the company told TechCrunch.\nTagare points out in his blog post that the route would avoid the Red Sea, the South China Sea, Egypt, Marseilles, the Straits of Malacca and Singapore \u2014 \u201call of whom are now major single points of failure.\u201d\nThe FCC\u2019s announcement this month (November 2024) that it plans to review submarine cable licensing for the first time in decades, partly due to national security and ownership of the cables, could potentially also figure as another fillip here: Meta would be the sole owner of a route through safe corridors.\nThere is a possible third reason for Meta\u2019s subsea vision, although it\u2019s more speculative.\nAccording to a theory of Tagare\u2019s, it is directly related to the cable terminating in India. He believes that Meta has an opportunity to build out data center capacity in the country specifically for training and working with AI models, and the subsea cable could play a role in that effort.\nHe points out that India\u2019s cost for compute bandwidth is a fraction of the price in the U.S., and many in India have been buzzing after a recent visit by Jensen Huang: in a meeting with Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani, the Nvidia CEO talked about India building its own AI infrastructure. Reliance, among other vendors, will be using Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips in future AI data centers.\n\u201cIndia could become the training capital of the world,\u201d Tagare said in an interview. He believes that Meta might well want to build AI training in the country around that infrastructure.\nAI is a big part of Meta\u2019s infrastructure roadmap. But beyond that, India is a huge market for Meta, topping estimates as the country with the most users by far on Facebook (more than 375 million users), Instagram (363 million), and WhatsApp (536 million) and those consumers are proving to be very enthusiast for newer features like its AI tools. With robust investments being made into the data center market in the country, India still has a lot of growth potential, so this fact alone makes it logical to have added India as a landing point in the operation.\nSources close to the project tell us that it\u2019s too soon to say whether AI is part of the equation for Meta in this project, describing it as part of the \u201clong tail\u201d of considerations and possibilities, along with whether Meta would open capacity to other users alongside itself.\nMeta declined to comment for this article.\n\ntitle3:\nCanadian news companies sue OpenAI\ndescription3:\nA group of Canadian news and media companies filed a lawsuit Friday against OpenAI, alleging that the ChatGPT maker has infringed their copyrights and unjustly enriched itself at their expense.\nThe companies behind the lawsuit include the Toronto Star, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Globe and Mail, and others who seek to win monetary damages and ban OpenAI from making further use of their work.\nThe news companies said that OpenAI has used content scraped from their websites to train the large language models that power ChatGPT \u2014 content that is \u201cthe product of immense time, effort, and cost on behalf of the News Media Companies and their journalists, editors, and staff.\u201d\nThe companies wrote in their suit that \u201crather than seek to obtain the information legally, OpenAI has elected to brazenly misappropriate the News Media Companies\u2019 valuable intellectual property and convert it for its own uses, including commercial uses, without consent or consideration.\u201d\nOpenAI is also facing copyright lawsuits from The New York Times, New York Daily News, YouTube creators, and authors including comedian Sarah Silverman.\nWhile OpenAI has signed licensing deals with publishers such as The Associated Press, Axel Springer, and Le Monde, the companies behind the new suit said they have \u201cnever received from OpenAI any form of consideration, including payment, in exchange for OpenAI\u2019s use of their Works.\u201d\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement that ChatGPT is used by \u201chundreds of millions of people around the world \u2026 to improve their daily lives, inspire creativity, and solve hard problems,\u201d and that its models are \u201ctrained on publicly available data, grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.\u201d\n\u201cWe collaborate closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search, and offer them easy ways to opt-out should they so desire,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThis new lawsuit comes shortly after Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism published a study finding that \u201cno publisher \u2014 regardless of degree of affiliation with OpenAI \u2014 was spared inaccurate representations of its content in ChatGPT.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nStudy of ChatGPT citations makes dismal reading for publishers\ndescription4:\nAs more publishers cut content licensing deals with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, a study put out this week by the Tow Center for Digital Journalism \u2014 looking at how the AI chatbot produces citations (i.e. sources) for publishers\u2019 content \u2014 makes for interesting, or, well, concerning, reading.\nIn a nutshell, the findings suggest publishers remain at the mercy of the generative AI tool\u2019s tendency to invent or otherwise misrepresent information, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re allowing OpenAI to crawl their content.\nThe research, conducted at Columbia Journalism School, examined citations produced by ChatGPT after it was asked to identify the source of sample quotations plucked from a mix of publishers \u2014 some of which had inked deals with OpenAI and some which had not.\nThe Center took block quotes from 10 stories apiece produced by a total of 20 randomly selected publishers (so 200 different quotes in all) \u2014 including content from The New York Times (which is currently suing OpenAI in a copyright claim); The Washington Post (which is unaffiliated with the ChatGPT maker); The Financial Times (which has inked a licensing deal); and others.\n\u201cWe chose quotes that, if pasted into Google or Bing, would return the source article among the top three results and evaluated whether OpenAI\u2019s new search tool would correctly identify the article that was the source of each quote,\u201d wrote Tow researchers Klaudia Ja\u017awi\u0144ska and Aisvarya Chandrasekar in a blog post explaining their approach and summarizing their findings.\n\u201cWhat we found was not promising for news publishers,\u201d they go on. \u201cThough OpenAI emphasizes its ability to provide users \u2018timely answers with links to relevant web sources,\u2019 the company makes no explicit commitment to ensuring the accuracy of those citations. This is a notable omission for publishers who expect their content to be referenced and represented faithfully.\u201d\n\u201cOur tests found that no publisher \u2014 regardless of degree of affiliation with OpenAI \u2014 was spared inaccurate representations of its content in ChatGPT,\u201d they added.\nUnreliable sourcing\nThe researchers say they found \u201cnumerous\u201d instances where publishers\u2019 content was inaccurately cited by ChatGPT \u2014 also finding what they dub \u201ca spectrum of accuracy in the responses\u201d. So while they found \u201csome\u201d entirely correct citations (i.e. meaning ChatGPT accurately returned the publisher, date, and URL of the block quote shared with it), there were \u201cmany\u201d citations that were entirely wrong; and \u201csome\u201d that fell somewhere in between.\nIn short, ChatGPT\u2019s citations appear to be an unreliable mixed bag. The researchers also found very few instances where the chatbot didn\u2019t project total confidence in its (wrong) answers.\nSome of the quotes were sourced from publishers that have actively blocked OpenAI\u2019s search crawlers. In those cases, the researchers say they were anticipating that it would have issues producing correct citations. But they found this scenario raised another issue \u2014 as the bot \u201crarely\u201d \u2018fessed up to being unable to produce an answer. Instead, it fell back on confabulation in order to generate some sourcing (albeit, incorrect sourcing).\n\u201cIn total, ChatGPT returned partially or entirely incorrect responses on 153 occasions, though it only acknowledged an inability to accurately respond to a query seven times,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cOnly in those seven outputs did the chatbot use qualifying words and phrases like \u2018appears,\u2019 \u2018it\u2019s possible,\u2019 or \u2018might,\u2019 or statements like \u2018I couldn\u2019t locate the exact article\u2019.\u201d\nThey compare this unhappy situation with a standard internet search where a search engine like Google or Bing would typically either locate an exact quote, and point the user to the website/s where they found it, or state they found no results with an exact match.\nChatGPT\u2019s \u201clack of transparency about its confidence in an answer can make it difficult for users to assess the validity of a claim and understand which parts of an answer they can or cannot trust,\u201d they argue.\nFor publishers, there could also be reputation risks flowing from incorrect citations, they suggest, as well as the commercial risk of readers being pointed elsewhere.\nDecontextualized data\nThe study also highlights another issue. It suggests ChatGPT could essentially be rewarding plagiarism. The researchers recount an instance where ChatGPT erroneously cited a website which had plagiarized a piece of \u201cdeeply reported\u201d New York Times journalism, i.e. by copy-pasting the text without attribution, as the source of the NYT story \u2014 speculating that, in that case, the bot may have generated this false response in order to fill in an info gap that resulted from its inability to crawl the NYT\u2019s website.\n\u201cThis raises serious questions about OpenAI\u2019s ability to filter and validate the quality and authenticity of its data sources, especially when dealing with unlicensed or plagiarized content,\u201d they suggest.\nIn further findings that are likely to be concerning for publishers which have inked deals with OpenAI, the study found ChatGPT\u2019s citations were not always reliable in their cases either \u2014 so letting its crawlers in doesn\u2019t appear to guarantee accuracy, either.\nThe researchers argue that the fundamental issue is OpenAI\u2019s technology is treating journalism \u201cas decontextualized content\u201d, with apparently little regard for the circumstances of its original production.\nAnother issue the study flags is the variation of ChatGPT\u2019s responses. The researchers tested asking the bot the same query multiple times and found it \u201ctypically returned a different answer each time\u201d. While that\u2019s typical of GenAI tools, generally, in a citation context such inconsistency is obviously suboptimal if it\u2019s accuracy you\u2019re after.\nWhile the Tow study is small scale \u2014 the researchers acknowledge that \u201cmore rigorous\u201d testing is needed \u2014 it\u2019s nonetheless notable given the high-level deals that major publishers are busy cutting with OpenAI.\nIf media businesses were hoping these arrangements would lead to special treatment for their content vs competitors, at least in terms of producing accurate sourcing, this study suggests OpenAI has yet to offer any such consistency.\nWhile publishers that don\u2019t have licensing deals but also haven\u2019t outright blocked OpenAI\u2019s crawlers \u2014 perhaps in the hopes of at least picking up some traffic when ChatGPT returns content about their stories \u2014 the study makes dismal reading too, since citations may not be accurate in their cases either.\nIn other words, there is no guaranteed \u201cvisibility\u201d for publishers in OpenAI\u2019s search engine even when they do allow its crawlers in.\nNor does completely blocking crawlers mean publishers can save themselves from reputational damage risks by avoiding any mention of their stories in ChatGPT. The study found the bot still incorrectly attributed articles to the New York Times despite the ongoing lawsuit, for example.\n\u2018Little meaningful agency\u2019\nThe researchers conclude that as it stands, publishers have \u201clittle meaningful agency\u201d over what happens with and to their content when ChatGPT gets its hands on it (directly or, well, indirectly).\nThe blog post includes a response from OpenAI to the research findings \u2014 which accuses the researchers of running an \u201catypical test of our product\u201d.\n\u201cWe support publishers and creators by helping 250 million weekly ChatGPT users discover quality content through summaries, quotes, clear links, and attribution,\u201d OpenAI also told them, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve collaborated with partners to improve in-line citation accuracy and respect publisher preferences, including enabling how they appear in search by managing OAI-SearchBot in their robots.txt. We\u2019ll keep enhancing search results.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
