    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday November 28), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nFTC reportedly opens antitrust investigation into Microsoft\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nThe FTC has launched an antitrust investigation into Microsoft, according to multiple reports that corroborate earlier reporting by the Financial Times.\nThe agency is said to be looking into whether Microsoft violated antitrust law in multiple segments of its business, including its public cloud, AI, and cybersecurity product lines. Of particular interest to the FTC is the way Microsoft bundles its cloud products with its office and security tools, says The New York Times.\nAs it notes, the aggressive move comes as the FTC\u2019s chair, Lina Khan, is likely to depart once Donald Trump enters office.\nIt\u2019s unclear if Trump will continue President Joe Biden\u2019s push to rein in big tech companies. Under Biden, the FTC sued Amazon and Meta, accusing them of stifling rivals, while the Justice Department sued Google over its dominance in ad technology and Apple for making it difficult for customers to leave its product ecosystem.\n\ntitle1:\nInvestigators think a Chinese ship purposefully cut critical data cables\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nEuropean investigators are saying that a Chinese commercial ship purposefully dragged its anchor in order to slash through two critical data cables, according to the The Wall Street Journal.\nThe Chinese ship had recently departed from Russia carrying Russian fertilizer when it crossed the Baltic Sea. Investigators say the alleged attack may have been orchestrated by Russian intelligence and do not think the Chinese government was involved. The Kremlin denied these claims.\nThe investigation is in a precarious spot: NATO states legally can\u2019t require the Chinese ship to pull into one of their ports, so Swedish and German officials are negotiating with the ship\u2019s owner in order to gain access to the boat and crew. The Wall Street Journal also reported that German police have dispatched drones to examine the broken cables and seabed.\nIt\u2019s far from the only incident this year where European officials suspect Russia of harming critical infrastructure. However, sabotage can be incredibly difficult to prove, and the officials have often stopped short of making direct accusations.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI gets $1.5 billion investment from SoftBank in tender offer\ndescription2:\nOpenAI is allowing employees to sell about $1.5 billion worth of shares in a new tender offer to SoftBank, CNBC has learned.\nThe new financing will allow the Japanese tech conglomerate to get an even larger slice of the AI startup and allow current and former OpenAI employees to cash out their shares, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC.\nEmployees will have until Dec. 24 to decide if they want to participate in the new tender offer, which has not previously been reported, one of the people said. The deal was spurred by SoftBank billionaire founder and CEO Masayoshi Son, who was persistent in asking for a larger stake in the startup after putting $500 million into OpenAI's last funding round, one of the people said.\nThe tender offer is not related to OpenAI's potential plans to restructure the firm to a for-profit business, one of the people said.\nOpenAI and SoftBank declined to comment.\nThe deal, which the people familiar with the matter said was carried out through SoftBank's Vision 2 fund, underscores Son's interest in the AI space and in backing the most valuable private players. SoftBank was an early investor in semiconductor company Arm, and Son said at a conference in October that he's saving \"tens of billions of dollars\" to make the \"next big move\" in artificial intelligence. He previously invested in Apple, Qualcomm and Alibaba.\nSoftBank's Vision Fund 2 recently invested in AI startups Glean, Perplexity and Poolside. SoftBank has about 470 portfolio companies and $160 billion in assets across its two vision funds.\nThe OpenAI investment matches SoftBank's eagerness to deploy cash, with a capital-intensive business model, a person close to Son told CNBC.\nEven without SoftBank's deep pockets, OpenAI has had no trouble raising billions in cash. Its valuation has climbed to $157 billion in the two years since it launched ChatGPT. OpenAI has raised about $13 billion from Microsoft , and it closed its latest $6.6 billion round in October, led by Thrive Capital and including participation from chipmaker Nvidia, SoftBank and others.\nThe company also received a $4 billion revolving line of credit, bringing its total liquidity to more than $10 billion. OpenAI expects about $5 billion in losses on $3.7 billion in revenue this year, CNBC confirmed in September with a person familiar with the situation.\n\ntitle3:\nPony AI's valuation hits $5.25B after Nasdaq debut\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nChinese autonomous driving technology company Pony AI started trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday at $15 per share, securing it a valuation of $5.25 billion. That opening price is 15% higher than Pony\u2019s offering price of $13, which itself was at the high end of its expected range.\nPony sold 20 million American depositary shares in its initial public offering, raising $260 million. Strategic investors also bought around $153 million worth of Pony AI shares in private placements. The deal\u2019s underwriters \u2014 Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities, Deutsche Bank, Huatai Securities, and Tiger Brokers \u2014 have the option to buy an additional 3 million shares.\nAll told, Pony\u2019s total proceeds could climb up to $452.4 million.\nFollowing WeRide and Zeekr, Pony is the latest Chinese tech company to brave the U.S. public market after a de facto ban from Beijing. Investors will be keeping a close eye on Pony\u2019s performance, particularly as both the U.S. and China seek to dominate advancements in autonomous vehicle technology.\nThis story has been updated to reflect Pony AI\u2019s opening price and new valuation.\n\ntitle4:\nUber's subscription service reportedly target of FTC probe\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nThe Federal Trade Commission is investigating Uber over whether it broke consumer protection laws by allegedly automatically signing people up for its Uber One subscription service and making it hard to cancel, according to Bloomberg News.\nThe investigation was opened earlier this year after the FTC received customer complaints. Uber told Bloomberg that its cancellation process \u201cfollows both the letter and the spirit of the law\u201d and claimed customers can cancel in 20 seconds or less.\nThe FTC has been pushing companies with subscription services to make them easier to cancel lately. In October, the commission finalized a so-called \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule that could impact everything from streaming services to gym memberships. But the rule is already being challenged in court.\nIn the days after Donald Trump won the presidential election, the FTC reportedly tried to get Uber to agree to a settlement \u2014 which Uber\u2019s lawyers apparently characterized as involving an \u201cenormous monetary amount.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
