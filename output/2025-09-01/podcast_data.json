Yet only 16% of digital transformations succeed, and that\u2019s only 4\u201311% in traditional industries. The main barriers? Weak leadership commitment, a rigid culture, and a lack of digital talent. LayerX offers an AI SaaS platform to help enterprises scale back-office automation.\nLayerX, a Japanese AI SaaS startup that enables businesses to cut back-office workload, has raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Technology Cross Ventures (TCV), marking the U.S. fund\u2019s first investment in a Japanese startup.\nThe company declined to disclose its valuation, but said both the valuation and the size of the round are among the largest ever raised by a seven-year-old Japanese startup at the Series B stage. Other investors, including MUFG Bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Innovation Partners, JAFCO Group, Keyrock Capital, Coreline Venture, and JP Investment, also joined the Series B round, bringing the total raised to $192.2 million.\nThe startup\u2019s key offerings include Bakuraku, a platform that automates corporate spending workflows, covering expense management, invoice processing, and corporate card operations \u2014 for more than 15,000 companies; Alterna, a retail digital securities investment platform developed in partnership with Mitsui & Co.; and Ai Workforce, a generative AI solution designed to streamline workflows and harness enterprise data.\nFounded in 2018 by serial entrepreneur Yoshinori Fukushima, who studied machine learning at the University of Tokyo and previously launched the news app Gunosy, which was later listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LayerX grew out of one of his digital transformation (DX) and blockchain projects.\nThe founder launched LayerX after identifying a significant bottleneck in Japan\u2019s enterprise workflows: paper-based invoice processing. This insight prompted the team to pivot into SaaS with their AI-driven platform, Bakuraku, Fukushima told TechCrunch, adding that the platform\u2019s AI-native user experience quickly gained traction, helping LayerX secure major strategic partnerships, including with MUFG, or Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, and paving the way for its latest funding round.\nDespite a wave of digitalization, many Japanese companies still rely on paper and Excel for expense reimbursements and invoice processing, the CEO continued. Domestically, the startup competes with Money Forward Cloud Keihi, freee, and Rakuraku Seisan. Globally, its rivals include SAP Concur, Rippling, Brex, Ramp, Spendesk, and Airbase. In the AI Workforce space, it faces competition from Harvey, Fukushima noted.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBakuraku differentiates itself with an AI-driven user experience. The company continuously upgrades automation features like \u201cauto-entry and document splitting\u201d, while also investing in AI agents and AI-enabled business processing outsourcing (BPO). Its team includes \u201cmore than 12 former CTOs and a Kaggle Grandmaster.\u201d Bakuraku offers a comprehensive, integrated platform covering \u201cexpense management, invoice processing, corporate cards, workflows, e-ledger compliance, attendance, and receivables\u2014all in one solution,\u201d Fukushima added.\nCEO of Layerx (Yoshinori Fukushima) and CTO of layerx (Yuki Matsumoto)\nThe startup has closed its Series B funding less than two years after securing its Series A in November 2023. Its signature platform, the Bakuraku Suite, has seen significant growth, the seven-year-old company said.\n\u201cWe passed 10,000 customers in February 2024 and reached 15,000 by April 2025, with more enterprise clients coming on board,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cHeadcount has also grown from about 220 employees in October 2023 to around 430 as of the end of July 2025.\u201d\nLayerX is on track to reach $68 million, equivalent to \u00a510 billion, faster than any SaaS company in Japan\u2019s history, according to the company. \u201cThe growth benchmark known as T2D3 was achieved ahead of schedule, and we expect to surpass the previous domestic record, which took eight years from product launch, in under five years,\u201d Fukushima said.\nAi Workforce counts Mitsui & Co. and MUFG Bank among its clients, while Bakuraku serves customers such as Ippudo, IRIS Ohyama, the Imperial Hotel, and Sekisui Chemical.\nLooking forward, the company targets approximately $680 million (\u00a5100 billion) in annual recurring revenue by fiscal year 2030, with roughly half expected to come from its AI agent business. It also plans to grow its workforce to around 1,000 employees by 2028.\n\ntitle1:\nSpace investing goes mainstream as VCs ditch the rocket science requirements\ndescription1:\nFive years ago, investor Katelin Holloway made what she calls a \u201cliteral moon shot\u201d investment. A founding partner of the generalist venture firm Seven Seven Six admits she and her team had \u201cno clue\u201d what rocket company Stoke Space was talking about when they pitched the firm on its reusable launch technology. \u201cWe knew full well we were not the specialist,\u201d she says.\nSince then, Holloway has also invested in Interlune, a company planning to harvest helium-3 from the moon and sell it back to Earth for quantum computing and medical imaging applications.\nHolloway is well aware of the skepticism these bets might attract. At the same time, her journey from space novice to investor reflects a broader change in venture capital, as VCs without aerospace engineering degrees increasingly back space startups. In fact, global venture investment in space technology reached $4.5 billion across 48 companies as of July, according to PitchBook; that\u2019s more than four times the amount that space startups attracted in 2024.\nWhat\u2019s driving this trend? For starters, SpaceX and other companies have substantially reduced launch costs, making space accessible to founders with applications-focused business models. \u201cWe are literally as a species sitting on the precipice of space becoming part of our day-to-day lives,\u201d Holloway told this editor in a recent episode of TC\u2019s StrictlyVC Download podcast. \u201cAnd I truly do not think the world understands that or is ready for it.\u201d\nThat has allowed VCs to look past companies that build rockets to startups that use space-based data and infrastructure for new applications like climate monitoring, intelligence gathering, and communications. They\u2019re also betting on orbital logistics, in-space manufacturing, satellite servicing, and lunar infrastructure development. Companies like Interlune represent this new category. For investors like Holloway, the appeal often lies at the \u201cspace tech meets climate tech\u201d intersection, meaning startups that want to avoid repeating Earth\u2019s environmental mistakes in space.\u201d\nGeopolitical tensions are also making defense-related space startups attractive because China\u2019s rapidly advancing space capabilities are driving increased U.S. investment. VCs can be a nervous lot, and defense spending \u2013 knowing the U.S. government provides a reliable customer base and validation for emerging technologies \u2013 gives them greater confidence in the commercial viability of space ventures. At the Department of the Air Force Summit in March, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, \u201cI feel like there\u2019s no way to ignore the fact that the next and most important domain of warfare will be the space domain.\u201d\nNumerous U.S. defense-focused space startups closed sizable rounds this year, including military-class orbital systems developer True Anomaly, which announced a $260 million Series C led by Accel in July; and satellite manufacturer K2 Space, which is right now working on its first government mission and closed a $110 million round in February co-led by Lightspeed Venture Capital and Altimeter Capital. The defense angle adds sheen to space investments that might otherwise seem too risky. Indeed, Holloway notes that helium-3, the gas that Interlune plans to harvest, also has national security applications, including detecting nuclear weapon movements.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAI is creating even more momentum, including at the intersection of geospatial analytics and intelligence. In March, for example, the first satellite launched from Fire Sat, a partnership between Google, nonprofit Earth Fire Alliance, and satellite builder Muon Space designed to detect wildfires from orbit. The collaboration, announced last year, plans to deploy more than 50 satellites specifically built for wildfire detection. Earth imaging operator Planet Labs has also teamed up with Anthropic to analyze Earth observation data.\nPerhaps most remarkably, the timetable for returns on these investments has shortened to a surprising degree. Traditional space companies required decades to generate returns, but today\u2019s VCs believe they can achieve liquidity within standard 10-year fund horizons. \u201cOur fund model hasn\u2019t changed, so we still have a 10-year horizon,\u201d Holloway explains. \u201cWe would not have made this investment if we did not think we could create outsized returns within 10 years.\u201d\nThat kind of schedule sounds ambitious, but the public markets certainly seem receptive to these new space companies. Space infrastructure company Voyager listed in New York in June with a $1.9 billion market cap and closed its first day up 82% from its IPO price. (Its shares have since fallen roughly 45%.) The 48-year-old space systems manufacturer Karman Space & Defense opened 30% above its listing price in February. (Its shares have risen nearly 60% more since then.)\nFor Interlune, Holloway envisions potential exits including strategic acquisitions by aerospace or defense giants, energy company purchases, or even a government buyout given the national security implications that she describes.\nAll these converging forces \u2013 cheaper launches, defense spending, AI applications, and compressed timelines for returns \u2013 are reshaping who can invest in space. Holloway\u2019s background \u2013 from public school teacher to Pixar script supervisor to Reddit\u2019s VP of People & Culture to venture capitalist \u2013 highlights the broader skill sets these companies actually need. While she\u2019s self-effacing when it comes to helium-3 harvesting physics, she brings operational chops.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, a company is a company,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re bringing humans together to build something hard, you need someone with a background in building strong companies.\u201d\nWhether the approach will pay off remains to be seen. The space economy is still mostly untested at scale, and many of these ambitious ventures face technical and regulatory hurdles that more traditional software startups have never encountered. But as more generalist VCs like Holloway place their bets, space is beginning to look less like a specialized niche and more like another buzzy sector where, if you have the operational know-how, you don\u2019t need to be a rocket scientist, too.\n\ntitle2:\nU.S. and Indian VCs just formed a $1B+ alliance to fund India's deep tech startups\ndescription2:\nEight U.S. and Indian venture capital and private equity firms \u2014 including storied investors Accel, Blume Ventures, Celesta Capital, and Premji Invest \u2014 have formed an unusual coalition to back India\u2019s deep tech startups, pledging more than $1 billion over the next decade to strengthen U.S.-India tech ties.\nThe alliance addresses longstanding funding concerns. In April, Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal drew criticism after slamming domestic startups for focusing on food delivery instead of innovation, contrasting them with Chinese firms in a presentation titled \u201cIndia vs. China: The Startup Reality Check.\u201d Several investors and founders countered that India lacks capital for deep tech ventures and said Goyal\u2019s comments overlooked the determination of founders building for the local market. The new alliance appears to address these concerns, aiming to channel long-term private capital into deep tech ventures that many founders say have struggled to secure funding in India.\nThe move stands out because investors typically compete for deals rather than formally band together under a named alliance with binding pledges. While VCs often co-invest on a deal-by-deal basis, most cross-border collaboration occurs informally through individual fund strategies, rather than through coordinated capital blocs.\nCalled the India Deep Tech Investment Alliance, the group brings together Celesta Capital, Accel, Blume Ventures, Gaja Capital, Ideaspring Capital, Premji Invest, Tenacity Ventures, and Venture Catalysts, the firms said in a joint statement on Tuesday. The launch follows the Indian government\u2019s approval of a \u20b91 trillion (approximately $11 billion) Research, Development, and Innovation (RDI) scheme, announced in the national budget earlier this year to boost deep tech R&D.\nUnder the alliance, each member will commit private capital over a 5- to 10-year period to Indian-domiciled deep tech startups, the firms said. For now, there are relatively few such companies, as many of India\u2019s best-known deep tech ventures with Indian founders are incorporated in the U.S. But New Delhi has made local incorporation a requirement for incentives under its new RDI scheme, which the alliance members aim to leverage.\nIn addition to funding, the members will offer mentorship and network access. The firms also plan to utilize the alliance to help their portfolio companies expand into the Indian market.\n\u201cThis is in line with the strategic interests of both India and the U.S. at the governmental level, focusing on critical and emerging technologies,\u201d said Celesta Capital managing partner Arun Kumar, who will be the inaugural chair of the alliance, in an interview.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nStill, the geopolitical backdrop is complicated. In February, President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the TRUST (Transforming the Relationship Utilizing Strategic Technology) initiative to deepen U.S.\u2013India tech ties. But relations soon showed strain, as Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods last month over New Delhi\u2019s continued purchases of Russian oil, a move analysts say has put the two leaders on opposite sides of a widening trade and geopolitical rift.\nDespite those tensions, the alliance \u2014 notwithstanding the geopolitical rift between the two leaders \u2014 is betting on India as a hub for startups developing foundational technologies such as AI, semiconductors, space, quantum, robotics, biotech, energy, and climate tech.\n\u201cWe find India as a particularly interesting market, not just for the opportunities that exist for new companies that get started in India, but also for companies in the U.S. that are seeking to expand into the Indian market,\u201d Sriram Vishwanathan, founding managing partner at Celesta Capital, told TechCrunch.\nCelesta Capital \u2014 an early backer of Indian startups such as space-tech venture Agnikul, drone maker IdeaForge, and AI-driven cancer diagnostics firm OneCell Diagnostics \u2014 spearheaded the effort after discussions with industry stakeholders and the Indian government.\n\u201cWe have put this thing together to actually energize the ecosystem and bring like-minded investors together,\u201d Vishwanathan said.\nThe alliance will focus on early-stage startups \u2014 from seed to Series B \u2014 while steering clear of late-stage investments, Vishwanathan noted. He also stated that the billion-dollar-plus commitment is just the beginning, as \u201cany long journey starts with the first step.\u201d\n\u201cYou could expect more firms to join this alliance, both financial VC firms and private equity firms,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should also expect corporates to join who have pretty significant investment programs.\u201d\nWhile the alliance does not set its own eligibility criteria for new members, Vishwanathan said participants must meet the Indian government\u2019s conditions under the RDI scheme \u2014 including investing in \u201csunrise\u201d sectors, backing India-domiciled startups, and securing local regulatory approvals.\n\u201cThe alliance is just a platform for engaging with the government,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nAs a group, the investors in the alliance plan to engage with the Indian government on policy and incentives to advance private industry\u2019s interests and act as a unified voice, Vishwanathan said.\nIn the past, regulatory changes rolled out without industry input have led to turmoil in India. Some such moves have drawn intense criticism from U.S. investors and were subsequently withdrawn following widespread outrage.\nThe alliance\u2019s members will share information voluntarily and coordinate on pipeline development, due diligence and co-investment opportunities, the firms said.\nAn advisory committee, comprising representatives from Accel, Premji Invest, and Venture Catalysts, among the early participants, will help establish shared objectives and ensure coordination while preserving the independence of each fund.\nKumar stated that while he is the inaugural chair, the alliance\u2019s leadership will rotate as it moves forward.\nThe alliance could prove a double-edged sword for Indian deep tech startups. While pooling long-term capital and giving a unified voice to the government appears to be a boon, there is risk if coordination falters, leaving promising companies caught in the gaps.\n\u201cOver the next decade, startups will build in India and export breakthrough solutions to the world. The tailwinds are in place: ambition, talent, policy intent, and patient capital,\u201d said Accel partner Anand Daniel in a prepared statement.\n\ntitle3:\nWhy Runway is eyeing the robotics industry for future revenue growth\ndescription3:\nRunway has spent the past seven years building visual-generating tools for the creative industry. Now, it sees a new opportunity for its technology: robotics.\nNew York-based Runway is known for its video and photo generation AI world models, or large language models that create a simulated version of the real world. Most recently, the company released Gen-4, its video-generating model, in March and Runway Aleph, its video editing model, in July.\nAs Runway\u2019s world models started to improve \u2014 and get more realistic \u2014 the company began to receive inbound interest from robotics and self-driving car companies looking to use the tech, Anastasis Germanidis, Runway co-founder and CTO, told TechCrunch in an interview.\n\u201cWe think that this ability to simulate the world is broadly useful beyond entertainment, even though entertainment is an ever increasing and big area for us,\u201d Germanidis said. \u201cIt makes it much more scalable and cost effective to train [robotic] policies that interact with the real world whether that\u2019s in robotics or in self driving.\u201d\nGermanidis said working with robotics and self-driving car companies was not something Runway initially envisioned when it launched back in 2018. It wasn\u2019t until robotics and other companies in other industries reached out, that the company realized their models had much broader use cases than they originally thought, he said.\nRobotics companies are using Runway\u2019s tech for training simulations, Germanidis said. He added that just training robots and self-driving cars in real-world scenarios is costly for companies, takes a long time, and is hard to scale.\nWhile Runway knows it isn\u2019t going to replace real-world training by any means, Germanidis said companies can get a lot of value running simulations on Runway\u2019s models because they have the ability to get incredibly specific.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nUnlike in real-world training, using these models makes it easier to test for specific variables and situations without changing anything else in the scenario, he added.\n\u201cYou can take a step back and then simulate the effect of different actions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the car took this turn over this, or perform this action, what will be the outcome of that? Creating those rollouts from the same context, is a really difficult thing to do in the physical world, to basically keep all the other aspects of the environment the same and only test the effect of the specific action you want to take.\u201d\nRunway isn\u2019t the only company looking to tackle this. For instance, Nvidia released the latest version of its Cosmos world models, in addition to other robot training infrastructure, earlier this month.\nThe company doesn\u2019t anticipate releasing a \u201ccompletely separate line of models\u201d for its robotics and self-driving car customers, Germanidis said. Instead, Runway will fine-tune its existing models to better serve these industries. The company is also building a dedicated a robotics team.\nGermanidis added that while these industries weren\u2019t in the company\u2019s initial pitches to investors, they are on board with this expansion. Runway has raised more than $500 million from investors like Nvidia, Google and General Atlantic at a $3 billion valuation.\n\u201cThe way we think of the company, is really built on a principle, rather than being on the market,\u201d Germanidis said. \u201cThat principle is this idea of simulation, of being able to build a better and better representation of the world. Once you have those really powerful models, then you can use them for a wide variety of different markets, a variety of different industries. [The] industries we expect are there already, and they\u2019re going to change even more as a result of the power of generative models.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nIndia's Offgrid raises $15M to make lithium optional for battery storage\ndescription4:\nLithium has become the default choice for battery-powered systems, but its limitations \u2014 from volatile supply chains to short lifespans \u2014 are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. Offgrid Energy Labs, a deep-tech startup based in India, wants to make lithium less central, especially when it comes to battery storage.\nThe seven-year-old startup, incubated at IIT Kanpur, has developed a proprietary zinc-bromine-based battery system as an alternative to lithium-ion technology. Called ZincGel, it delivers 80\u201390% of the energy efficiency of conventional lithium batteries, but at a significantly lower levelized cost of storage, the startup said.\nAs power demand grows worldwide, countries are ramping up efforts to expand renewable energy storage. India, as a prominent nation in this regard, aims to increase its non-fossil energy capacity tenfold \u2014 from 50 gigawatts to 500 gigawatts \u2014 by 2030. New Delhi is also targeting 236 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage capacity by 2031\u201332 and announced a \u20b954 billion (roughly $612 million) funding planin June to develop 30 gigawatt-hour battery storage systems in the country. However, like many global markets, India faces a key challenge: China\u2019s dominance over the lithium supply chain.\nOffgrid Energy Labs is betting that its ZincGel battery technology can ease supply constraints by using widely available materials and offering a more cost-effective alternative to lithium-based systems.\nNow, the startup has raised $15 million in Series A funding to scale up its operations. It plans to build a 10-megawatt-hour demonstration facility in the UK, expected to be ready by the first quarter of 2026, and begin commercializing ZincGel in the quarters that follow \u2014 with a gigafactory in India planned as the next phase.\n\u201cNot only should we be addressing a gap in the market from an application standpoint, but we should also make it financially viable, because there have been technologies and batteries in the past globally, which have the solution, but they\u2019re so expensive that they\u2019re not widely adopted,\u201d said Tejas Kusurkar, co-founder and CEO of Offgrid Energy Labs, in an interview.\nKusurkar, who has a Ph.D. from IIT Kanpur, co-founded Offgrid Energy Labs in 2018 at the institute\u2019s Startup Incubation and Innovation Center, along with Brindan Tulachan (also a Ph.D. from IIT Kanpur), Rishi Srivastava, and Ankur Agarwal. The team observed that while lithium batteries are well-suited for mobility, the stationary storage market was underserved \u2014 and needed batteries that are safer, more resilient, and built on a supply chain that is easier to access, Kusurkar told TechCrunch.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe startup spent its first six years developing battery technology and has so far secured more than 25 IP families and over 50 IP assets across markets, including the U.S., U.K., India, as well as China, Australia, and Japan. The battery is based on zinc-bromide chemistry with a proprietary water-based electrolyte, resulting in a low risk of fire.\nZincGel is also capable of handling longer discharges (6\u201312 hours) multiple times throughout its lifetime and can last twice as long as a typical lithium-ion battery, Kusurkar said. Furthermore, the battery utilizes a carbon-based cathode for both fast charging and discharging.\nOffgrid Energy Labs Co-founders Rishi K Srivastava, Brindan Tulachan, Ankur Agarwal, and Tejas Kusurkar (Left to Right)\nZinc in batteries is not a new concept, and some companies have already offered zinc-bromide-based batteries, including the Nasdaq-listed EOS Energy Enterprises. However, Kusurkar noted that Offgrid Energy Labs uses its patented assets that help bring down the cost. The ZincGel batteries can also reduce the need for using graphite, which helps bring down their production cost.\n\u201cUltimately, customers care about the same performance, better price, or better performance, same price,\u201d Srivastava told TechCrunch.\nOffgrid Energy Labs\u2019 technology is also designed to allow for tweaking or sub-optimizing the battery based on the application. This means that these zinc batteries can operate independently of environmental conditions and provide energy storage even at temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius, Srivastava said.\nThe startup is targeting industries with net-zero goals that want to maximize renewable energy use by integrating battery storage. Its batteries are also being explored for applications such as peak shifting and decentralized, off-grid energy solutions. Shell \u2014 which invested in Offgrid during its seed round through its corporate venture arm \u2014 and Tata Power are among the early testers. The start is also in talks with global players, including Europe\u2019s Enel Group, to develop batteries tailored to their specific use cases.\nSo far, Offgrid Energy Labs has built its battery tech manually at a tinkering lab in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s Noida. However, the startup plans to leverage its facility in the U.K. to demonstrate its technology to early customers next year.\nThe UK facility will have a carbon footprint 50% lower than that of a typical lithium battery gigafactory, Srivastava said, adding that the startup has opted for simpler manufacturing processes to reduce both capital and operational expenses.\nAsked why the U.K. \u2014 and not India \u2014 was chosen for its first facility, Srivastava said, as Europe offers a strong ecosystem and is already a hub for battery manufacturing. The startup already has co-founders Kusurkar and Tulachan based in the U.K. to help with local operations. Still, the startup sees India as one of its key markets once the batteries are ready for commercialization in 2026.\nThe Series A round was led by Archean Chemicals, a Chennai-based specialty chemicals manufacturer, which now holds a 21% stake in the startup, along with participation from Ankur Capital.\nSrivastava told TechCrunch that Archean\u2019s participation is a strategic alignment, as the publicly listed company has considerable expertise in bromine manufacturing and supply chain management.\nThe startup is valued at around $58 million post-money.\"\n\nResponse:",
