    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday November 14), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple faces UK 'iCloud monopoly' compensation claim worth $3.8 billion\ndescription0:\nU.K. consumer rights group \u2018Which?\u2019 is filing a legal claim against Apple under competition law on behalf of some 40 million users of iCloud, its cloud storage service.\nThe collective proceeding lawsuit, which is seeking \u00a33 billion in compensation damages (around $3.8 billion at current exchange rates), alleges that Apple has broken competition rules by giving its own cloud storage service preferential treatment and effectively locking people into paying for iCloud at \u201crip-off\u201d prices.\n\u201ciOS has a monopoly and is in control of Apple\u2019s operating systems and it is incumbent on Apple not to use that dominance to gain an unfair advantage in related markets, like the cloud storage market. But that is exactly what has happened,\u201d Which wrote in a press release announcing filing the claim with the U.K.\u2019s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).\nThe lawsuit accuses Apple of encouraging users of its devices to sign up to iCloud for photo storage and other data storage needs, while simultaneously making it difficult for consumers to use alternative storage providers \u2014 including by not allowing them to store or back-up all of their phone\u2019s data with a third-party provider.\n\u201ciOS users then have to pay for the service once photos, notes, messages and other data go over the free 5GB limit,\u201d Which noted.\nThe suit also accuses Apple of overcharging U.K. consumers for iCloud subscriptions owing to the lack of competition. \u201cApple raised the price of iCloud for UK consumers by between 20% and 29% across its storage tiers in 2023,\u201d it wrote, saying it\u2019s seeking damages for all affected Apple customers \u2014 and estimating that individual consumers could be owed an average of \u00a370 (around $90), depending on how long they\u2019ve been paying Apple for iCloud services.\nA similar lawsuit \u2014 arguing Apple unlawfully monopolized the market for cloud storage \u2014 was filed in the U.S. back in March, and remains pending after the company failed to get it tossed.\nU.K.-based consumers opted in\nThe U.K. claim is being being brought on an opt-out basis for U.K.-based consumers who are eligible to be included. Consumers who live outside the U.K. and believe they are eligible to be included must actively opt-in to join the action.\nWhich spokesman Tommy Handley told us eligible Apple customers include \u201canyone who has \u2018obtained\u2019 iCloud services, including non-paying users, over the nine-year timeframe since the Consumer Rights Act came into force on October 1st, 2015.\nHandley also confirmed that the \u00a33 billion compensation figure accounts for potential opt-outs, duplicates and mortality.\nWhich is a non-profit but the litigation is being funded by Litigation Capital Management (LCM), a major global litigation funder, which it says has committed to seeing the action through to the end.\nAt the same time, Which is urging Apple to resolve the claim without the need for litigation \u2014 by offering consumers their money back and opening up iOS to allow users \u201ca real choice\u201d for cloud services.\nCommenting in a statement, Which\u2019s chief executive Anabel Hoult said: \u201cBy bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions. Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.\u201d\nAssuming Apple doesn\u2019t seek to settle out of court, the next stage for the litigation will hinge on whether the CAT grants permission for Which to act as a class representative for consumers and allows the claim to proceed on a collective basis.\nThere has been an uptick in class action-style competition suits against Big Tech in recent years following a wave of antitrust enforcements on both sides of the Atlantic that\u2019s still playing out in terms of full outcomes and business impact.\nIn the U.K. Apple has also been targeted in a class-action style antitrust suit brought on behalf of developers last year, in relation to App Store fees.\nAlso last year, a separate U.K. suit targeted Apple and Amazon alleging price collusion.\n\ntitle1:\nAmazon takes on Temu and Shein with discount 'Amazon Haul' store\ndescription1:\nAmazon has rolled out its answer to the discounted, low-cost storefronts of Temu and Shein. The Amazon Haul store, currently available on the mobile app or mobile web browser exclusively, offers similar mass-produced, discounted items, most of which ship from China. It\u2019s a departure from Amazon\u2019s long-established reputation as a powerhouse of rapid delivery times since even Amazon can\u2019t reduce the time it takes to get these overseas goods.\nThe landing page for Amazon Haul is reminiscent of Shein and Temu even in its design: Items appear in grids, rather than Amazon\u2019s typical list, and shipping times and star ratings aren\u2019t visible unless you click on an item. Some items are labeled with rocket ship emojis that warn that this $4.99 iPhone 16 Pro case is \u201cselling fast!\u201d Or, you might see a fire emoji declaring that the price for a three-pack of $2.89 mesh laundry bags is \u201ccrazy low.\u201d Like its competitors, Amazon Haul also sells clothing ($16 for a pair of men\u2019s golf pants, or $4.99 for 80s-style women\u2019s leg warmers). In a \u201cStaples\u201d section, you can find an assortment of\u2026 sponges, resistance bands, hoodies, silicon baking mats, and socks.\nImage Credits:Amazon, screenshots by TechCrunch\n\u201cWhile Amazon continues to offer over 300 million items with fast, free delivery for Prime members [\u2026] we also hear from customers that sometimes they would love to shop ultra-low-priced products even if some of them take one to two weeks to arrive,\u201d Amazon wrote in a blog post.\nTemu and Shein have been subject to wide criticism over their environmental impact, a byproduct of their worldwide shipping, and the waste caused by fast fashion. Both companies have also been subject to consumer protection probes in the European Union, where regulators are investigating their potential use of addictive design patterns and illegal products.\nDespite the controversy surrounding them, these low-cost retailers remain incredibly popular among Gen Z. According to research from app intelligence firm Appfigures, the most popular app among U.S. users ages 18 to 24 was Temu, with almost 42 million downloads in that demographic between January and October 2024. For Shein, that estimate is about 14.7 million downloads, though it\u2019s possible that the difference in download numbers is that stark because Gen Z users have already downloaded Shein, which has been around longer than Temu.\nOne risk for Shein and Temu is that consumers may not feel comfortable making purchases from unknown sellers that could potentially be misleading; consumers have more existing trust in Amazon, but the company is working with similar, largely China-based sellers of mass-produced goods. However, Amazon claims that it screens sellers ahead of time, and if customers want to return their purchase, they can do so for free within 15 days as long as the item is over $3.\nIt\u2019s a dubious time for Amazon to invest in this business model, given that president-elect Donald Trump has proposed leveraging a 60% tax on imported Chinese goods. This tariff plan isn\u2019t set in stone, though \u2014 it\u2019s common for politicians to shift their campaign platforms after they\u2019ve secured a win.\nHowever, the popularity of Chinese e-commerce shipments has attracted bipartisan attention. The Biden administration has already proposed congressional action to crack down on what it calls \u201csignificant increased abuse\u201d by Chinese e-commerce companies of the \u201cde minimis\u201d exception. The de minimis exemption allows shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty free, which helps retailers like Temu and Shein maintain such low margins.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla issues sixth Cybertruck recall in a year\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nTesla\u2019s Cybertruck is facing its sixth recall since its launch a year ago.\nThe recall affects 2,431 units, including certain 2024 Cybertrucks built between November 6, 2023 and July 30, 2024. A report from Tesla found that those trucks are or were equipped with a faulty drive inverter.\n\u201cIf the inverter stops producing torque, the driver loses the ability to apply torque to the vehicle using the accelerator pedal resulting in a loss of propulsion, which may increase the risk of a collision,\u201d reads Tesla\u2019s report.\nIn October, Tesla recalled 27,185 Cybertrucks due to a delay in the rearview camera image that could impair driver visibility. Unlike that recall, which required an over-the-air update, Tesla will need to physically replace the recalled drive inverter, which the EV-maker said it would do free of charge.\nOther Cybertruck recalls this year include one in April due to a sticky accelerator pedal, and another in June to fix potentially loose trim pieces and defective windshield wipers.\n\ntitle3:\nKlarna kickstarts US IPO plans with confidential SEC filing\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nSwedish buy now, pay later (BNPL) startup Klarna is on its way to becoming a public company. The fintech said on Wednesday that it has confidentially filed a draft registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe announcement of the listing, a long time in the making, arrives amid a dearth of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the technology sector. Klarna\u2019s European status only adds more fervor to today\u2019s news.\nFounded in 2005, Klarna is one of several players in the BNPL space that enable customers to purchase goods with the promise of interest-free credit. After launching in the U.S. in 2015, Klarna hit a hefty valuation of more than $45 billion by 2021, a figure that swiftly plummeted by 85% to $6.5 billion due to market \u201ccorrections.\u201d\nHowever, Klarna\u2019s valuation recently rose to $14.6 billion, according to reports, after one investor increased its stake.\nWe still don\u2019t know how many shares will be offered, or the price range of the IPO, but today\u2019s announcement paves the way for Klarna to go public likely some time in the first half of 2025.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI's take on AI agents could come in January\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI could release an \u201cAI agent\u201d tool as soon as January.\nThat\u2019s according to Bloomberg, which reports that OpenAI is close to launching software, code-named \u201cOperator,\u201d that can take direct actions on a person\u2019s computer. OpenAI is said to be planning to initially launch Operator as a research preview through its developer API.\nOperator would go up against Anthropic\u2019s recently unveiled agent feature, Computer Use, and Google\u2019s rumored consumer-focused agent, among others. It\u2019s unclear whether OpenAI\u2019s will have any advantage; Bloomberg reports that it could take the form of a general-purpose tool that executes tasks in a web browser.\nThe report on Operator arrived the same day as the release of OpenAI\u2019s policy paper with suggestions for the U.S.\u2019 AI strategy. That paper reportedly proposes, among other things, that the federal government create AI-focused \u201ceconomic zones\u201d permitting work to build AI infrastructure, and the establishment of a bloc with U.S. allies to compete with China on AI.\"\n\nResponse:",
