Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

If ByteDance follows through, it will become one of the world\u2019s top owners of Nvidia chips, despite U.S. efforts to restrict Chinese companies from buying U.S. AI chips like these.\nIn 2022, the U.S. announced export restrictions on certain kinds of AI chips to countries, including China, where ByteDance is headquartered. These restrictions have gotten tighter multiple times since.\nByteDance is technically adhering to these restrictions by using a loophole: The company isn\u2019t bringing the chips directly to China and is instead storing them in data centers located in other regions like Southeast Asia, according to The Information\u2019s reporting. This doesn\u2019t technically violate U.S. restrictions.\nByteDance runs Doubao, China\u2019s \u201chottest\u201d AI chatbot with 51 million active users, according to the South China Morning Post.\nTechCrunch reached out to ByteDance for more information.\n\ntitle1:\nUS Treasury says China accessed government documents in 'major' cyberattack\ndescription1:\nThe U.S. Treasury told lawmakers in a letter Monday that it was hit by a cyberattack earlier in December, which the department has attributed to Chinese government hackers.\nIn the letter shared with senior U.S. House lawmakers, which TechCrunch has seen, the Treasury said the hackers gained remote access to certain Treasury employee workstations and had access to unclassified documents, in what it described as a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d\nThe Treasury said it was notified on December 8 by BeyondTrust, a company that provides identity access and remote support tech for large organizations and government departments, that hackers had \u201cgained access to a key used by the vendor\u201d for providing remote access technical support to Treasury employees. BeyondTrust disclosed the incident at the time, but did not say how the key was obtained.\nA spokesperson for BeyondTrust did not respond to a request for comment at press time.\nThe letter said the department engaged U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA for assistance and, as of December 30, it has \u201cno evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.\u201d\nThe Treasury confirmed in the letter that it attributed the breach to a China state-sponsored advanced persistent threat group, indicating backing from the Chinese government. It\u2019s not clear which group was behind the intrusion, and a spokesperson would not say.\nIn a brief statement, Treasury spokesperson Michael Gwin said that the hackers were able to \u201cremotely access several Treasury user workstations and certain unclassified documents maintained by those users.\u201d\n\u201cTreasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds. Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThis is the latest cyberattack linked to China that has targeted the U.S. government in recent months. China-backed hackers dubbed Salt Tycoon were behind a wave of cyberattacks targeting U.S. phone companies and internet giants, including AT&T and Verizon, in a bid to get access to the private communications of senior U.S. government officials, including presidential candidates.\nLiu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., denied the U.S. government\u2019s attribution of the cyberattack to the Chinese government, arguing that the United States did not present evidence of its claims.\nUpdated with comment from the Chinese government.\nDo you know more about the BeyondTrust cyberattack or the incident at the Treasury?

Some of the location data was accurate to a few centimeters, they said, with the data showing most of the vehicles found across Germany, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom (in descending order), among others.\nCariad fixed the bug that led to the exposure and said that it has no evidence to suggest anyone other than the security researchers had access to the exposed data. Cariad has struggled in recent years, plagued by delays to major software launches and a restructuring that has eliminated hundreds of jobs.\n\ntitle3:\nBlue Origin looks to take on SpaceX dominance with New Glenn launch days away\ndescription3:\nNearly a quarter century after its founding, Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin is gearing up to launch an orbital rocket for the first time \u2014 and finally enter the competitive launch industry that is currently dominated by SpaceX.\nCompany executives have maintained that they are planning to launch the towering rocket, called New Glenn, before the year is out. However, an air traffic advisory posted last week suggests that Blue Origin may conduct the launch no earlier than January 6.\nRegardless, there is little left for the company to do in terms of pre-launch tests or paperwork: Blue Origin received its launch license for New Glenn from federal regulators last week, which authorizes launches for five years. That same day, the company successfully conducted a launch dress rehearsal called a hot fire test. All that\u2019s left on the checklist, Blue Origin CEO David Limp confirmed, is connecting the fairing, which carries the rocket\u2019s payload.\nWhen the rocket does finally launch, seven of the Blue Origin-made BE-4 engines will fire up to generate over 3.8 million pounds of thrust and propel the rocket away from its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The 320-foot-tall rocket will carry demonstrator technology for Blue Origin\u2019s Blue Ring spacecraft, an orbital transfer vehicle that\u2019s designed to provide transportation, logistics, and satellite servicing.\nNew Glenn and Blue Ring are just two of several products Blue Origin has been developing to compete in multiple areas of the space industry. The company is ultimately looking to go up against several competitors \u2014 not just up against SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, which currently launches the lion\u2019s share of national security and commercial satellite payloads \u2014 that are developing lunar landers, private space stations, and more.\nUp until this point, Blue Origin has mostly been known for its New Shepard suborbital rocket, which carries space tourists and some cargo up to suborbital space and back in brief flights.\nIf all goes to plan, New Glenn\u2019s booster will return to Earth and land vertically on a floating barge, to be refurbished and reused up to 25 times. NASA also tapped Blue Origin to launch twin spacecraft to Mars \u2014 those satellites were supposed to fly on this inaugural mission, but after the launch was delayed from October, the space agency decided to remanifest them on a later New Glenn launch. Blue Origin also has signed launch deals with the Space Force, Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper, and other commercial companies.\n\ntitle4:\nNvidia completes acquisition of AI infrastructure startup Run:ai\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nNvidia has completed its acquisition of Run:ai, an Israeli startup that helps manage and optimize AI hardware infrastructure.\nAs part of the merger, Run:ai said its software, which currently only works with Nvidia products, will be open sourced, meaning Nvidia rivals like AMD and Intel will be able to adapt it for their hardware.\n\u201cWe are eager to build on the achievements we\u2019ve obtained until now, expand our talented team, and grow our product and market reach,\u201d Run:ai told Bloomberg in a statement. \u201cOpen sourcing the software will enable it to extend its availability to the entire AI ecosystem.\u201d\nNvidia announced its intent to acquire Run:ai in April. At the time, sources told TechCrunch that the price tag was $700 million. But the deal ran into regulatory hurdles. The European Commission and U.S. Department of Justice launched separate investigations into whether Nvidia\u2019s purchase would harm competition.\nThe European Commission approved the deal in December.\"\n\nResponse:",
