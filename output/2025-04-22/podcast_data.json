Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday April 23), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nIntel reportedly plans to lay off over 21,000 employees\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nIntel is set to cut over 21,000 people, or roughly 20% of its workforce, with an announcement due this week, according to a Bloomberg report.\nThe news comes ahead of Intel\u2019s Q1 earnings call helmed by recently appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced longtime chief Pat Gelsinger last year.\nWith the layoffs, Tan aims to \u201cstreamline management and rebuild an engineering-driven culture,\u201d according to Bloomberg. The company had around 108,900 employees at the end of last year after it announced 15,000 job cuts in August 2024.\nIntel has been struggling for quite some time; over the past five years, the company\u2019s stock has dipped around 67%. Since assuming the role of CEO toward the end of 2024, Tan has moved to spin divisions of Intel into \u201cnon-core\u201d units. Earlier this month, Intel sold 51% of its Altera semiconductor business to private equity firm Silver Lake.\nIntel didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nTesla profits drop 71% on weak sales and anti-Elon Musk sentiment\ndescription1:\nTesla\u2019s flailing sales figures have put the company closer to the red than it has been in years, according to financial results released Tuesday, threatening one of its biggest advantages over other EV players.\nThe electric automaker reported $409 million in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue after delivering almost 337,000 EVs in the first quarter of the year. The company\u2019s net income reflects a 71% drop from the same quarter last year.\nIt was the worst quarter for Tesla deliveries in more than two years and came on the heels of the company\u2019s first-ever year-to-year drop in sales. Tesla\u2019s income was buffered by selling $595 million in zero-emissions tax credits, according to its earnings report \u2014 without those, it would have posted a loss.\nAnd yet, Tesla stock rose in after-hours trading as investors put more weight on the company\u2019s plans to begin production on an affordable EV in June and CEO Elon Musk\u2019s comments during an earnings call that he would reduce his role with the Department of Government Efficiency to focus more attention on Tesla. Musk did not commit to ending his DOGE work altogether though, noting he may continue in some capacity through the remainder of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.\nTechCrunch published a roundup of other Musk comments covering tariffs, robotaxis, AI, and EVs, during Tesla\u2019s earnings call.\nTesla also cautioned shareholders about how the trade war may affect its business moving forward. The company said President Trump\u2019s tariffs and \u201cchanging political sentiment\u201d could have a \u201cmeaningful impact on demand for our products.\u201d\nThe company noted the current tariffs, the bulk of which are directed at China, will have \u201ca relatively larger impact on our Energy business compared to automotive.\u201d Tesla said it is taking actions to stabilize the business in the medium to long term and focus on maintaining its health, but it also cautioned investors that it can\u2019t say whether it will be able to grow sales this year.\nTesla is sticking to its ambitious (but mysterious) plans around making more affordable models, stating it remains on track for start of production of these vehicles in the first half of 2025. During the earnings call, Musk was more specific, stating production would begin in June.\nThese vehicles will use aspects of a next-generation platform that powers the robotaxi, but will rely on its existing one that powers the Model Y and Model 3, the company said in its shareholder\u2019s letter. As such, these cheaper vehicles will be produced on the same manufacturing lines as the current vehicle lineup, the company said.\nThis flies in the face of a Reuters report from last week that claimed the first of these new EVs is delayed by months.\nTesla\u2019s sales are up against a number of headwinds.\nThe company\u2019s EV lineup is aging (though the sedans and SUVs have now all gotten face-lifts) and its newest product, the Cybertruck, is nowhere near the hit that CEO Elon Musk thought it could be. And Musk\u2019s far-right politics, along with his involvement in the Trump administration, have created a sizable backlash to Tesla\u2019s brand.\nAt the same time, Musk has oriented the company toward its Robotaxi and Optimus robot projects.\nHe has promised to launch an initial version of the Robotaxi service in Austin this June, with other cities potentially coming by the end of this year, but has been light on details about how it will work.\nMusk has yet to demonstrate that Teslas are capable of driving themselves without human intervention despite years of making that promise. What\u2019s more, The Information recently reported that an internal analysis done at Tesla showed the Robotaxi program would lose money for a long period of time even if it were to work.\nAt this time last year, Tesla was grappling with some gloomy numbers. In case you forgot, the company\u2019s profits fell 55% to $1.13 billion in the first quarter of 2024 from the same period in 2023. Tesla said it was due to a protracted EV price-cutting strategy and \u201cseveral unforeseen challenges\u201d cut into the automaker\u2019s bottom line.\nTesla tried to turn that profit ship around, but faced continued pressure. In Q2 of 2024, Tesla reported $1.5 billion in profit, down 45% from the same period in 2023. Profits were hit by a $622 million restructuring charge. Although it\u2019s worth noting, that profit was padded by a record $890 million in regulatory credit sales.\nThis article originally published at 1:15 pm PT. It has since been updated with comments from Elon Musk and other executives from the earnings call.\n\ntitle2:\nxAI's Grok chatbot can now 'see' the world around it\ndescription2:\nxAI\u2019s Grok chatbot can now answer questions about what\u2019s in view of your smartphone\u2019s camera, similar to real-time vision features available for Google\u2019s Gemini and ChatGPT.\nOn Tuesday, xAI announced the launch of Grok Vision, which lets users point their phone at objects like products, signs, and documents and ask questions about them. Grok Vision is accessible from the Grok app for iOS, but not the Grok Android app just yet.\nOther new capabilities launching for Grok today include multilingual audio and real-time search in Grok\u2019s voice mode. Grok users on Android can tap those, but only if they\u2019re subscribed to xAI\u2019s $30-per-month SuperGrok plan.\nGrok has been gaining new features at a steady clip. Earlier this month, xAI added a \u201cmemory\u201d component to Grok that lets the bot pull on details from past conversations. Grok also got a canvas-like tool for creating docs and apps.\n\ntitle3:\nMeta's Oversight Board seeks details on the company's new hate speech policies\ndescription3:\nMeta\u2019s Oversight Board, the independent group created to help Meta with content moderation decisions, on Tuesday issued its response to the social media company\u2019s new hate speech policies announced in January.\nThe Board says that Meta\u2019s new policies were \u201cannounced hastily, in a departure from regular procedure,\u201d and called on the company to provide more information about its rules. In addition, the Board asked Meta to asses the impact of its new policies on vulnerable user groups, report those findings publicly, and update the Board every six months.\nThe Board says it\u2019s in discussions with Meta to retool its fact-checking policies in regions outside the U.S., as well.\nJust weeks before President Donald Trump took office, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg embarked on an overhaul of the company\u2019s content moderation policies in an effort to allow \u201cmore speech\u201d on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. As part of this push, Meta rolled back hate speech rules that protected immigrants and LGBTQIA+ users across its various platforms.\nRegarding Meta\u2019s new policies, the Board says it issued 17 recommendations to Meta that, among other things, ask the company to measure the effectiveness of its new community notes system, clarify its revised stance on hateful ideologies, and improve how it enforces violations of its harassment policies. The Board says it has also asked Meta to uphold its 2021 commitment to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by engaging with stakeholders impacted by the new policies. The Board says Meta should have done so in the first place.\nThe Oversight Board is limited in its ability to steer Meta\u2019s broader policies. However, Meta must follow its rulings on individual posts, per the company\u2019s own rules.\nShould Meta grant the Board a policy advisory opinion referral \u2014 something it\u2019s done a few times before \u2014 the group might have a channel to reshape Meta\u2019s content moderation.\nIn decisions published on 11 cases concerning issues across Meta\u2019s platforms \u2014 including anti-migrant speech, hate speech targeting people with disabilities, and suppression of LGBTQIA+ voices \u2014 the Oversight Board appeared to criticize several of the new content policies Zuckerberg announced earlier this year. Meta\u2019s January policy changes did not affect the outcome of these decisions, the Board said.\nIn two U.S. cases involving videos of transgender women on Facebook and Instagram, the Board upheld Meta\u2019s decision to leave the content up, despite user reports. However, the Board recommends that Meta remove the term \u201ctransgenderism\u201d from its Hateful Conduct policy.\nThe Board overturned Meta\u2019s decision to leave up three Facebook posts concerning anti-immigration riots that occurred in the U.K. during the summer of 2024. The Board found that Meta acted too slowly to remove anti-Muslim and anti-immigration content that violated the company\u2019s violence and incitement policies.\n\ntitle4:\nChatGPT\u2019s responses will now include Washington Post articles\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI and The Washington Post just announced a new content partnership that will see ChatGPT summarize and link to the Post\u2019s original reporting in its answers.\nThis is OpenAI\u2019s latest media partnership, with the AI giant inking deals with over 20 news publishers so far, including outlets like The Guardian and Axios.\nThe Washington Post says it will benefit from ChatGPT\u2019s vast audience, with the chatbot now counting more than 500 million users. Meanwhile, OpenAI will benefit from higher-quality answers based on the Post\u2019s \u201ctimely, well-sourced reporting\u201d per its press release.\nFinancial terms of the deal are undisclosed and The Washington Post declined to share when asked. OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOpenAI has been embraced by some newsrooms, but not all: The New York Times, for example, is suing OpenAI for allegedly using its copyrighted work, a charge OpenAI denies.\"\n\nResponse:",
