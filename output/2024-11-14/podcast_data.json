Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Sources told FT that the FTC is also investigating claims Microsoft hiked subscription fees for customers who wanted to leave, made its products incompatible with rivals, and charged steep exit fees.\nLast year, the FTC sought public comment on major cloud providers\u2019 business practices. Most commenters highlighted restrictive software licensing, minimum spend contracts, and high data transfer fees as areas of anticompetitive concern.\nIt\u2019s unclear how far the FTC\u2019s investigation will progress. FTC chair Lina Khan\u2019s tenure may end with the start of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, and Trump is generally perceived as on the side of deregulation.\n\ntitle1:\nMusk's amended lawsuit against OpenAI names Microsoft as defendent\ndescription1:\nMusk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI accusing the company of abandoning its nonprofit mission was withdrawn in July, only to be revived in August. Now, in an amended complaint, the suit names new defendants including Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former OpenAI board member and Microsoft VP Dee Templeton, and California attorney general Rob Bonta.\nThe amended filing also names new plaintiffs: Neuralink exec and ex-OpenAI board member Shivon Zilis and Musk\u2019s AI company, xAI.\nIn the complaint, lawyers for Musk argue that OpenAI is \u201cactively trying to eliminate competitors\u201d such as xAI by \u201cextracting promises from investors not to fund them.\u201d It\u2019s also benefitting from Microsoft\u2019s investments, infrastructure, and expertise in what Musk\u2019s counsel describes as a \u201cde facto\u201d merger.\n\u201cxAI has been harmed by, without limitation [by] \u2026 an inability to license OpenAI technology given Microsoft\u2019s exclusive license \u2026 an inability to obtain compute from Microsoft on terms anywhere near as favorable as OpenAI receives \u2026 and the exclusive exchange between OpenAI and Microsoft of competitively sensitive information.\u201d\nHoffman\u2019s position on the boards of both Microsoft and OpenAI while also a partner at Greylock, the investment firm, gave Hoffman a privileged \u2014 and illicit \u2014 view into the companies\u2019 dealings, the complaint alleges. (Hoffman stepped down from OpenAI\u2019s board in 2023.) Greylock invested in Inflection, Musk\u2019s counsel notes, the AI startup that Microsoft acqui-hired earlier this year \u2014 and which could reasonably be considered an OpenAI competitor, according to the complaint.\nAs for Templeton, who Microsoft briefly appointed a non-voting board observer at OpenAI, the amended filing alleges that she was in a position to facilitate agreements between Microsoft and OpenAI that would violate antitrust rules.\n\u201cThe purpose of the prohibition on interlocking directorates is to prevent sharing of competitively sensitive information in violation of antitrust laws and/or providing a forum for the coordination of other anticompetitive activity,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cAllowing Templeton and Hoffman to serve as members of OpenAI\u2019s \u2026. board undermined this purpose. \u201c\nPer the amended complaint, Zilis, who stepped down from OpenAI\u2019s board in 2023 after serving as a member for roughly four years, has standing as an \u201cinjured employee\u201d under California Corporations Code. Zilis repeatedly raised concerns over OpenAI\u2019s dealmaking internally that fell on deaf ears \u2014 concerns substantially similar to Musk\u2019s, according to the complaint.\nZilis has close ties to Musk, having worked as a project director at Tesla from 2017 to 2019 in addition to directing Neuralink research. She\u2019s also the mother of three of Musk\u2019s children.\nThe 107-page amended complaint includes the unusual detail that Altman proposed OpenAI sell its own cryptocurrency in September 2017 \u2014 a proposal Musk supposedly shot down.\nThe thrust of the lawsuit remains the same on the plaintiff side: that OpenAI profited from Musk\u2019s early involvement in the company yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. \u201cNo amount of clever drafting nor surveit of creative dealmaking can obscure what is happening here,\u201d reads the complaint. \u201cOpenAI, Inc., co-founded by Musk as an independent charity committed to safety and transparency \u2026 [is] fast becoming a full for-profit subsidiary of Microsoft.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon launches fixed pricing to treat hair loss, erectile dysfunction\ndescription2:\nAmazon on Thursday announced Prime members can access new fixed pricing for treatment of conditions like erectile dysfunction and men's hair loss, its latest effort to compete with other direct-to-consumer marketplaces such as Hims & Hers Health and Ro.\nShares of Hims & Hers closed down more than 24% on Thursday, the company's worst day on record.\nAmazon said in a blog post that Prime members can see the cost of a telehealth visit and their desired treatment before they decide to proceed with care for five common issues. Patients can access treatment for anti-aging skin care starting at $10 a month; motion sickness for $2 per use; erectile dysfunction at $19 a month; eyelash growth at $43 a month, and men's hair loss for $16 a month by using Amazon's savings benefit Prime Rx at checkout.\nAmazon acquired primary care provider One Medical for roughly $3.9 billion in July 2022, and Thursday's announcement builds on its existing pay-per-visit telehealth offering. Video visits through the service cost $49, and messaging visits cost $29 where available. Users can get treatment for more than 30 common conditions, including sinus infection and pink eye.\nMedications filled through Amazon Pharmacy are eligible for discounted pricing and will be delivered to patients' doors in standard Amazon packaging. Prime members will pay for the consultation and medication, but there are no additional fees, the blog post said.\nAnalysts at Bank of America downgraded shares of Hims & Hers from buy to underperform on Thursday, citing Amazon's push into hair loss and erectile dysfunction markets. The analysts said Hims & Hers generates more than 80% gross margins from its core erectile dysfunction and hair loss offerings, and estimate that Amazon's medications for those conditions are about 42% and 29% cheaper respectively.\nAs a result, the analysts said they think Amazon will limit the prices that Hims & Hers can charge and will hinder the company's ability to attract new customers.\n\"While Amazon may not offer the same personalized products, its wide net (we estimate 150MM Americans have Prime) creates a serious competitive threat for HIMS, in our view,\" they wrote in a Thursday note.\nAmazon has been trying to break into the lucrative health-care sector for years. The company launched its own online pharmacy in 2020 following its acquisition of PillPack in 2018. Amazon introduced, and later shuttered, a telehealth service called Amazon Care, as well as a line of health and wellness devices.\nThe company has also discontinued a secretive effort to develop an at-home fertility tracker, CNBC reported Wednesday.\n\u2014 CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report.\n\ntitle3:\nJapan is ramping up efforts to revive its once dominant chip industry\ndescription3:\nIn this article ASML\nASML-NL\nMU\nINTC\nSMSD-GB\n2330-TW Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nJapan is looking to revitalize its semiconductor industry. The Japanese government has unlocked billions of dollars in subsidies for its domestic chip sector. Thicha Studio | Istock | Getty Images\nJapan has announced a new plan to revitalize the country's semiconductor and artificial intelligence industries as it works to regain its chip leadership. The proposal will provide support worth 10 trillion yen ($65 billion) or more by fiscal 2030, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said earlier this week. \"We will formulate a new assistance framework to attract more than 50 trillion yen in public and private investment over the next 10 years,\" Ishiba said, adding it would be part of broader \"revitalization\" efforts in Japan. The plan will be part of a comprehensive economic package to be finalized in November and will be financed through subsidies, government institution investments and debt guarantees, according to local media. The move comes amid broader efforts by Japan to bolster and diversify its semiconductor supply chain, with the government aiming to triple sales of domestically produced chips to more than 15 trillion yen by 2030.\nDomestic chip hero?\nOne likely beneficiary of the funding announced Monday will be Japan-based Rapidus, a state-backed chip venture at the heart of the country's chip revitalization efforts. Founded in 2022 by the Japanese government, Rapidus has backing from a host of Japanese firms\u2014 including Toyota Motor and the Sony Group \u2014 and is collaborating with U.S. tech giant IBM. The company has already received over $2 billion in government support as it aims to mass-produce cutting-edge 2-nanometer logic chips by 2027. Logic chips are used to process information and complete tasks within electronic devices. The most advanced logic chips are used in technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and machine learning. Rapidus chairman Tetsuro Higashi has reportedly called the company Japan's \"last opportunity\" to regain a leading semiconductor position on the global stage as it looks to catch up with leaders like Taiwan and South Korea. In the 1980s, Japan was the world's dominant chip player and occupied more than half of the global semiconductor market. However, the country began losing its leading edge with the emergence of foreign competitors like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co ., now the world's dominant contract chip manufacturer, and South Korea's Samsung . Both Samsung and TSMC have laid out plans to begin commercial production of 2-nanometer chips by 2025. Meanwhile, the U.S. has become a key player in chip design, with companies like Intel and Micron , while the Netherlands makes the world's most advanced chip-making equipment through its company ASML .\nFeasibility\nThough it has lost its leadership in semiconductor production and manufacturing, Japan remains a leader in certain semiconductor materials and equipment, Michael Yang, senior director of semiconductors at analyst and consulting firm Omdia, told CNBC. Through its chip subsidies, which have mostly been geared toward increasing manufacturing capacity, the country should be able to expand into other aspects of the supply and enhance its position, Yang added. Still, regaining the chip market will be an uphill battle for Japan and will require Rapidus to find a \"shortcut\" in chip design and production to reach the level of advancement of leading semiconductor companies, said Brady Wang, semiconductor analyst at Counterpoint Research. Rapidus representatives have said that the architecture of the 2-nanometer chip is different from that of 3-nanometer ones, making mass production of the former a \"blank-slate challenge for all players,\" and presenting a prime opportunity to break into the market. However, in this endeavor, \"subsidies are a must-have, but cannot guarantee their success,\" Wang said, adding that it took TSMC over a decade to catch up to global chip firms and build relationships with customers. \"Subsidies are only a basic requirement for entering the semiconductor industry, but success requires more supportive measures, such as talent, technology, and strategic planning,\" said Ken Kuo, senior research vice president at tech market intelligence firm TrendForce.\nLearning from the best\n\ntitle4:\nX rival Bluesky gains 1.25 million users following U.S. election\ndescription4:\nIn this photo illustration, the Bluesky Social logo is displayed on a cell phone in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on September 4, 2024.\nMicro-blogging startup Bluesky has gained over 1.25 million new users in the past week, indicating some social media users are changing their habits following the U.S. presidential election.\nBluesky's influx of users shows that the app has been able to pitch itself as an alternative to X, formerly Twitter, which is owned by Elon Musk, as well as Meta's Threads. The bulk of the new users are coming from the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom, the company said Wednesday.\n\"We're excited to welcome everyone looking for a better social media experience,\" Bluesky CEO Jay Graber told CNBC in a statement.\nDespite the surge of users, Bluesky's total base remains a fraction of its rivals.' The Seattle startup claims 15.2 million total users. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in October said Threads had nearly 275 million monthly users. Musk in May claimed that X had 600 million monthly users, but market intelligence firm Sensor Tower pegged X's monthly base at 318 million users in October.\nCreated in 2019 as a project inside Twitter, when Jack Dorsey was still CEO, Bluesky doesn't show ads and has yet to develop a business model. It became an independent company in 2021. Dorsey said in May of this year that he's no longer a member of Bluesky's board.\n\"Journalists, politicians, and news junkies have also been talking up Bluesky as a better X alternative than Threads,\" wrote Similarweb, the internet traffic and monitoring service, in a Tuesday blog.\nSome users with new Bluesky accounts posted that they had moved to the service due to Musk and his support for President-elect Donald Trump.\n\"It's appalling that Elon Musk has transformed Twitter into a Trump propaganda machine, rife with disinformation and misinformation,\" one user posted on Bluesky.\nThis is Bluesky's second notable surge in the last couple of months.\nBluesky said it picked up 2 million new users in September after the Brazilian Supreme Court suspended X in the country for failing to comply with regional content moderation policies and not appointing a local representative.\nWatch: Cramer's Mad Dash: Alphabet and Meta.\"\n\nResponse:",
