    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday April 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nJudge rules Google illegally monopolized adtech, opening door to potential breakup\ndescription0:\nA federal judge has found that Google violated antitrust laws by \u201cwillfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power\u201d in the advertising technology market, rounding out a two-year saga after the U.S. and eight states filed its initial complaints against the Alphabet-owned company.\nThe court will set a briefing schedule and hearing date to determine appropriate remedies for the antitrust violations, per a Thursday filing.\nThe remedies could include forcing Google to break up its advertising business, like selling its Google Ad Manager, which includes the AdX ad exchange and DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers), the ad server used for publishers.\nOr the courts could force behavioral remedies that would allow Google to keep its business intact, but would impose restrictions to ensure fair competition, like prohibiting Google from prioritizing its own exchange or demand in auctions.\nIn a separate antitrust case, another federal judge last year found that Google illegally monopolized the general internet search market. The judge has not yet issued remedies on that case, but is expected to do so in mid-2025.\nIn the adtech case, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema wrote in her memorandum opinion that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the \u201copen-web display advertiser ad networks\u201d are a relevant market where Google has monopoly power. These networks help advertisers buy display ads across the open web, so they\u2019re outside of closed ecosystems like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Search.\nThe judge did agree that Google violated the Sherman Act by monopolizing and unlawfully tying two parts of the adtech stack together, specifically DFP and AdX, and that Google is guilty of abuse of monopoly power in the publisher-side adtech.\n\u201cWe won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google\u2019s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don\u2019t harm competition. We disagree with the Court\u2019s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice \u2013 alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia \u2013 filed suit against Google\u2019s alleged use of monopoly power over the digital ad market in January 2023.\nThe DOJ argued that Google achieved its monopoly through anti-competitive conduct when it purchased DoubleClick in 2008, which then became the backbone of its ad business. Google then bought AdMeld in 2011 to gain more control over the ad market\u2019s supply side. The government says this allowed Google to hike up ad prices and harm publishers by taking larger cuts of each sale.\nThe trial for this case began in September 2024 and lasted for three weeks, with closing arguments presented in late November.\nThis article has been updated to include more background about the case.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI pursued Cursor maker before entering into talks to buy Windsurf for $3B\ndescription1:\nWhen news broke that OpenAI was in talks to acquire AI coding company Windsurf for $3 billion, one of the first questions on the mind of anyone following the space was likely: \u201cWhy not buy Cursor creator Anysphere instead?\u201d\nAfter all, OpenAI Startup Fund has been an investor in Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, since the quickly-growing coding assistant\u2019s seed round in late 2023. (Anysphere is often referred to by its product name, Cursor.) It turns out that OpenAI indeed approached Anysphere in 2024 and again earlier this year about a potential acquisition, according to a report from CNBC. The talks failed. Instead, Anysphere has been in talks to raise capital at about $10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.\nOpenAI\u2019s desire to move on to acquisition discussions with another coding assistant maker signals how important capturing a slice of the code generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker. Windsurf is generating about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), TechCrunch reported in February. Meanwhile, Anysphere\u2019s Cursor reportedly makes about $200 million on an ARR basis.\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s Codex CLI \u201cagent,\u201d which the company released Wednesday, can also write and edit code, its attempt to buy Windsurf suggests the company doesn\u2019t want to wait for CLI to gain traction with customers.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI launches Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks\ndescription2:\nIn a bid to more aggressively compete with rival AI companies like Google, OpenAI is launching Flex processing, an API option that provides lower AI model usage prices in exchange for slower response times and \u201coccasional resource unavailability.\u201d\nFlex processing, which is available in beta for OpenAI\u2019s recently released o3 and o4-mini reasoning models, is aimed at lower-priority and \u201cnon-production\u201d tasks such as model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads, OpenAI says.\nIt reduces API costs by exactly half. For o3, Flex processing is $5/M input tokens (~750,000 words) and $20/M output tokens versus the standard $10/M input tokens and $40/M output tokens. For o4-mini, Flex brings the price down to $0.55/M input tokens and $2.20/M output tokens from $1.10/M input tokens and $4.40/M output tokens.\nThe launch of Flex processing comes as the price of frontier AI continues to climb, and as rivals release cheaper, more efficient budget-oriented models. On Thursday, Google rolled out Gemini 2.5 Flash, a reasoning model that matches or bests DeepSeek\u2019s R1 in terms of performance at a lower input token cost.\nIn an email to customers announcing the launch of Flex pricing, OpenAI also indicated that developers in tiers 1-3 of its usage tiers hierarchy will have to complete the newly introduced ID verification process to access o3. (Tiers are determined by the amount of money spent on OpenAI services.) O3\u2019s \u2014 and other models\u2019 \u2014reasoning summaries and streaming API support are also gated behind verification.\nOpenAI previously said ID verification is intended to stop bad actors from violating its usage policies.\n\ntitle4:\nDefense tech Theseus landed Y Combinator, the US Special Forces, and $4.3M from a tweet\ndescription4:\nOn February 18, 2024, Ian Laffey posted on X that he and two others he\u2019d just met built a cheap drone at a hackathon that calculated its coordinates simply by using its camera and Google Maps. He and his colleagues, Sacha L\u00e9vy and Carl Schoeller, were all engineers under the age of 25.\nwe designed, 3d printed and built a <$500 drone with that calculates GPS coordinates without a signal using a camera + google maps\nin 24h pic.twitter.com/8P2QoQMNbW \u2014 Ian Laffey (@ilaffey2) February 18, 2024\nThe tech had clear potential to combat rampant GPS jamming of drones in Ukraine. Instead of GPS, drone operators there have to use high-tech goggles to guide their drones by sight. But that leads to lots of problems, especially under poor conditions like thick fog or at night.\nAt the end of the hackathon, Schoeller wished his two teammates well and parted, hoping their paths might cross again.\nBut the tweet went viral and changed their lives. A day later, the three decided to apply to Y Combinator, successfully getting into its Spring 2024 cohort.\nNow, their San Francisco-based company, Theseus, has just raised $4.3 million in seed funding in a round led by First Round Capital, with additional backing from Y Combinator and Lux Capital, it exclusively told TechCrunch.\nTheseus joins a flock of other drone-related startups. There\u2019s Skydio, which focuses on replacing Chinese drones for U.S. law enforcement and was last valued at $2.2 billion in 2023. Shield AI, which builds reconnaissance drones, recently raised at a $5.3 billion valuation. The biggest defense tech player, Anduril, launched its own small drone last year, and is reportedly in talks to raise at a $28 billion valuation.\nA drone at a us special forces base using theseus Image Credits:Theseus\nTheseus says it doesn\u2019t build drones, but focuses on the hardware components and software that will enable pretty much any military drone to fly unmanned without GPS. Schoeller, Theseus\u2019 CEO, told TechCrunch the company doesn\u2019t build targeting systems. Its software is not deciding whether a certain spot is a legitimate military target or not \u2014 the sole focus is getting a drone from point A to B.\nTheseus hasn\u2019t won any U.S. military deals yet, and hasn\u2019t been deployed in an actual battlefield. So it\u2019s using its fresh capital to focus on further building out its tech, hiring for three engineering roles.\nHowever, the viral hackathon tweet did get Theseus noticed by U.S. Special Forces, which has entered into an agreement for early testing and development. Theseus says it recently went to a secret Special Forces base to test out its latest system, sending TechCrunch a photo of it in action.\nOverall, starting a company with people you\u2019ve known for under a week \u201cgenerally isn\u2019t advised,\u201d but in Theseus\u2019 case, it warranted the leap of faith, Schoeller wrote on LinkedIn.\"\n\nResponse:",
