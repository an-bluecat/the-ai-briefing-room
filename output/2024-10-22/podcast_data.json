Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay process about 87% of UPI transactions, whereas Paytm\u2019s market share has shrunk from 13% to 8% after this year\u2019s central bank restrictions.\nThe Reserve Bank of India ordered Paytm to cease many of the businesses at its affiliate payments bank early this year over repeated violation of rules. NPCI, the regulatory body that oversees UPI, approved Paytm\u2019s application on Tuesday.\nAnalysts at Bernstein and Goldman Sachs said the approval is a \u201csignificant\u201d development that will help revive Paytm\u2019s transacting user growth. Paytm\u2019s monthly transacting users has fallen to 68 million as of last month from 100 million in December.\nPaytm on Tuesday reported revenue of $197.4 million in the quarter ending September, up from $178.6 million in the previous quarter but down 34% year-on-year from $299.5 million. Profit in the quarter climbed to $110 million after factoring in a one-time gain of $160 million from the sale of entertainment ticketing biz to Zomato.\n\ntitle1:\nAnthropic announces AI agents for complex tasks, racing OpenAI\ndescription1:\nAnthropic, the Amazon-backed AI startup founded by former OpenAI research executives, announced Tuesday that it's reached an artificial intelligence milestone for the company: AI agents that can use a computer to complete complex tasks like a human would.\nAnthropic is the company behind Claude \u2014 one of the chatbots that, like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini, has exploded in popularity. Startups like Anthropic, alongside tech giants such as Google , Amazon , Microsoft and Meta, are all part of a generative AI arms race to ensure they don't fall behind in a market predicted to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\nAnthropic's new Computer Use capability, part of its two newest AI models, allows its tech to interpret what's on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing.\nThe tool can \"use computers in basically the same way that we do,\" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview, adding it can do tasks with \"tens or even hundreds of steps.\"\nAmazon had early access to the tool, Anthropic told CNBC, and early customers and beta testers included Asana, Canva and Notion. The company has been working on the tool since early this year, according to Kaplan.\nAnthropic released the feature Tuesday in public beta for developers. The team hopes to open up use to consumers and enterprise clients over the next few months, or early next year, per Kaplan.\nAnthropic said that future consumer applications include booking flights, scheduling appointments, filling out forms, conducting online research and filing expense reports.\n\"We want Claude to be able to actually assist people with all sorts of different kinds of work, and we think the chatbot setup is fairly limited because you can ask a question and [get] context but it stops there,\" Kaplan told CNBC.\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft and OpenAI are giving news outlets $10 million to use AI tools\ndescription2:\nMicrosoft and OpenAI announced they\u2019re offering a select group of media outlets up to $10 million ($2.5 million in cash plus $2.5 million worth of \u201csoftware and enterprise credits\u201d from each) to try out AI tools in the newsroom.\nThe first round of funding will go to Newsday, The Minnesota Star Tribune, The Philadelphia Inquirer, Chicago Public Media, and The Seattle Times.\nThese outlets will receive a grant to hire a two-year fellow who will work to develop and implement AI tools using Microsoft Azure and OpenAI credits. The program is part of a collaboration between Microsoft, OpenAI, and the Lenfest Institute for Journalism, which aims to promote local media.\n\u201cWhile nothing will replace the central role of reporters, we believe that AI technology can help in the research, investigation, distribution, and monetization of important journalism,\u201d Tom Rubin, the chief of intellectual property and content at OpenAI, said in the press release.\n\ntitle3:\nAir taxis and other electric-powered aircraft cleared for takeoff with final FAA rules\ndescription3:\nThe Federal Aviation Administration published highly anticipated final regulations for electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles that it says will chart the path for the \u201cair travel of the future.\u201d\nThe FAA says these \u201cpowered-lift\u201d vehicles will be the first completely new category of aircraft since helicopters were introduced in 1940. These aircraft will be used for a variety of services, including air taxis, cargo delivery, and rescue and retrieval operations. The final rules published today contain guidelines for pilot training as well as operational requirements regarding minimum safe altitudes and visibility.\n\u201cPowered lift aircraft are the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years,\u201d FAA administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement. \u201cThis historic rule will pave the way for accommodating wide-scale Advanced Air Mobility operations in the future.\u201d\n\u201cPowered lift aircraft are the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years.\u201d\nPowered lift includes aircraft described by industry watchers as electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL. Using tilt rotors, eVTOL aircraft are designed to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then transition into forward flight on fixed wings like a plane.\nNumerous startups, including Joby Aviation, Archer, and Wisk, are planning on launching commercial air taxi services with these new types of aircraft in the next few years. And for years, the FAA has promised there would be a regulatory pathway for powered-lift designs certified under Part 23 as normal aircraft.\nBut, in 2022, the agency changed course, determining instead that the aircraft would need to obtain Part 21 certification for special class vehicles. That kicked off a yearslong process to develop an entirely new set of rules for training, operations, maintenance, and more.\nThe rules that were eventually introduced last year were panned by industry groups as too strict. They called for performance-based operational rules, rather than the creation of a new powered-lift category, as proposed by the FAA. The agency argues its newly finalized rules should address those concerns, while also maintaining the safety and rigor the industry is known for. Earlier this year, Congress gave the FAA more sway in regulating these new types of aircraft.\nPhoto by GIUSEPPE CACACE/AFP via Getty Images\n\u201cThe FAA will continue to prioritize the safety of our system as we work to seamlessly integrate innovative technology and operations,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cThis final rule provides the necessary framework to allow powered lift aircraft to safely operate in our airspace.\u201d\nBased on the final rules, it would appear that the FAA took those criticisms to heart. A new pilot training and qualifications rule was needed because \u201cexisting regulations did not address this new category of aircraft, which can take off and land vertically like a helicopter and fly like an airplane during cruise flight,\u201d the FAA said. The rule also provides a \u201ccomprehensive framework\u201d for certifying the initial group of powered-lift instructors and pilots.\nAccording to the agency, the rule would:\nMakes changes to numerous existing regulations and establishes a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) with new requirements to facilitate instructor and pilot certification and training. Applies helicopter operating requirements to some phases of flight and adopts a performance-based approach to certain operating rules. Allows pilots to train in powered-lift with a single set of flight controls; legacy rules require two flight controls \u2013 one for the student and one for the instructor.\nThere are no powered-lift aircraft in commercial operation in the US, as it takes years for companies to obtain the necessary certificates from the FAA. Several companies are well on their way, including Archer and Joby. The latter released a statement praising the FAA for releasing the final rules ahead of schedule.\n\ntitle4:\nOpenAI hires its first chief economist\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI has hired its first chief economist: Aaron Chatterji, formerly the chief economist at the Commerce Department under President Joe Biden and a senior economist in President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\nChatterji, who\u2019s also a professor of business and public policy at Duke, will study AI\u2019s economic impacts at OpenAI, leading research into how AI might influence economic growth and job prospects.\nNotably, Chatterji helped to coordinate the Biden administration\u2019s implementation of the 2022 CHIPS Act, which authorized roughly $280 billion in funding for the development of computer chips in the U.S. His understanding of the project \u2014 and political connections \u2014 could help OpenAI as it undertakes chip design efforts of its own.\nChatterji wasn\u2019t OpenAI\u2019s only high-profile hire today. The company also appointed Scott Schools, former associate deputy attorney general and Uber\u2019s compliance head, as its new chief compliance officer. He\u2019ll work with OpenAI\u2019s board and teams across the company on legal requirements and ethics, OpenAI said.\"\n\nResponse:",
