Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The ChatGPT-maker on Monday said it has reached a deal with Amazon to buy $38 billion in cloud computing services over the next seven years.\nOpenAI said it will immediately start using AWS compute, with all capacity targeted to be deployed before the end of 2026, with the ability to expand further into 2027 and beyond.\nThe deal follows OpenAI\u2019s restructuring last week, which freed the company from having to secure Microsoft\u2019s approval to buy computing services from other firms.\nOpenAI\u2019s deal with Amazon is part of its larger mission to grow computing power, spending more than $1 trillion over the next decade. The company has announced new data center buildouts with Oracle, SoftBank, the United Arab Emirates, and others. OpenAI has also secured deals with chipmakers Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom.\nTo some analysts, the increased investment form OpenAI and other tech giants signals that the industry is heading toward an AI bubble, wherein massive sums are spent beefing out an unproven, and potentially dangerous, technology with no clear sign of a meaningful return on investment.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft inks $9.7B deal with Australia's IREN for AI cloud capacity\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft is leaving no stone unturned in its quest to secure more compute capacity for meeting its customers\u2019 heavy demand for AI services.\nOn Monday, the Redmond-based tech giant signed a $9.7 billion, five-year contract with Australia\u2019s IREN to secure further AI cloud capacity. The deal will give Microsoft access to compute infrastructure built with Nvidia\u2019s GB300 GPUs, which will be deployed over phases through 2026 at IREN\u2019s facility in Childress, Texas, planned to support 750 megawatts of capacity.\nIREN said it is separately buying GPUs and equipment from Dell for about $5.8 billion.\nThe deal comes after Microsoft last month launched its first production cluster with Nvidia\u2019s GB300 NVL72 systems for Azure, which, the company said, are optimized for reasoning models, agentic AI systems, and multimodal generative AI.\nLast month, Microsoft signed a deal with Nscale for approximately 200,000 Nvidia GB300 GPUs to three data centers in Europe and one in the U.S.\nSimilar to competitors like CoreWeave, IREN started off as a bitcoin-mining operation but quickly realized that its massive collection of GPUs was better put to use for AI workloads. The company has benefited massively from the shift in focus. The company\u2019s CEO, Daniel Roberts, expects the Microsoft deal to take up only 10% of the company\u2019s total capacity and generate about $1.94 billion in annualized revenue, Bloomberg reported.\n\ntitle3:\nApple's App Store gets a new web interface\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nApple has redesigned the web interface for its App Store, making it actually usable for people who aren\u2019t viewing the store on Apple devices.\nBefore this update, users could see individual pages for apps on the web \u2014 which they probably found via a search engine \u2014 but there was no way to browse within the App Store. On a MacBook, navigating to an app\u2019s iOS store page in the browser would prompt the native App Store software to launch. But on non-Apple hardware, this would lead you to a dead end.\nThe new interface allows users to browse apps by category and by platform \u2014 there are separate sections for apps on the iPhone, iPad, Watch, and other devices. While users cannot currently download apps from the web, this functionality could possibly be added in later.\nAdmittedly, the subset of people who are trying to learn more about iOS apps from a Microsoft device, for example, is likely a small one \u2014 perhaps this would be useful to app developers or researchers working on products in both the iOS and Google ecosystems.\nThis redesign also signifies Apple\u2019s continued push to portray itself as a more open ecosystem. For years, governments around the world have lodged complaints against Apple, accusing the company of acting as a monopoly to discourage competition \u2014 any step Apple takes to make its products more accessible beyond its own ecosystem is relevant to those ongoing legal battles.\n\ntitle4:\nAltman and Nadella need more power for AI, but they\u2019re not sure how much\ndescription4:\nHow much power is enough for AI? Nobody knows, not even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman or Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\nThat has put software-first businesses like OpenAI and Microsoft in a bind. Much of the tech world has been focused on compute as a major barrier to AI deployment. And while tech companies have been racing to secure power, those efforts have lagged GPU purchases to the point where Microsoft has apparently ordered too many chips for the amount of power it has contracted.\n\u201cThe cycles of demand and supply in this particular case you can\u2019t really predict,\u201d Nadella said on the BG2 podcast. \u201cThe biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it\u2019s a power and it\u2019s sort of the ability to get the [data center] builds done fast enough close to power.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can\u2019t plug in. In fact, that is my problem today. It\u2019s not a supply issue of chips; it\u2019s the fact that I don\u2019t have warm shells to plug into,\u201d Nadella added, referring to the commercial real estate term for buildings ready for tenants.\nIn some ways, we\u2019re seeing what happens when companies accustomed to dealing with silicon and code, two technologies that scale and deploy quickly compared with massive power plants, need to ramp up their efforts in the energy world.\nFor more than a decade, electricity demand in the U.S. was flat. But over the last five years, demand from data centers has begun to ramp up, outpacing utilities\u2019 plans for new generating capacity. That has led data center developers to add power in so-called behind-the-meter arrangements, where electricity is fed directly to the data center, skipping the grid.\nAltman, who was also on the podcast, thinks that trouble could be brewing: \u201cIf a very cheap form of energy comes online soon at mass scale, then a lot of people are going to be extremely burned with existing contracts they\u2019ve signed.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cIf we can continue this unbelievable reduction in cost per unit of intelligence \u2014 let\u2019s say it\u2019s been averaging like 40x for a given level per year \u2014 you know, that\u2019s like a very scary exponent from an infrastructure buildout standpoint,\u201d he said.\nAltman has invested in nuclear energy, including fission startup Oklo and fusion startup Helion, along with Exowatt, a solar startup that concentrates the sun\u2019s heat and stores it for later use.\nNone of those are ready for widespread deployment today, though, and fossil-based technologies like natural gas power plants take years to build. Plus, orders placed today for new gas turbine likely won\u2019t get fulfilled until later this decade.\nThat\u2019s partially why tech companies have been adding solar at a rapid clip, drawn to the technology\u2019s inexpensive cost, emissions-free power, and ability to deploy rapidly.\nThere might be subconscious factors at play, too. Photovoltaic solar is in many ways a parallel technology to semiconductors, and one that has been de-risked and commoditized. Both PV solar and semiconductors are built on silicon substrates, and both roll off production lines as modular components that can be packaged together and tied into parallel arrays that make the completed part more powerful than any individual module.\nBecause of solar\u2019s modularity and speed of deployment, the pace of construction is much closer to that of a data center.\nBut both still take time to build, and demand can change much more quickly than either a data center or solar project can be completed. Altman admitted that if AI gets more efficient or if demand doesn\u2019t grow as he expects, some companies might be saddled with idled power plants.\nBut from his other comments, he doesn\u2019t seem to think that\u2019s likely. Instead, he appears to be a firm believer in Jevons paradox, which says that more efficient use of a resource will lead to greater use, increasing overall demand.\n\u201cIf the price of compute per like unit of intelligence or whatever \u2014 however you want to think about it \u2014 fell by a factor of a 100 tomorrow, you would see usage go up by much more than 100 and there\u2019d be a lot of things that people would love to do with that compute that just make no economic sense at the current cost,\u201d Altman said.\"\n\nResponse:",
