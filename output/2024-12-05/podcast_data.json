Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

This helps them avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models, with the downside being that they often take longer to arrive at solutions. O1 reasons through tasks, planning ahead and performing a series of actions that help the model tease out answers.\nOpenAI released a preview of o1 in September, but this new version is, generally speaking, more performant. Compared to the preview, users can expect \u201ca faster, more powerful, and accurate reasoning model that is even better at coding and math,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nAdditionally, o1 can reason about image uploads now (this wasn\u2019t possible during the preview), and has been trained to be \u201cmore concise in its thinking\u201d to improve response times. According to OpenAI\u2019s internal testing, o1 reduces \u201cmajor errors\u201d on \u201cdifficult real-world questions\u201d by 34% compared to the preview version.\nOddly enough, though, the full o1 performs worse than the preview version on a number of common benchmarks. One of those benchmarks is MLE-Bench, which measures how well AI \u201cagents\u201d perform at machine learning engineering.\nO1 doesn\u2019t require a ChatGPT Pro subscription. As of this afternoon, all paid ChatGPT users can access o1 through the ChatGPT model selector tool.\nBut ChatGPT Pro subscribers will get an ostensibly better version of o1 than users who don\u2019t shell out as much. Called o1 pro mode, it \u201cuses more compute for the best answers to the hardest questions,\u201d OpenAI says.\nChatGPT Pro users can access the functionality by selecting \u201co1 pro mode\u201d in the model picker and asking a question directly. Since answers will take longer to generate, ChatGPT will display a progress bar and send an in-app notification if they switch away to another conversation.\nO1 pro mode may simply up the \u201creasoning\u201d time the model takes before it responds with an answer. In its o1 preview announcement, OpenAI said that it aimed to experiment with o1 models that reason for hours, days, or even weeks to further boost their reasoning capabilities, and this could well be a step toward that direction.\n\u201cIn evaluations from external expert testers, o1 pro mode produces more reliably accurate and comprehensive responses, especially in areas like data science, programming, and case law analysis,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cCompared to both o1 and o1-preview, o1 pro mode performs better on challenging machine learning benchmarks across math, science, and coding. In particular, we saw a 75% reduction in errors for easier coding competition questions more reflective of everyday programming queries.\u201d\nO1 will soon be available in OpenAI\u2019s API, as well, with new capabilities including function calling (i.e. the ability to use outside tools) and image analysis. OpenAI says that it plans to add support for web browsing, file uploads, and more in the months ahead.\nChatGPT Pro is easily OpenAI\u2019s priciest plan yet \u2014 and 10x the cost of ChatGPT Plus. It\u2019s likely to be a tough sell to all but the most devoted users, considering many people already think ChatGPT Plus is too expensive.\nTo sweeten the pot, ChatGPT Pro also includes unlimited access to GPT-4o and Advanced Voice Mode, ChatGPT\u2019s human-like conversational feature.\nOpenAI will also give some subscriptions away for free. The company announced a program to award 10 grants of ChatGPT Pro to medical researchers at \u201cleading institutions,\u201d with plans for additional grants across \u201cvarious disciplines\u201d in the future.\nPrice hikes for the premium ChatGPT have long been rumored. OpenAI expects to charge $44 per month for ChatGPT Plus by 2029, according to reporting by The New York Times. The company has also toyed with the idea of ultra-costly business subscriptions with additional functionality and access to models under development, per The Information. Today\u2019s news certainly supports those reports.\nThe aggressive moves reflect pressure on OpenAI from investors to narrow its losses. While the company\u2019s monthly revenue reached $300 million in August, according to The New York Times, OpenAI expects to lose roughly $5 billion this year. Expenditures like staffing, office rent, and AI training infrastructure are to blame. ChatGPT alone was at one point reportedly costing OpenAI $700,000 per day.\nChatGPT remains one of OpenAI\u2019s biggest revenue sources. The platform has over 300 million weekly active users, around 10 million of whom are paying subscribers.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

The backstory here is that after the country required smartphones which are sold domestically to be made of at least 40% locally manufactured parts, Indonesia banned iPhone 16 sales. In November 2024, authorities even confiscated and destroyed recent iPhone models, as shown in the picture above.\nNow, Reuters reports that Apple plans to spend $1 billion on its first manufacturing plant in Indonesia. The factory will produce smartphone components and other parts for Apple products.\nWhile the move follows Indonesia\u2019s crackdown on foreign production, it fits a trend as over the past few years Apple has diversified its supply chain to reduce reliance on China. For instance, the iPhone 16 is currently manufactured in Brazil and India, as well as China. Many AirPods models are also assembled in Vietnam.\n\ntitle2:\nWaymo announces robotaxi expansion to Miami\ndescription2:\nWaymo is setting its sights on its next location: the Sunshine State.\nThe Alphabet -owned company announced Thursday that it will be hitting the roads in Miami. Waymo said it will first begin cruising through the Florida city with human safety drivers in 2025 before opening doors to riders for its robotaxi service through its Waymo One app in 2026.\nThe expansion into Miami is indicative of Waymo's growing confidence in operating its self-driving vehicles in harsher weather conditions in large metropolitan areas in the U.S.\nWaymo first tested in Miami in 2019, which the company said helped improve the ability of its self-driving vehicles to navigate in wet and rainy conditions.\n\"We deepened our learning and understanding of the Waymo Driver's performance in adverse weather conditions,\" a company spokesperson said.\nWaymo will use what it learned when it returns to the city with its all-electric Jaguar I-PACEs next year.\nThe company said its initial territory in Florida will include some parts of Miami's larger metropolitan area, which has a population of more than 6 million people.\nWaymo has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.\nIn November, the company announced it was removing its waitlist of about 300,000 people in Los Angeles, so anyone would be able to use Waymo One to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout the nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County. The company's ride-hailing service also operates citywide in Phoenix and San Francisco.\nAnd in September, Waymo announced a partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta. Through that deal, Uber riders will be able to access Waymo's robotaxis through the Uber app starting in early 2025, and Uber will be responsible for fleet management and operations of the Waymo vehicles, including maintenance and infrastructure, such as vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs.\nAdditionally, Waymo on Thursday announced that it will partner with mobility company Moove to manage its fleet operations, facilities and charging infrastructure in both Miami and Phoenix. Moove will begin managing Waymo's Phoenix fleet in early 2025, a Waymo spokesperson said.\nWaymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture's parent company, Alphabet, which also owns Google, led the funding round alongside earlier backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.\nThe robotaxi company said it now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week via the Waymo One app across San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles.\nWaymo is the only autonomous vehicle developer that currently operates a commercial robotaxi service in several major metro areas across the U.S., but competitors are looming.\nGM-owned Cruise is working on bringing its autonomous vehicles back into use on public roads after discontinuing its services following an accident where one of its self-driving cars injured a pedestrian in San Francisco.\nTesla, meanwhile, showed off design concepts for a self-driving Cybercab and Robovan at an event in October. However, Tesla still classifies the Autopilot and Full Self-Driving software in its vehicles as \"partially automated driving systems,\" which require a human to be ready to steer or brake at all times. In an October earnings call, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in California and Texas as early as 2025.\nSoftBank-funded Wayve is testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, and Amazon -owned Zoox is also testing its self-driving cars, which do not feature steering wheels, in several U.S. cities.\nWATCH: Waymo could benefit big from eased self-driving rules\n\ntitle3:\nIntel adds two new directors with CEO search underway\ndescription3:\nThe logo of Intel is seen during Computex 2024 in Taipei, Taiwan, June 4, 2024.\nIntel on Thursday announced the appointment of two new directors with significant semiconductor manufacturing experience as the company ramps up the search process for ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger's replacement.\nFormer ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip Technology interim CEO Steve Sanghi will join Intel's board effective immediately, the company said. Their appointments mean that Intel's board once again has directors with semiconductor experience, fixing a vacuum left by the departure of Cadence Design Systems Chairman Lip-Bu Tan in August.\nIntel declined to comment on what committees the two new directors would join and the nature of the search process.\nIntel's search for new directors predated Gelsinger's firing, according to people familiar with the matter. The company's board had been interviewing semiconductor executives for several weeks, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential information freely.\nMeurice ran ASML, which manufactures some of the most advanced chipmaking machines, for eight years. ASML's share price quintupled during his tenure, Intel said.\nSanghi rejoined Microchip as interim CEO in November, after serving as CEO from 1991 to 2016. Sanghi was previously an executive at Intel.\n\"Eric and Steve are highly respected leaders in the semiconductor industry whose deep technical expertise, executive experience and operational rigor make them great additions to the Intel board,\" interim Executive Chairman Frank Yeary said.\nSanghi and Meurice join Intel's board at a critical juncture. The company ousted Gelsinger over the weekend and has since been assembling a short list of replacements with the help of an executive search firm. Intel's market cap sits firmly below $100 billion, and the company is still in the middle of an intense cost-cutting drive.\nIntel CFO David Zinsner and product chief MJ Holthaus currently serve as interim co-CEOs.\n\ntitle4:\nEx-PayPal COO David Sacks is Trump's new crypto and AI 'czar'\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nIncoming President Donald Trump has a new crypto and AI \u201cczar\u201d: ex-PayPal COO David Sacks.\nTrump announced Sacks\u2019 appointment Thursday in a post on Truth Social, Trump\u2019s social networking platform. \u201c[Sacks] will work on a legal framework so the Crypto [sic] industry has the clarity it has been asking for, and can thrive in the US,\u201d he wrote.\nSacks, a member of the so-called \u201cPayPal Mafia,\u201d is a co-founder of Yammer, the internal communications tool that Microsoft acquired for $1.2 billion in 2012. He\u2019s also behind Craft Ventures, a VC fund that has backed startups including SpaceX, Reddit, and ClickUp.\nIn an interview with CNBC in 2017, Sacks said he believed that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum fulfill the \u201coriginal vision\u201d of PayPal: creating a \u201cdatabase of money\u201d in which payments never leave the system.\nSacks\u2019 views on AI and AI policymaking are less obvious, though his policies generally are decidedly right-leaning and deregulatory, which could well mean a lighter touch than the outgoing Biden administration favored.\"\n\nResponse:",
