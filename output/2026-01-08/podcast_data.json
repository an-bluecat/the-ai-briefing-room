Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

On Thursday, it announced a $400 million Series F funding round at a $9 billion valuation. The New York-based outfit has now raised over $1.7 billion. This funding comes just six months after the previous $540 million round at a $6 billion valuation.\nThe new round was led by funds managed by Blackstone with participation from existing investors including Accel, Coatue, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Sapphire, Sequoia, and others.\nCyera offers what it calls data security posture management, a service that helps companies map out where all their sensitive data lives across cloud systems and databases, track how employees and applications use it, and identify security vulnerabilities. The rise of AI \u2014 which has increased both the volume of data that companies handle and concerns about data leaks \u2014 has helped Cyera sign up one-fifth of the Fortune 500 companies as customers and more than triple revenue in its last year, the company says, causing investors to eagerly pile in.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI to acquire the team behind executive coaching AI tool Convogo\ndescription1:\nOpenAI is kicking off the new year with yet another acqui-hire. The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo\u2019s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its \u201cAI cloud efforts.\u201d The three co-founders \u2014 Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett \u2014 will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.\nConvogo\u2019s product will be wound down.\nThe startup began as a \u201cweekend hackathon\u201d sparked by a question by Cooper\u2019s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped \u201cthousands\u201d of coaches and partnered with the \u201cworld\u2019s top leadership development firms,\u201d per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.\nIn the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we\u2019ve built for coaches at Convogo,\u201d the founders wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.\u201d\nThe Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI\u2019s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI\u2019s ecosystem \u2014 as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm \u2014 or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The main exception to that rule is OpenAI\u2019s acquisition of Jonny Ive\u2019s io Products, which is continuing its product roadmap as the two companies work together to create a piece of AI hardware.\n\ntitle2:\nNvidia's reportedly asking Chinese customers to pay upfront for its H200 AI chips\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nNvidia is now requiring its customers in China to pay upfront in full for its H200 AI chips even as approval stateside and from Beijing remains uncertain, Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources.\nThe chipmaker isn\u2019t leaving any room for refunds or changes to orders, the report said.\nWhile some customers may be allowed to use commercial insurance or asset collateral, the terms are far stricter than Nvidia\u2019s earlier policies, which sometimes permitted partial deposits, Reuters reported.\nNvidia declined to comment.\nChina is expected to allow Nvidia to sell its H200 chips in the country, per Bloomberg, though Beijing wants to prevent the chips from being used by its military, state-owned firms, and sensitive infrastructure concerns.\nDespite the challenges, demand for Nvidia\u2019s H200 remains strong, and Chinese companies have reportedly placed orders for more than 2 million of the GPUs in 2026, prompting the chipmaker to ramp up production.\nNvidia is trying to strike a careful balance between meeting strong demand for its chips while managing political risk in both the U.S. and China. The U.S. chipmaker suffered costly setbacks when the Trump administration said it would need a license to export its H20 chips to China, forcing the company to write down $5.5 billion worth of inventory.\n\ntitle3:\nData security startup Cyera hits $9B valuation six months after being valued at $6B\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nData security startup Cyera continues on a growth tear. On Thursday, it announced a $400 million Series F funding round at a $9 billion valuation. The New York-based outfit has now raised over $1.7 billion. This funding comes just six months after the previous $540 million round at a $6 billion valuation.\nThe new round was led by funds managed by Blackstone with participation from existing investors including Accel, Coatue, Lightspeed, Redpoint, Sapphire, Sequoia, and others.\nCyera offers what it calls data security posture management, a service that helps companies map out where all their sensitive data lives across cloud systems and databases, track how employees and applications use it, and identify security vulnerabilities.

While the report contains promises to respect human rights and have controls to demand its customers do the same, the report provides no concrete evidence supporting either.\nExperts and critics who have followed NSO and the spyware market for years believe the report is part of an effort and campaign by the company to get the U.S. government to remove the company from a blocklist \u2014 technically called the Entity List \u2014 as it hopes to enter the U.S. market with new financial backers and executives at the helm.\nLast year, a group of U.S. investors acquired the company, and since then, NSO has been undergoing a transition that included high-profile personnel changes: former Trump official David Friedman was appointed the new executive chairman; CEO Yaron Shohat stepped down; and Omri Lavie, the last remaining founder who was still involved in the company, also left, as Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported.\n\u201cWhen NSO\u2019s products are in the right hands within the right countries, the world is a far safer place. That will always be our overriding mission,\u201d Friedman wrote in the report, which does not mention any country where NSO operates.\nNatalia Krapiva, the senior tech-legal counsel at Access Now, a digital rights organization that investigates spyware abuses, told TechCrunch: \u201cNSO is clearly on a campaign to get removed from the U.S. Entity List and one of the key things they need to show is that they have dramatically changed as a company since they were listed.\u201d\n\u201cChanging the leadership is one part and this transparency report is another,\u201d said Krapiva.\n\u201cHowever, we have seen this before with NSO and other spyware companies over the years where they change names and leadership and publish empty transparency or ethics reports but the abuses continue.\u201d\nContact Us Do you know more information about NSO Group? Or other spyware makers?

Or other spyware makers? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or email\n\u201cThis is nothing but another attempt at window dressing and the U.S. government should not be taken for a fool,\u201d said Krapiva.\nEver since the Biden administration added NSO to the Entity List, the company has lobbied to have its restrictions lifted. After President Donald Trump took office again last year, NSO intensified these efforts. But, as of May last year, NSO had failed to sway the new administration.\nIn late December, the Trump administration lifted sanctions against three executives tied to the Intellexa spyware consortium, in what some saw as a sign of a shift in the administration\u2019s attitude toward spyware makers.\nA lack of details\nThis year\u2019s transparency report, which covers 2025, has fewer details than reports from previous years.\nIn an earlier transparency report covering 2024, for example, NSO said it opened three investigations of potential misuse. Without naming the customers, the company said it cut ties with one, and imposed on another customer \u201calternative remediation measures,\u201d including mandating human rights training, monitoring the customer activities, and requesting more information about how the customer uses the system. NSO did not provide any information about the third investigation.\nNSO also said that during 2024, the company rejected more than $20 million \u201cin new business opportunities due to human rights concerns.\u201d\nIn the transparency report published the prior year, covering 2022 and 2023, NSO said it suspended or terminated six government customers, without naming them, claiming these actions resulted in a revenue loss of $57 million.\nIn 2021, NSO said it had \u201cdisconnected\u201d the systems of five customers since 2016 following an investigation of misuse, resulting in more than $100 million in \u201cestimated loss of revenue,\u201d and it also said that it \u201cdiscontinued engagements\u201d with five customers due to \u201cconcerns regarding human rights.\u201d\nNSO\u2019s newest transparency report does not include the total number of customers NSO has, statistics that have been consistently present in previous reports.\nTechCrunch asked NSO spokesperson Gil Lanier to provide similar statistics and figures, but did not receive answers by press time.\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, a human rights organization that has investigated spyware abuses for more than a decade, criticized NSO.\n\u201cI was expecting information, numbers,\u201d Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. \u201cNothing in this document allows outsiders to verify NSO\u2019s claims, which is business as usual from a company that has a decade-long history of making claims that later turned out to be misrepresentation.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
