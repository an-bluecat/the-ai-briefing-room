And by this definition, OpenAI is many years away from reaching it.\nThe two companies reportedly signed an agreement last year stating OpenAI has only achieved AGI when it develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits.

Paresh Dave | Reuters\nDespite General Motor's decision to shutter its Cruise robotaxi business earlier this month, the U.S. has never been closer to a driverless future. For the autonomous vehicle industry, 2024 will be remembered as the year that at least one major U.S. player -- Alphabet -owned Waymo -- saw glimmers of mainstream adoption and made strides toward commercial viability. That came after a rocky start for the self-driving car industry domestically. Following a decade of sizable venture investments in AV companies, Uber sold off its self-driving business in 2020 after a fatal collision, and two years later Ford abandoned its stake in its robotaxi developers Argo.AI. In 2023, Cruise paused all of its driverless operations after collisions led to investigations and a suspension of its licenses in California. When GM decided to retreat from the robotaxi business earlier this month, it had already poured $10 billion into Cruise. Waymo may have outlasted Cruise to lead the U.S. market but domestic competitors are working to catch up, too -- most notably Elon Musk's automaker Tesla and Amazon -owned Zoox. At stake is a share of a massive market for ride-hailing services in and beyond the U.S. According to research by Fortune Business Insights, the global ride-sharing market is projected to grow from an estimated $123.08 billion in 2024 to $480.09 billion by 2032. As 2025 approaches, here's where these major players stand.\nHyundai Motor and Waymo have agreed to a multiyear, strategic partnership that includes the self-driving company adding the South Korean automaker's Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet. Courtesy image\nWaymo pulls way ahead What began as \"project chauffeur\" at Google in 2009 became a publicly available, commercial robotaxi service across multiple U.S. cities this year. The project, rebranded as Waymo in 2016, has now completed more than 5 million autonomous trips in total, the company said last week. That's about a sevenfold increase from November 2023, when Waymo said it had completed around 700,000 driverless ride-hailing trips. Waymo's service now operates in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, covering more than 500 square miles of public roads. The company dropped its digital velvet rope in June and opened its robotaxi service to all San Franciscans, allowing them to hail rides via the Waymo One app. Opening to the general public proved to riders, and internally, that the company's fleet of AVs can work well in the traffic conditions of a complex urban environment. In July, Alphabet's then-CFO, Ruth Porat, announced a multiyear investment by Google's parent into Waymo on an earnings call, which amounted to $5.6 billion in total, with $5 billion of that coming from Alphabet. Waymo co-CEOs, Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov, told employees at an all-hands meeting in November that they should scale up as aggressively as possible but do so with safety at the forefront of all their efforts, company insiders told CNBC. A big focus for Waymo in 2025 will be expanding its robotaxi service to more cities, winning over riders and continuing research and development on newer technology that will allow the company's AVs to operate in more weather and traffic conditions. Waymo plans to launch a commercial service in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, with rides available through the Uber app next year. It's also begun testing in Miami with plans to offer rides to the public there in 2026. Earlier this month, Waymo announced its first international testing destination in Tokyo. Waymo said it's partnered with the taxi app GO and one of Japan's largest taxi operators, Nihon Kotsu, and will commence test rides in early 2025. Waymo showed off its next generation of self-driving vehicles, which it will be making with Chinese auto giant Geely, in August. Waymo's custom hardware and software will be integrated into the Geely Zeekr electric SUVs. For this new robotaxi, Waymo was able to reduce the number of cameras on board from 29 to 13 and lower the number of costly lidar sensors on board from five to four. The company also announced a partnership with Hyundai in October to integrate the automaker's Ioniq 5 SUV into Waymo's fleet of vehicles. The companies said they will begin testing the Waymo Ioniq 5s by late 2025. Waymo is already conducting testing and validation drives in Detroit, Buffalo, New York, and at a test track in Columbus, Ohio, with its Jaguar I-Pace and newer Geely Zeekr vehicles to understand how these systems will perform in different types of traffic and weather. Given its progress and increasing presence on U.S. streets, Waymo received plenty of social media and publicity in 2024, stirring delight and controversy. In a Reddit channel, R/Waymo, users document every incident involving the company, including one in February where a crowd attacked a Waymo vehicle and set it on fire. The forum also dissected instances when Waymo vehicles were involved in collisions or backed up traffic. A separate incident went viral when a woman posted on X in September that she was stuck in her Waymo robotaxi when two men stopped it by standing outside of the vehicle, asking for her phone number. To maintain public trust in the safety of its service, Waymo has built a large public affairs operation, published more detailed safety reports in 2024, and is working closely with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, first responders and authorities in the cities where it operates.\nTesla's Cybercab robotaxi is displayed during the AutoMobility LA 2024 auto show at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, November 21, 2024. Robyn Beck | AFP | Getty Images\nTesla unwraps its robotaxi concept Musk, Tesla's CEO, has been promising \"robotaxi-ready\" cars for about a decade. Each year since 2016, he has declared the company is about a year away from making his vision a reality, but Tesla still doesn't manufacture robotaxis or run a driverless ride-hailing service. While Tesla didn't deliver on its robotaxi promises in 2024, Musk revealed the look and feel of Tesla's \"dedicated robotaxi\" at an event in October held at a movie studio lot in Burbank, California. He called the vehicle the Cybercab and said Tesla wants to produce it by 2027 and sell it for under $30,000. The fan-pleasing robotaxi concept was a two-seater with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals. The Petersen Automotive Museum already added a preproduction Cybercab to its collection earlier this month. At the October event, Tesla also showed off the Robovan, a low-clearance autonomous bus with an art deco design aesthetic. Musk has promised that Tesla's Model Y and other vehicles will be able to function as robotaxis as early as 2025 once their systems are upgraded. Model Y vehicles, without safety drivers on board, also circulated in the closed environment of the studio lot at the Burbank event, showing how Tesla envisions they will function as robotaxis. At the time of that \"We, Robot\" event, Tesla had not applied for licenses and permits that would allow it to operate a commercial robotaxi service in major U.S. markets where they are required by city or state authorities. Despite the lack of permits and licenses, Musk told analysts in an October earnings call that Tesla had already built a \"development app\" allowing employees to request a ride that would take them anywhere in the San Francisco Bay Area. Bullish investors say Tesla will make good on its driverless technology promises as early as next year, but critics remain skeptical in part because of Musk's many missed deadlines on robotaxis. Tesla currently sells driver assistance systems, including its standard Autopilot option and a premium paid option called Full Self-Driving supervised. In correspondence with government agencies, Tesla calls these \"partially automated\" systems that are not robotaxi-ready. In fine print in its EV manuals, Tesla says FSD and Autopilot require a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at all times. This year, Tesla corresponded with authorities in Austin regarding safety expectations for its autonomous vehicle technology. Musk has repeatedly painted regulation as a hurdle that prevented Tesla from putting self-driving cars on U.S. roads. On a Tesla earnings call on Oct. 23, Musk said he would use his sway with now President-elect Donald Trump to establish a \"federal approval process for autonomous vehicles.\" However, AV policy expert Bryant Walker Smith rejected the notion that regulation has curtailed any robotaxi business in a post for Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. Pointing to Waymo as an example, Walker Smith wrote, \"AVs can be \u2014 and in fact are \u2014 lawfully deployed and regulated under existing federal statutory law.\"\nA Zoox autonomous robotaxi in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nZoox 'toasters' heat up Well before Tesla showed off its Robovan and Cybercab designs, Zoox in February secured important permits allowing it to carry members of the public in its autonomous vehicles in Foster City, California, this year. Founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon in 2020 in a deal worth around $1.3 billion, Zoox has developed a unique self-driving shuttle that features big side windows, inward-facing seats and no steering wheel, driver's seat or traditional windshield. Zoox in March expanded the environmental conditions its AVs can handle on public roads to include \"nighttime driving, driving under light rain and damp road conditions, and at speeds up to 45 mph,\" a spokesperson told CNBC. The company's vehicles can carry four adults and luggage comfortably, and the small shuttles feature calming lighting, ambient music and interior cameras to monitor what's happening inside the cabin. Some early riders have described the look of the Zoox vehicles as \"futuristic hot dog toasters\" or \"toasters on wheels.\" Led by CEO Aicha Evans, Zoox is aiming to offer free rides to more members of the public early next year, before opening up to paying customers and the general public. The service will start in Las Vegas and expand to San Francisco, the company told CNBC. It will begin with an early rider program called Zoox Explorers, allowing select users to ride in a Zoox for free and provide feedback. With its robotaxis currently on public roads in Las Vegas, San Francisco and Foster City, this summer, Zoox also began testing in Austin and Miami, where its test fleet is still driving. The company has also been attracting senior talent. One notable recent hire was Zheng Gao, previously the leader of Tesla's autopilot hardware design team, now director of hardware engineering for Zoox.\nA in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday Aug. 10, 2023. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\nCruise's closure Despite clear demand for robotaxi rides in the U.S. market, GM surprised some longtime industry observers when it announced earlier this month that it was exiting the business. \"Cruise was well on its way to a robotaxi business, but when you look at the fact you're deploying a fleet, there's a whole operations piece of doing that,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said on a call announcing the strategic change. The Detroit automaker will now focus on the development of what it calls \"personal autonomous vehicles\" instead of robotaxis. GM has yet to determine how many of Cruise's 2,300 employees will move into its broader tech team. \"In case it was unclear before, it is clear now: GM are a bunch of dummies,\" Cruise founder Kyle Vogt, who sold Cruise to GM in 2016 and left the company in November 2023, posted on X after the automaker's exit announcement. An early entrant in the U.S. robotaxi market, Cruise grounded its driverless operations in October 2023, shortly before Vogt's departure. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fined Cruise $1.5 million after the company failed to disclose details of a serious crash that month involving a pedestrian. A third-party probe into the incident ordered by GM and Cruise found that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership led to the accident.\nwatch now\n\ntitle3:\nChatGPT and Sora went down for the second time this month\ndescription3:\nChatGPT, Sora, and OpenAI\u2019s developer-facing API were down on Thursday for more than four hours.

Clive Brunskill | Getty Images\nIt's been a good year for Larry Ellison. Oracle's co-founder has gained roughly $75 billion in paper wealth as the software company he started in 1979 enjoyed its biggest stock rally since 1999 and the dot-com boom. While the S&P 500 index has gained 27% in 2024, Oracle shares have shot up 63%, lifting Ellison's net worth to more than $217 billion, according to Forbes, behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among the world's richest people. At 80, Ellison is a senior citizen in the tech industry, where his fellow billionaire founders are generally decades younger. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth has also ballooned past $200 billion, is half his age. But Ellison has found the fountain of youth both personally and professionally. After being divorced several times, Ellison was reported this month to be involved with a 33-year-old woman. And at a meeting with analysts in Las Vegas in September, Ellison was as engaged as ever, mentioning offhand that the night before, he and his son were having dinner with his good friend Musk, who's advising President-elect Donald Trump (then the Republican nominee) while running Tesla and his other ventures. His big financial boon has come from Oracle, which has maneuvered its way into the artificial intelligence craze with its cloud infrastructure technology and has made its databases more accessible. ChatGPT creator OpenAI said in June that it will use Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Earlier this month, Oracle said it had also picked up business from Meta. Startups, which often opt for market leader Amazon Web Services when picking a cloud, have been engaging Oracle as well. Last year, video generation startup Genmo set up a system to train an AI model with Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, in Oracle's cloud, CEO Paras Jain said. Genmo now relies on the Oracle cloud to produce videos based on the prompts that users type in on its website. \"Oracle produced a different product than what you can get elsewhere with GPU computing,\" Jain said. The company offers \"bare metal\" computers that can sometimes yield better performance than architectures that employ server virtualization, he said. In its latest earnings report earlier this month, Oracle came up short of analysts' estimates and issued a forecast that was also weaker than Wall Street was expecting. The next day, the stock fell 7% in the worst performance of the year, eating into the gains for 2024.\nwatch now\nStill, Ellison was bullish for the future. \"Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds,\" Ellison said in the earnings release. For the current fiscal year, which ends in May, Oracle is expected to record revenue growth of about 10%, which would mark its second-strongest year of expansion since 2011. Jain said that when Genmo has challenges, he communicates with Oracle sales executives and engineers through a Slack channel. The collaboration has resulted in better reliability and performance, he said. Jain said Oracle worked with Genmo to ensure that developers could launch the startup's Mochi open-source video generator on Oracle's cloud hardware with a single click. \"Oracle was also more price-competitive than these large hyperscalers,\" Jain said.\n'That's going to be so easy'\nThree months before its December earnings report, at the analyst event in Las Vegas, Oracle had given a rosy outlook for the next three years. Executive Vice President Doug Kehring declared that the company would produce more than $66 billion in revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, and over $104 billion in fiscal 2029. The numbers suggested acceleration, with a compound annual growth rate of over 16%, compared with 9% in the latest quarter. After Kehring and CEO Safra Catz spoke, it was Ellison's turn. The company's chairman, technology chief and top shareholder strutted onto the stage in a black sweater and jeans, waved to the analysts, licked his lips and sat down. For the next 74 minutes, he answered questions from seven analysts. \"Did \u2014 did he say $104 billion?\" Ellison said, referring to Kehring's projection. Some in the crowd giggled. \"That's going to be so easy. It is kind of crazy.\" Oracle's revenue in fiscal 2023 was just shy of $50 billion. The new target impressed Eric Lynch, managing director of Scharf Investments, which held $167 million in Oracle shares at the end of September. \"For a company doing single digits for a decade or so, that's unbelievable,\" Lynch told CNBC in an interview.\nOracle co-founder and Chairman Larry Ellison delivers a keynote address during the Oracle OpenWorld on October 22, 2018 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\nOracle is still far behind in cloud infrastructure. In 2023, Amazon controlled 39% of the market, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 8.2%, according to industry researcher Gartner. That left Oracle with 1.4%. But in database software, Oracle remains a stalwart. Gartner estimated that the company had 17% market share in database management systems in 2023. Ellison's challenge is to find opportunities for expansion. Last year, he visited Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, for the first time to announce a partnership that would enable organizations to use Oracle's database through Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft even installed Oracle hardware in its data centers. In June, Oracle rolled out a similar announcement with Google. Then, in September, Oracle finally partnered with Amazon, introducing its database on AWS. Oracle and Amazon had exchanged barbs for years. AWS introduced a database called Aurora in 2014, and Amazon worked hard to move itself off Oracle. Following a CNBC report on the effort, Ellison expressed doubt about Amazon's ability to reach its goal. But the project succeeded. In 2019, Amazon published a blog post titled, \"Migration Complete \u2013 Amazon's Consumer Business Just Turned off its Final Oracle Database.\"\nFriendlier vibe\nEllison looked back on the history between the two companies at the analyst meeting in September. \"I got kind of got cute commenting about Amazon uses Oracle, doesn't use AWS, blah, blah,\" he said. \"And that hurt some people's feelings. I probably shouldn't have said it.\" He said a friend at a major New York bank had asked him to make sure the Oracle database works on AWS. \"I said, 'Great. It makes sense to me,'\" Ellison said. The multi-cloud strategy should deliver gains in database market share, said analyst Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho, which has the equivalent of a buy rating on Oracle shares. Cloud deals related to AI will also help Oracle deliver on its promise for faster revenue growth, he said. \"Oracle right now has an end-to-end stack for enterprises to build their AI strategy,\" said Panigrahi, who worked on applications at Oracle in the 2000s. So far, Oracle has been mainly cutting high-value AI deals with the likes of OpenAI and Musk's X.ai. Of Oracle's $97 billion in remaining performance obligations, or revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, 40% or 50% of it is tied to renting out GPUs, Panigrahi said. Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment. Panigrahi predicts that a wider swath of enterprises will begin adopting AI, which will be a boon to Oracle given its hundreds of thousands of big customers. There's also promise in Oracle Health, the segment that came out of the company's $28.2 billion acquisition of electronic health record software vendor Cerner in 2022.\nYoshiki Hayashi, Marc Benioff and Larry Ellison attend the Transformative Medicine of USC: Rebels with a Cause Gala in Santa Monica, California, on Oct. 24, 2019. Joshua Blanchard | Getty Images\nUnlike rival Epic, Oracle Health lost U.S. market share in 2023, according to estimates from KLAS Research. But Ellison's connection to Musk, who is set to co-lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, might benefit Oracle Health \"if there is a bigger push towards modernizing existing healthcare systems,\" analysts at Evercore said in a note last week. They recommend buying the stock. For now, Oracle is busy using AI to rewrite Cerner's entire code base, Ellison said at the analyst event. \"This is another pillar for growth,\" he said. \"I think you haven't quite seen it yet.\" Hours earlier, Ellison had put in a call to Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce .
