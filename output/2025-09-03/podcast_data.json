Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday September 4), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMistral, the French AI giant, is reportedly on the cusp of securing a $14B valuation\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nFrench AI startup Mistral AI is finalizing a \u20ac2 billion investment at a post-money valuation of $14 billion, reports Bloomberg, positioning the company as one of Europe\u2019s most valuable tech startups. The two-year-old OpenAI rival, founded by former DeepMind and Meta researchers, develops open source language models and Le Chat, its AI chatbot built for European audiences.\nMistral isn\u2019t commenting on the report, but the round would represent Mistral\u2019s first major raise since June 2024, when it was valued at \u20ac5.8 billion. The company has previously raised over \u20ac1 billion from prominent investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst.\nThe investment comes as European AI startups gain unprecedented momentum. European AI companies secured 55% more year-on-year investment in Q1 2025, according to Dealroom, with 12 European startups achieving unicorn status in the first half of the year. Also leading this surge is Sweden\u2019s Lovable, an AI coding platform that reached a $1.8 billion valuation in July just eight months after its launch.\n\ntitle1:\nApple's Siri upgrade could reportedly be powered by Google Gemini\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nApple\u2019s Siri overhaul may include an AI-powered web search tool with technology powered by Google\u2019s Gemini, according to a new report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. The iPhone maker, which has been criticized for falling behind in the AI race, delayed its long-awaited Siri update until 2026. In the meantime, the company has been scrambling to determine whether its own AI models alone will work well enough to make its upgraded Siri competitive with the AI answer engines available today from tech companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google.\nPer Bloomberg, Apple could be turning to Google for a solution to its problems. The report claims that Apple and Google reached a formal agreement this week that will see Apple testing a Google AI model in Siri. If successful, the technology could also be used in other areas of iPhone software, including the Safari browser and Spotlight search, which is available on the Home Screen.\nIn previous years, Spotlight seemed to be ramping up to become a rival of sorts to Google, as it allowed iPhone users to bypass web searches to get basic answers about popular topics, like information about actors, musicians, TV shows, and movies, among other things. With AI chatbots, however, consumers can now source quick answers about a wide range of topics beyond those that could be found on Wikipedia.\nThe report suggests that the upgraded search experience\u2019s interface will use a combination of text, photos, videos, and local points of interest, as well as an AI-powered summarization feature. It will also be able to tap into users\u2019 personal data and let them navigate their devices via voice.\n\ntitle2:\nScale AI is suing a former employee and rival Mercor, alleging they tried to steal its biggest customers\ndescription2:\nScale AI, which helps tech companies prepare data to train their AI models, filed a lawsuit against one of its former sales employees and its rival Mercor on Wednesday. The suit claims the employee, who was hired by Mercor, \u201cstole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale\u2019s customer strategies and other proprietary information,\u201d according to a copy seen by TechCrunch.\nScale is suing Mercor for misappropriation of trade secrets and is suing the former employee, Eugene Ling, for breach of contract. The suit also claims the employee was trying to pitch Mercor to one of Scale\u2019s largest customers before he officially left his former job. The suit calls this company \u201cCustomer A.\u201d\nMercor co-founder Surya Midha denies that his company used any data from Scale, although he admits that Ling may have been in possession of some.\n\u201cWhile Mercor has hired many people who departed Scale, we have no interest in any of Scale\u2019s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way. Eugene informed us that he had old documents in a personal Google Drive, which we have never accessed and are now investigating,\u201d Midha told TechCrunch in an emailed statement.\n\u201cWe reached out to Scale six days ago offering to have Eugene destroy the files or reach a different resolution, and we are now awaiting their response,\u201d Midha said.\nScale alleges that these documents contained the specific data that would allow Mercor to serve Customer A, as well as several other of Scale\u2019s most important clients.\nScale wanted Mercor to give it a full list of the files in the drive, and to prevent Ling from working with Customer A. It alleges in the suit that Mercor refused. Ling did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment, but he later wrote on X: \u201cJust heard I\u2019m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nContinued Ling, \u201cWhen Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I\u2019m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I\u2019ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that\u2019s up to them. But I just wanted to say that there truly was no nefarious intent here. I\u2019m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this.\u201d\nThere are scant clues in the suit about the identity of Customer A. The suit does say that if Scale\u2019s rival did win this customer away, it would be a contract \u201cworth millions of dollars to Mercor.\u201d\nWhatever the details of this suit, it does show one thing: Scale is clearly concerned enough about the threat of Mercor to pursue legal action. As TechCrunch previously reported, even with Meta\u2019s multibillion-dollar investment into Scale, TBD Labs \u2014 the core unit within Meta tasked with building AI superintelligence \u2014 is still using Mercor and other LLM data training service providers.\nMercor is rising in the LLM training arena because it is known for hiring content specialists, often PhDs, to train LLM data in their areas of expertise.\nIn June, Scale announced that Meta was investing $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in Scale and was hiring away its founder. Shortly after that, several of Scale AI\u2019s largest data customers, who are competitors to Meta\u2019s efforts, reportedly cut ties with it.\nUpdated with comments on social media from Eugene Ling.\n\ntitle3:\nSpaceX gets a green light to more than double its Florida launches\ndescription3:\nThe world\u2019s most-flown rocket may start flying even more.\nU.S. regulators have completed a key environmental review that paves the way for SpaceX to more than double the number of Falcon 9 launches from Florida\u2019s Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\nIn addition to the annual launch increase from 50 launches to up to 120, the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s environmental review also approved a new on-site landing zone that could accommodate up to 34 booster landings per year. These boosters are the reusable first-stage portions of Falcon 9 rockets that SpaceX lands and refurbishes for future flights.\nThe review, finalized on Wednesday, found what\u2019s known as a \u201cMitigated Finding of No Significant Impact,\u201d meaning the proposed changes \u201cwould not significantly impact the quality of the human environment\u201d under federal law, with impacts reduced by specific protective measures.\nThose measures include obtaining additional environmental permits before construction of the new facilities, using sea turtle-friendly lighting at night, and conducting pre-construction surveys of Florida scrub-jay and eastern indigo snake populations to ensure wildlife protection.\nRegarding water management, the review concluded it is highly unlikely for industrial wastewater \u2014 specifically the huge volumes of water discharged by the deluge system during launch \u2014 to discharge into nearby waters.\nThe deluge system, which sprays massive amounts of water onto the launch pad during liftoff to absorb heat and sound from the rocket engines, has been contentious. At SpaceX\u2019s Starbase launch site in Texas, environmental groups sued local regulators over authorizations allowing the company to discharge industrial wastewater from the pad.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nWednesday\u2019s environmental approval is just one step in the process. SpaceX still needs the FAA to officially modify its launch license to allow the higher launch numbers. The Department of the Air Force must also approve the changes since the launch pad sits on Space Force property.\nThe approval paves the way for SpaceX to continue its trend of ramping up Falcon 9 launches each year. Launch frequency has climbed sharply in recent years, going from 60 launches per year in 2022 to 132 in 2024.\nEven as the most-launched rocket in the world, SpaceX still has a crowded manifest. It conducts launches for commercial customers, the Department of Defense, and its own Starlink internet satellites. The launch increase should ease this bottleneck. The dedicated landing zone could also shorten booster turnarounds, as the company will not need to rely on landing the booster offshore on a drone ship as frequently.\nThe decision is part of a much broader multi-site push by SpaceX to increase its launch cadence. The company is also looking to expand on the West Coast, with plans to launch as many as 100 Falcon launches per year from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Meanwhile, regulators are also reviewing a proposal that would allow for an increase in Starship launches \u2014 SpaceX\u2019s much larger rocket designed for moon and Mars missions \u2014 from both Texas and Florida.\n\ntitle4:\nOrchard Robotics, founded by a Thiel fellow Cornell dropout, raises $22M for farm vision AI\ndescription4:\nInspired by his grandparents, who were apple farmers in China, Charlie Wu got the idea to apply technology to agriculture while studying computer science at Cornell University, a top agriculture school.\n\u201cI got to meet fruit professors who are the best in the world at what they do,\u201d Wu told TechCrunch. \u201cThrough talking to them, I realized even the largest farms in the nation basically have no idea what is actually growing out in their fields.\u201d\nHe dropped out of Cornell, became a Thiel fellow, and in 2022 began building Orchard Robotics, a startup that uses cameras and AI to help fruit growers manage their crops more precisely.\nOn Wednesday, Orchard Robotics announced that it raised a $22 million Series A funding led by Quiet Capital and Shine Capital, and with participation from returning investors, including General Catalyst and Contrary.\nAlthough the idea of using computer vision for specialty crops isn\u2019t new, Wu says that the largest farms in the U.S. still rely on manual sampling to make critical decisions about farm operations.\nSince farmers inspect only a small percentage of their crops, their estimations of how many healthy fruits they have on their vineyard or orchard can be extremely imprecise.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re growing in the field, you don\u2019t know how much chemical to apply to it. You don\u2019t know how many workers to hire to harvest it. You don\u2019t know what you can actually sell and market,\u201d Wu said.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Those images are then analyzed by AI for fruit size, color, and health.\nThe data is then uploaded into Orchard\u2019s cloud-based software, which acts as a central record for making decisions such as the vines or trees that may need extra fertilization, pruning, or thinning.\nOrchard is already in use in some of the country\u2019s largest apple and grape farms, and the startup recently began to offer its technology to blueberries, cherries, almonds, pistachios, citrus, and strawberry growers.\nThe company is not alone in its use of tractor-mounted cameras to leverage AI for specialty crop image analysis. Orchard\u2019s direct competitors include Bloomfield Robotics, which last year was acquired by farm equipment manufacturer Kubota, as well as seed-stage startups Vivid Robotics and Green Atlas.\nWu admits the existing market for fruit and vegetable data is only $1.5 billion, but he believes that future AI advancements will allow the technology to make autonomous decisions, expanding Orchard\u2019s product offerings.\nHe hopes Orchard\u2019s evolution mirrors that of Flock Safety, a public safety startup now valued at $7.5 billion, which over the past eight years has expanded from simply collecting license plate information to a range of other products, including gunshot detection and video surveillance.\n\u201cOur ambition is to be a lot more than just collecting data,\u201d Wu said. \u201cWe want to collect the data, then build an operating system on top of the data, and then eventually own all the workflows in the farm, and that\u2019s going to have the potential to expand our market by quite a bit.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
