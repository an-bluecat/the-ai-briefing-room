Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Intel will be an anchor investor in the stand-alone business and will seek outside capital.\nIntel was rumored to be looking for a buyer for its Network and Edge group in May. This business produced $5.8 billion in revenue in 2024.\nThis strategy seems similar to the company\u2019s decision to spin off RealSense, its former stereoscopic imaging technology business, earlier this month. Intel decided to spin RealSense out during former CEO Pat Gelsinger\u2019s tenure and the company struck out on its own with $50 million in venture funding.\nTechCrunch reached out for more information about its plans and timeline for the spinout.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta names Shengjia Zhao as chief scientist of AI superintelligence unit\ndescription1:\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that former OpenAI researcher Shengjia Zhao will lead research efforts at the company\u2019s new AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Zhao contributed to several of OpenAI\u2019s largest breakthroughs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, and the company\u2019s first AI reasoning model, o1.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to share that Shengjia Zhao will be the Chief Scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads Friday. \u201cShengjia co-founded the new lab and has been our lead scientist from day one. Now that our recruiting is going well and our team is coming together, we have decided to formalize his leadership role.\u201d\nZhao will set a research agenda for MSL under the leadership of Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of Scale AI who was recently hired to lead the new unit.\nWe are excited to announce that @shengjia_zhao will be the Chief Scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs!\nShengjia is a brilliant scientist who most recently pioneered a new scaling paradigm in his research. He will lead our scientific direction for our team.\nLet's go \ud83d\ude80 pic.twitter.com/D93KQWIvFl \u2014 Alexandr Wang (@alexandr_wang) July 25, 2025\nWang, who does not have a research background, was viewed as a somewhat unconventional choice to lead an AI lab. The addition of Zhao, who is a reputable research leader known for developing frontier AI models, rounds out the leadership team. To further fill out the unit, Meta has hired several high-level researchers from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Safe Superintelligence, Apple, and Anthropic, as well as pulling researchers from Meta\u2019s existing Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab and generative AI unit.\nZuckerberg notes in his post that Zhao has pioneered several breakthroughs, including a \u201cnew scaling paradigm.\u201d The Meta CEO is likely referencing Zhao\u2019s work on OpenAI\u2019s reasoning model, o1, in which he is listed as a foundational contributor alongside OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever. Meta currently doesn\u2019t offer a competitor to o1, so AI reasoning models are a key area of focus for MSL.\nThe Information reported in June that Zhao would be joining Meta Superintelligence Labs, alongside three other influential OpenAI researchers \u2014 Jiahui Yu, Shuchao Bi, and Hongyu Ren. Meta has also recruited Trapit Bansal, another OpenAI researcher who worked on AI reasoning models with Zhao, as well as three employees from OpenAI\u2019s Zurich office who worked on multimodality.\nZuckerberg has gone to great lengths to set MSL up for success. The Meta CEO has been on a recruiting spree to staff up his AI superintelligence lab, which has entailed sending personal emails to researchers and inviting prospects to his Lake Tahoe estate. Meta has reportedly offered some researchers eight- and nine-figure compensation packages, some of which are \u201cexploding offers\u201d that expire in a matter of days.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nMeta has also upped its investment in cloud computing infrastructure, which should help MSL conduct the massive training runs required to create competitive frontier AI models.\nBy 2026, Zhao and MSL\u2019s researchers should have access to Meta\u2019s 1 gigawatt cloud computing cluster, Prometheus, located in Ohio. Once online, Meta will be one of the first technology companies with an AI training cluster of Prometheus\u2019 size \u2014 1 gigawatt is enough energy to power more than 750,000 homes. That should help Meta conduct the massive training runs required to create frontier AI models.\nWith the addition of Zhao, Meta now has two chief AI scientists, including Yann LeCun, the leader of Meta\u2019s FAIR lab. Unlike MSL, FAIR is designed to focus on long-term AI research \u2014 techniques that may be used five to 10 years from now. How exactly Meta\u2019s three AI units will work together remains to be seen.\nNevertheless, Meta now seems to have a formidable AI leadership team to compete with OpenAI and Google.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla wants to bring robotaxis to San Francisco. Here's what's standing in the way.\ndescription2:\nTesla is launching an even-more-limited version of its early robotaxi service in San Francisco this weekend, according to Business Insider, after an initial rollout began last month in Austin, Texas.\nThe company plans to send invites to Tesla owners to test the service, according to the report.\nDepending on how and if Tesla proceeds, its actions could violate state regulations \u2014 and even if there\u2019s a human safety driver sitting behind the wheel while its vehicles operate autonomously.\nTwo state agencies regulate aspects of autonomous vehicles in California. The California Department of Motor Vehicles regulates the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles, and requires permits for all three stages: testing with a driver, testing without a driver, and driverless deployment.\nTesla holds a permit for testing autonomous vehicles with a human safety operator behind the wheel. It doesn\u2019t have a permit for driverless testing or deployment. And as of Wednesday it had not yet applied for additional permits, according to the DMV. (Mercedes-Benz, Nuro, and Waymo are the only three companies that hold driverless deployment permits.)\nNor does Tesla have the proper permits from the California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates the commercial aspects of ride-hailing and chartered transportation by humans as well as those steered by autonomous vehicle systems.\nTesla has a Transportation Charter Party permit, which allows a human driver to drive a traditional vehicle (not an AV) for charter services with the public, CPUC spokesperson Terrie Prosper told TechCrunch in an email.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThis is distinctly different from an autonomous vehicle permit for passenger transportation, according to Prosper. So-called AV authorizations, which Tesla doesn\u2019t have, allows for the testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles with or without a driver.\nTesla has not received approval from the CPUC to offer autonomous passenger service to customers, paid or unpaid, with or without a driver (nor has the company applied), Prosper explained in the email. Tesla also doesn\u2019t hold a \u201cDrivered Pilot AV permit\u201d from the CPUC, so it cannot even use an autonomous vehicle with a human operator behind the wheel for passenger service.\nThis means that if Tesla deploys its robotaxis and the autonomous systems are engaged it will be violating state regulations even if the rides are free and there is a human safety operator behind the wheel.\nThe push into California comes as the DMV is currently trying to stop Tesla from selling vehicles in the state as part of a years-long lawsuit over the promises the company has made about its cars\u2019 self-driving abilities. Tesla is also currently on trial in a lawsuit over deaths related to the use of its less-capable driver assistance system, Autopilot.\nTesla has also yet to prove that its Full Self-Driving software can be used to power a robotaxi network. While the company has been running an invite-only version of its robotaxi service in Austin since June 22, it\u2019s been a far cry from what Musk has spent years teasing.\nThe service is mostly limited to Austin\u2019s downtown core and main corridors. There is a safety operator in the front passenger seat who can intervene if the car is about to do something wrong or dangerous. While the service launched with around 10 vehicles, it\u2019s not clear how many Model Y SUVs are in operation in the city, nor is it clear how many times those safety operators have had to intervene.\nThat\u2019s a long way from the \u201cgeneral solution\u201d that Musk said Tesla was working on for a decade. Musk was once so confident in the autonomous software Tesla was developing that he said it would take a car from Los Angeles to New York \u2014 a stunt that never happened. Musk said this week that Tesla is also trying to expand to Florida and Arizona. TechCrunch reported earlier this month that Tesla had begun the required certification process to test and operate with and without a driver in Arizona.\nUpdate: This story has been updated to include new information from the CPUC.\n\ntitle3:\nAI referrals to top websites were up 357% year-over-year in June, reaching 1.13B\ndescription3:\nAI referrals to websites still have a way to go to catch up to the traffic that Google Search provides, but they\u2019re growing quickly. According to new data from market intelligence provider Similarweb, AI platforms in June generated over 1.13 billion referrals to the top 1,000 websites globally, a figure that\u2019s up 357% since June 2024.\nHowever, Google Search still accounts for the majority of traffic to these sites, accounting for 191 billion referrals during the same period of June 2025.\nOne particular category of interest these days is news and media. Online publishers are seeing traffic declines and are preparing for a day they\u2019re calling \u201cGoogle Zero,\u201d when Google stops sending traffic to websites.\nFor instance, The Wall Street Journal recently reported on data that showed how AI overviews were killing traffic to news sites. Plus, a Pew Research Center study out this week found that in a survey of 900 U.S. Google users, 18% of some 69,000 searches showed AI Overviews, which led to users clicking links 8% of the time. When there was no AI summary, users clicked links nearly twice as much, or 15% of the time.\nSimilarweb found that June\u2019s AI referrals to news and media websites were up 770% since June 2024. Some sites will naturally rank higher than others that are blocking access to AI platforms, as The New York Times does, as a result of its lawsuit with OpenAI over the use of its articles to train its models.\nIn the news media category, Yahoo led with 2.3 million AI referrals in June 2025, followed by Yahoo Japan (1.9M), Reuters (1.8M), The Guardian (1.7M), India Times (1.2M), and Business Insider (1.0M).\nIn terms of methodology, Similarweb counts AI referrals as web referrals to a domain from an AI platform like ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Claude, and Liner. ChatGPT dominates here, accounting for more than 80% of the AI referrals to the top 1,000 domains.\nThe company\u2019s analysis also looked at other categories beyond news, like e-commerce, science and education, tech/search/social media, arts and entertainment, business, and others.\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nIn e-commerce, Amazon was followed by Etsy and eBay when it came to those sites seeing the most referrals, at 4.5M, 2.0M, and 1.8M, respectively, during June.\nAmong the top tech and social sites, Google, not surprisingly, was at the top of the list, with 53.1 million referrals in June, followed by Reddit (11.1M), Facebook (11.0M), Github (7.4M), Microsoft (5.1M), Canva (5.0M), Instagram (4.7M), LinkedIn (4.4M), Bing (3.1M), and Pinterest (2.5M).\nThe analysis excluded the OpenAI website because so many of its referrals were from ChatGPT, pointing to its services.\nAcross all other domains, the No. 1 site by AI referrals for each category included YouTube (31.2M), Research Gate (3.6M), Zillow (776.2K), Europa.eu (992.9K), Wikipedia (10.8M), NIH.gov (5.2M), Investing.com (1.2M), Home Depot (1.2M), Kayak (456.5K), and Zara (325.6K).\n\ntitle4:\nTesla is reportedly behind on its pledge to build 5,000 Optimus bots this year\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nTesla is well behind the pace needed to meet its earlier stated goal of producing at least 5,000 Optimus humanoid robots this year, The Information reports. Nearly eight months into 2025, and the number of bots Tesla has produced is only in the hundreds, according to two sources. That means Tesla will either need to step it up or push back the deadline.\nThe news comes after Tesla reported a 12% decline in overall revenue in the second quarter due to falling EV sales, less cash from regulatory credits, and a decline in solar and energy storage sales. During the Q2 earnings call earlier this week, Musk said that Tesla would start production on its latest Optimus 3 design by early next year.\n\u201cWe will scale Optimus production as fast as possible and try to get to a million units a year as quickly as possible,\u201d Musk said. \u201cWe think we can get there in less than five years. That\u2019s a reasonable aspiration.\u201d\nRecall that Musk has made bold claims like this before. During Tesla\u2019s 2019 Autonomy Day, Musk said the company would have a fleet of a million robotaxis on the road by 2020. Two years later, he said Tesla would mass-produce robotaxis by 2024. Neither of those projections has yet come to pass.\"\n\nResponse:",
