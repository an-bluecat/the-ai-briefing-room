Instead, they\u2019re ramping things up.\nAmazon is the latest tech giant to announce a massive AI spending plan, with well over $100 billion in predicted capital expenditures for 2025. The \u201cvast majority\u201d of that $100 billion will go toward AI capabilities for its cloud division AWS, CEO Andy Jassy said during Amazon\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday.\n(More specifically, Jassy said Q4 2024\u2019s capex spending of $26.3 billion \u201cis reasonably representative\u201d of what to expect on an annualized basis in 2025. Multiplying that quarterly spend by four gets a cool $105.2 billion.)\nThat\u2019s a huge jump from the $78 billion in capex that Amazon spent in 2024.\nAmazon brushed aside concerns about AI getting so cheap that it would harm its revenue. Instead, Jassy said lower prices would just lead to increased demand for AI. And AWS, which has AI offerings galore, stands to benefit, he argued.\n\u201cSometimes people make the assumption that if you\u2019re able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component \u2026 that somehow it leads to less total spend in technology. We\u2019ve never seen that to be the case,\u201d Jassy said, comparing the boom in AI demand to the early days of the internet and cloud.\nOther Big Tech companies are making the same point this earnings season as worries mount about the returns on their skyrocketing AI expenses.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared last week the company would spend \u201chundreds of billions\u201d on AI in the long term, citing rising inference demand across its billions of users. Meta is slated to spend at least $60 billion on capex in 2025, mostly on AI.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet just boosted its capex for 2025 by a whopping 42% to $75 billion, with CEO Sundar Pichai justifying the spending by saying that decreased AI costs \u201cwill make more use cases feasible.\u201d\nAnd Microsoft announced last month that it would spend $80 billion on AI data centers in 2025 alone.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella even tweeted the Wikipedia page for Jevons Paradox (the concept in economics that lower prices leads to increased demand) right as the DeepSeek discussion was heating up.\nJevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of. https://t.co/omEcOPhdIz \u2014 Satya Nadella (@satyanadella) January 27, 2025\nWhether Jevons Paradox pans out for Big Tech this time remains to be seen. But for now, there\u2019s no signs of any AI spending slowdown just yet.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

That figure is not comparable to analysts' estimates because the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter.\nRevenue for Pinterest's fourth quarter jumped 18% year over year while net income was $1.85 billion, which included the deferred tax benefit.\nThe company's fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, which was higher than the 39% Wall Street was projecting.\nPinterest said it expects first-quarter sales to come in between $837 million and $852 million. The midpoint of that range, $844.5 million, topped analysts' expectations of $833 million.\nThe company said global monthly active users grew 11% year over year to 553 million in the fourth quarter. That was ahead of Wall Street estimates of 547.4 million. Pinterest's fourth-quarter global average revenue per user came in at $2.12, higher than analysts' expectations of $2.09.\nPinterest's latest global monthly active user numbers represent nearly 3% growth from 537 million brought in during the third quarter.\n\"Our strategy is paying off,\" Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. \"People are coming to Pinterest more often, the platform has never been more actionable and our lower funnel focus is driving results for users and advertisers.\"\nPinterest's report comes after other social media companies saw their stock prices rise following strong results for the quarter that ended in December.\nSnap shares jumped in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Last week, Meta reported fourth-quarter results that beat on the top and bottom line.\nReddit will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\ntitle2:\nAmazon set to pass Walmart in revenue for first time\ndescription2:\nIn this article WMT\nAMZN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Noah Berger | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\nAmazon long ago passed Walmart in terms of market cap, but the e-commerce giant is finally poised to leapfrog its brick-and-mortar rival by another key metric: revenue. For the past dozen years, Walmart held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter. In 2012, it overtook oil giant Exxon Mobil , according to LSEG senior research analyst Tajinder Dhillon. Walmart remained in the lead after oil prices tumbled in subsequent years from their previously lofty levels of more than $100 per barrel. In its earnings release after the close of trading Thursday, Amazon is expected to report revenue of $187 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. Walmart reports on Feb. 20, and is projected to announce sales of $180 billion.\nWalmart, which is often dubbed the world's biggest retailer, in reference to its revenue, still leads the way when it comes to annual sales. The company has turned in more than $600 billion in sales in each of the past two years. That number is expected to reach nearly $681 billion for the latest fiscal year. Amazon is catching up. Based on fourth-quarter estimates, Amazon's full year revenue for 2024 will come in at around $638 billion, marking the first time it's surpassed the $600 billion milestone. One big reason Amazon has shot up the charts is its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. Revenue at AWS has more than doubled since 2020 and now accounts for about 17% of total sales. The Covid pandemic also dramatically altered consumer behavior toward online shopping, which has helped Amazon's annual North America sales increase more than 100% since 2019, the year before the pandemic.\nVery few companies ever even reach $100 billion in revenue in a quarter. In addition to Walmart and Amazon, Apple has done so, but only during the holiday quarter, its key iPhone selling period. Last week, Apple reported revenue for the latest quarter of $124 billion. The newest member of the exclusive $100 billion club is UnitedHealth , which saw its top line climb past that mark in the first quarter of last year and then again in the third and fourth quarters. The two companies closest to joining the group, with a little bit of growth, are CVS Health and McKesson . CVS exceeded $95 billion in revenue in the September quarter, while McKesson hit $94 billion.\n\ntitle3:\nReport: OpenAI's ex-CTO, Mira Murati, has recruited OpenAI co-founder John Schulman\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI co-founder John Schulman, who left AI company Anthropic earlier this week after a mere five months, is reportedly joining former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati\u2019s secretive new startup, per Fortune.\nIt\u2019s not clear what Schulman\u2019s role there will be. Fortune wasn\u2019t able to learn that information, and Murati has been tight-lipped about the venture since she left OpenAI in September. But one source did reveal to Fortune that Murati has recruited additional ex-OpenAI staff, including Christian Gibson, who had been serving on OpenAI\u2019s supercomputing team.\nMurati was reportedly in talks to raise over $100 million for her company in October.\nCredited as one of the leading architects of ChatGPT, Schulman left OpenAI last August for Anthropic. He posted about the decision on X, saying it stemmed from a desire to deepen his focus on AI alignment \u2014 the science of ensuring AI behaves as intended \u2014 and engage in more hands-on technical work.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle scraps diversity 'aspirations,' as a federal contractor\ndescription4:\nGoogle is scrapping its diversity goals, becoming the latest tech giant to alter its approach to hiring and promotions following the election of President Donald Trump.\nIn its annual report published on Wednesday, Alphabet excluded language from prior years stating that, \"we are committed to making diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.\"\nFiona Cicconi, Alphabet's chief people officer, told employees in a memo that the company has to make changes due to new requirements.\n\"Because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and U.S. Executive Orders on this topic,\" Cicconi wrote in the memo, which was viewed by CNBC. \"We'll continue to invest in states across the U.S. \u2014 and in many countries globally \u2014 but in the future we will no longer have aspirational goals.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the memo.\nCicconi noted that in 2020, the company set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing offices outside California and New York to improve representation.\nOne of Trump's first acts as president after taking office in January was to sign an executive order ending the government's DEI programs and putting federal officials overseeing those initiatives on leave. And following a midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter above Washington, D.C., last week, Trump blasted former President Joe Biden and DEI policies claiming they \"could have been\" to blame for the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001.\nTech companies have shown an eagerness to appease the new administration following a rocky four years during Trump's first tenure in the White House.\nAmazon said earlier in January that it was halting some of its diversity and inclusion initiatives, and Meta announced plans to end a number of internal programs designed to increase the company's hiring of diverse candidates. Beyond the tech industry, companies including Target , Walmart and McDonald's have made similar changes.\nGoogle's commitments for 2025 had included increasing the number of people from underrepresented groups in leadership by 30% and more than doubling the number of Black workers at non-senior levels.\nThe company began making cuts to its DEI programs in 2023, CNBC reported at the time, getting rid of staffers who were in charge of recruiting underrepresented groups and letting go of DEI leaders who worked with Chief Diversity Officer Melonie Parker.\nParker, who took on her current role in 2019, will work closely on evaluating programs and trainings and update \"those that raise risk, or that aren't as impactful as we'd hoped,\" Cicconi wrote in her memo.\nShe added that the Google's employee resource groups will remain as will the company's work with colleges and universities.\nA Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the company is \"committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we've been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there.\"\nWATCH: Trump blasts Biden, DEI efforts after D.C. plane crash\"\n\nResponse:",
