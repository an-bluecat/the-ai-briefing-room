Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday March 12), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nGoogle has given Anthropic more funding than previously known, show new filings\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nAnthropic, a San Francisco startup often cast as an independent player in the AI race, has deeper ties to Google than previously known. Court documents recently obtained by The New York Times reveal that Google owns a 14% stake in the company and is set to pour another $750 million into it this year through a convertible debt deal. In total, Google\u2019s investment in Anthropic now exceeds $3 billion.\nDespite having no voting rights, board seats, or direct control over the company, Google\u2019s backing raises questions about how independent Anthropic really is. As AI startups increasingly rely on funding from tech giants, regulators have scrutinized whether these deals give incumbents an unfair advantage, though the Justice Department just dropped a proposal that would have forced the sale of some of those stakes.\nGoogle, which is developing its own tech while quietly funding competitors, is clearly hedging its bets. Meanwhile, with Amazon also funneling money into Anthropic \u2014 it has agreed to invest up to $8 billion so far in the outfit \u2014 it\u2019s natural to wonder what such ties mean for Anthropic and other big AI startups. Are they still mavericks or becoming extensions of Big Tech?\nAbove: Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei speaking at Viva Technology in Paris.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta is reportedly testing in-house chips for AI training\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMeta is reportedly testing an in-house chip for training AI systems, a part of a strategy to reduce its reliance on hardware makers like Nvidia.\nAccording to Reuters, Meta\u2019s chip, which is designed to handle AI-specific workloads, was manufactured in partnership with Taiwan-based firm TSMC. The company is piloting a \u201csmall deployment\u201d of the chip and plans to scale up production if the test is successful.\nMeta has deployed custom AI chips before, but only to run models \u2014 not train them. As Reuters notes, several of the company\u2019s chip design efforts have been canceled or otherwise scaled back after failing to meet internal expectations.\nMeta expects to spend $65 billion on capital expenditure this year, much of which will go toward Nvidia GPUs. If the company manages to reduce even a fraction of that cost by shifting to in-house chips, it\u2019d be a big win for the social media giant.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI launches new tools to help businesses build AI agents\ndescription2:\nOn Tuesday, OpenAI released new tools designed to help developers and enterprises build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks.\nThe tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which lets businesses develop custom AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, much like OpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019s Assistants API, which the company plans to sunset in the first half of 2026.\nThe hype around AI agents has grown dramatically in recent years despite the fact that the tech industry has struggled to show people, or even define, what \u201cAI agents\u201d really are. In the most recent example of agent hype running ahead of utility, Chinese startup Butterfly Effect earlier this week went viral for a new AI agent platform called Manus that users quickly discovered didn\u2019t deliver on many of the company\u2019s promises.\nIn other words, the stakes are high for OpenAI to get agents right.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to demo your agent,\u201d Olivier Godement, OpenAI\u2019s API product head, told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cTo scale an agent is pretty hard, and to get people to use it often is very hard.\u201d\nEarlier this year, OpenAI introduced two AI agents in ChatGPT: Operator, which navigates websites on your behalf, and deep research, which compiles research reports for you. Both tools offered a glimpse at what agentic technology can achieve, but left quite a bit to be desired in the \u201cautonomy\u201d department.\nNow with the Responses API, OpenAI wants to sell access to the components that power AI agents, allowing developers to build their own Operator- and deep research-style agentic applications. OpenAI hopes that developers can create some applications with its agent technology that feel more autonomous than what\u2019s available today.\nUsing the Responses API, developers can tap the same AI models (in preview) under the hood of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Search web search tool: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. The models can browse the web for answers to questions, citing sources as they generate replies.\nOpenAI claims that GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search are highly factually accurate. On the company\u2019s SimpleQA benchmark, which measures the ability of models to answer short, fact-seeking questions, GPT-4o search scores 90% while GPT-4o mini search scores 88% (higher is better). For comparison, GPT-4.5 \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s much larger, recently released model \u2014 scores just 63%.\nThe Responses API also includes a file search utility that can quickly scan across files in a company\u2019s databases to retrieve information. (OpenAI claims that it won\u2019t train models on these files.) In addition, developers using the Responses API can tap OpenAI\u2019s Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, which powers Operator. The model generates mouse and keyboard actions, allowing developers to automate computer use tasks like data entry and app workflows.\nEnterprises can optionally run the CUA model, which is releasing in research preview, locally on their own systems, OpenAI said. The consumer version of the CUA available in Operator can only take actions on the web.\nTo be clear, the Responses API won\u2019t solve all the technical problems plaguing AI agents today.\nWhile AI-powered search tools are more accurate than traditional AI models \u2014 a fact that is unsurprising given they can just look up the right answer \u2014 web search does not render AI hallucinations a solved problem. GPT-4o search still gets 10% of factual questions wrong. Beyond their accuracy, AI search tools also tend to struggle with short, navigational queries (such as \u201cLakers score today\u201d), and recent reports suggest that ChatGPT\u2019s citations aren\u2019t always reliable.\nIn a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI said that the CUA model is \u201cnot yet highly reliable for automating tasks on operating systems,\u201d and that it\u2019s susceptible to making \u201cinadvertent\u201d mistakes.\nHowever, OpenAI said these are early iterations of their agent tools, and it\u2019s constantly working to improve them.\nAlongside the Responses API, OpenAI is releasing an open-source toolkit called the Agents SDK, which offers developers free tools to integrate models with their internal systems, put in place safeguards, and monitor AI agent activities for debugging and optimization purposes. The Agents SDK is a follow-up of sorts to OpenAI\u2019s Swarm, a framework for multi-agent orchestration that the company released late last year.\nGodement said he hopes OpenAI can bridge the gap between AI agent demos and products this year, and that, in his opinion, \u201cagents are the most impactful application of AI that will happen.\u201d That echoes a proclamation OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made in January: that 2025 is the year AI agents enter the workforce.\nWhether or not 2025 truly becomes the \u201cyear of the AI agent,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s latest releases show the company wants to shift from flashy agent demos to impactful tools.\n\ntitle3:\nApple's next major OS updates will bring the biggest design overhaul in years\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nApple\u2019s next set of major updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems could bring the biggest design changes across the company\u2019s platforms in years, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.\nThe revamp, set to come in with iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16, will refresh icons, menus, apps, windows, and system buttons while simplifying navigation and control, the report said. The new design is reportedly loosely based on visionOS, the operating system for Apple\u2019s VisionPro VR headset, which uses circular icons and translucent panels for navigation.\nThe changes, said to be a major focus for the software and UI teams in Apple\u2019s design department, are being overseen by Apple\u2019s VP of human interface design Alan Dye, Bloomberg said.\nThe company will first show off iOS 19, iPadOS 19, and macOS 16 at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, the report said.\"\n\nResponse:",
