Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday July 7), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMicrosoft is closing its local operations in Pakistan\ndescription0:\nMicrosoft is closing its operations in Pakistan, marking the end of a 25-year presence in the South Asian nation.\nThe Redmond-based company on Friday told TechCrunch that it is changing its operational model in Pakistan and will now serve its customers through resellers and \u201cother closely located Microsoft offices.\u201d\n\u201cOur customer agreements and service will not be affected by this change,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\u201cWe follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world. Our customers remain our top priority and can expect the same high level of service going forward,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nThe decision will impact five Microsoft employees in Pakistan, according to sources who talked with TechCrunch; they add that Microsoft did not have any engineering resources in Pakistan, unlike India and other growing markets, and had its employees sell Azure and Office products in the country.\nThe closure comes amid broader company restructuring. Pakistan\u2019s Information and Broadcasting Ministry described the Redmond company\u2019s exit \u201cas part of a wider workforce-optimization program.\u201d Earlier this week, the company reduced its workforce by 4%, or about 9,000 roles globally.\nTo prepare for this transition, Microsoft had shifted licensing and commercial contract management for Pakistan to its European hub in Ireland over the past few years, while certified local partners have handled day-to-day service delivery, the ministry said.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe will continue to engage Microsoft\u2019s regional and global leadership to ensure that any structural changes strengthen, rather than diminish, Microsoft\u2019s long-term commitment to Pakistani customers, developers and channel partners,\u201d the ministry noted.\nFormer Microsoft executive and its first lead in Pakistan Jawwad Rehman reported the company\u2019s exit in a post on LinkedIn on Thursday.\n\u201cThis is more than a corporate exit. It\u2019s a sobering signal of the environment our country has created . . . one where even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay. It also reflects on what was done (or not done) with the strong foundation we left behind by the subsequent team and regional management of Microsoft,\u201d Rehman posted.\nThe exit comes just days after Pakistan\u2019s federal government announced its plan to provide IT certifications from tech companies including Google and Microsoft to half a million youth. The move stands in particularly stark contrast to Google, which disclosed a $10.5 million investment in the country\u2019s public education sector last year and is also considering Pakistan as a market to produce half a million Chromebooks by 2026.\nMicrosoft\u2019s exit reflects broader challenges in Pakistan\u2019s tech sector. Unlike India and other regional markets, Pakistan has not established itself as a major engineering outsourcing destination for Western tech giants. Instead, the country\u2019s tech ecosystem is dominated by two main players: local companies that have developed their own engineering capabilities, and Chinese firms like Huawei, which have gained significant market share by providing enterprise-grade infrastructure to telecommunications companies and banks.\nPakistan\u2019s Information and Broadcasting Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nTechCrunch Mobility: The state of EV sales and Rivian secures the next $1B from VW\ndescription1:\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation.

We\u2019re poking around to learn more. In the meantime, here is a little history lesson. Meyhofer was with the National Robotics Engineering Center at Carnegie Mellon University before officially moving over to Uber in 2015. He eventually became CEO of Uber ATG, the self-driving unit that was later sold off to Aurora. Meyhofer has been connected to Kalanick\u2019s CloudKitchens enterprise via a restaurant automation and robotics business called Lab37, which was initially reported by the Spoon back in 2023.\nGot a tip for us?

The term is MVAT, or minimum viable autonomy theater \u2014 when companies deploy the minimum viable autonomy product sufficient to perpetuate a narrative of progress.\nOne possible example: Tesla let a Model Y SUV drive roughly 15 miles from its factory to the apartment complex where the car\u2019s new owner lives, completing what CEO Elon Musk called the first \u201cautonomous delivery\u201d of a customer car. If this is a one-off, aka a demonstration, then it\u2019s an MVAT.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster. Connect deeper.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThis isn\u2019t just to pick on Tesla, by the way. Many other companies have posted flashy videos to showcase the capabilities of their respective automated driving technology. But it was a far more common practice in 2015 \u2014 as AVs were shooting up to the top of the hype cycle.\nElectric vehicles, batteries, & charging\nThe second quarter has ended and that means sales and production numbers! While many automakers issue monthly reports, some of the EV companies we monitor only provide quarterly numbers.\nThe electric Hummer is almost outselling the F-150 Lightning\nLucid sales inch forward as EV maker pushes to ramp Gravity production\nRivian receives the next $1B from Volkswagen as sales struggles continue\nTesla faces second straight year of falling sales after another bad quarter\nMeanwhile, Republican legislators passed a reconciliation act that, among other things, unwinds much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including that solar, wind, and clean hydrogen will all lose incentives under the new bill. EV tax credits are also eliminated for new and used electric vehicles and the installation of home EV-charging equipment.\nThe end of the EV tax credit is already rippling through the industry, including companies that don\u2019t even have an EV yet to sell. Slate Auto, the Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup, was planning to sell a pickup truck for less than $20,000 with the EV tax credit applied. But the language on its website has changed to reflect the bill\u2019s passage.\nAlso a bit of news from the world of electric RVs and vans \u2026 Pebble, the California-based startup we\u2019ve written about before, has started customer deliveries of its flagship all-electric travel trailer. And Grounded, the startup founded by former SpaceX engineers and based in Detroit, delivered its new electric van, called the G3, to its first customer.\nSecurity\nThe FBI and cybersecurity firms are warning that the prolific hacking group known as Scattered Spider is now targeting airlines and the transportation sector.\nQantas, the Australian airline giant, said it experienced a data breach that compromised the personal information of at least 6 million passengers.\n\ntitle2:\nEU says it will continue rolling out AI legislation on schedule\ndescription2:\nThe European Union on Friday said it will stick to its timeline for implementing its landmark AI legislation, in response to a concerted effort by more than a hundred tech companies to delay the bloc\u2019s AI rules, Reuters reported.\nTech companies from across the world, including giants like Alphabet, Meta, Mistral AI and ASML have been urging the European Commission to delay rolling out the AI Act, saying it will hurt Europe\u2019s chances to compete in the fast-evolving AI arena.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen, indeed, a lot of reporting, a lot of letters and a lot of things being said on the AI Act. Let me be as clear as possible, there is no stop the clock. There is no grace period. There is no pause,\u201d the report cited European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier as saying.\nA risk-based regulation for applications of artificial intelligence, the AI Act bans a handful of \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d use cases outright, such as cognitive behavioral manipulation or social scoring. It also defines a set of \u201chigh-risk\u201d uses, such as biometrics and facial recognition, or AI used in domains like education and employment. App developers will need to register their systems and meet risk and quality management obligations to gain access to the EU market.\nAnother category of AI apps, such as chatbots, are considered \u201climited risk\u201d and subject to lighter transparency obligations.\nThe EU started rolling out the AI Act last year in a staggered fashion, with the full rules coming into force by mid-2026.\n\ntitle3:\nReady-made stem cell therapies for pets could be coming\ndescription3:\nEarlier this week, San Diego startup Gallant announced $18 million in funding to bring the first FDA-approved ready-to-use stem cell therapy to veterinary medicine. If it passes regulatory muster, it could create a whole new way to treat our fur babies.\nIt\u2019s still an experimental field, even though people have been researching stem cells for humans for decades. Seven-year-old Gallant\u2019s first target is a painful mouth condition in cats called Feline Chronic Gingivostomatitis (FCGS), which Gallant says could receive FDA approval by early 2026.\nThe field has shown some encouraging early results. Studies on dogs with arthritis showed improvements in pain and mobility, with some benefits lasting up to two years. But when researchers tried similar treatments for kidney disease in cats \u2014 that\u2019s another condition Gallant wants to tackle \u2014 the results were more mixed.\nWhat makes Gallant\u2019s approach different is convenience. Most stem cell treatments today require harvesting cells from the patient or donors with matching tissue, whereas Gallant\u2019s therapy uses ready-to-use cells from donor animals, even if they are a different species.\nInvestors clearly see potential here. The funding round was led by existing backer Digitalis Ventures, with participation from NovaQuest Capital Management, which previously invested in the first FDA-approved human stem cell therapy.\nThe company has an interesting backstory. Gallant\u2019s founder, Aaron Hirschhorn, previously sold DogVacay to its biggest rival in the dog-sitting marketplace, Rover. Hirschhorn passed away in 2021; Gallant is now led by Linda Black, who joined as its president and chief scientific officer from nearly the beginning. Gallant has now raised at least $44 million altogether from investors.\"\n\nResponse:",
