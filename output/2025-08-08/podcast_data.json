Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

And, as Altman pointed out, one area where it is undoubtedly competing well is price. \u201cVery happy with the pricing we are able to deliver!\u201d he tweeted.\nThe top-level GPT-5 API costs $1.25 per 1 million tokens of input, and $10 per 1 million tokens for output (plus $0.125 per 1 million tokens for cached input). This pricing mirrors Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro basic subscription, which is also popular for coding-related tasks. Google, however, charges more if inputs/outputs cross a heavy threshold of 200,000 prompts, meaning its most consumption-heavy customers end up paying more.\nBut OpenAI is really undercutting Anthropic\u2019s Claude Opus 4.1, which starts at $15 per 1 million input tokens and $75 per 1 million output tokens. (Anthropic does, however, offer big discounts for prompt caching and batch processing \u2014 storing/reusing prompts and processing multiple requests together.)\nAnthropic\u2019s model has been extremely popular among programmers, both as a choice within popular coding assistant Cursor and for powering its own such assistant, Claude Code. (Note that Cursor offered GPT-5 as an option minutes after it was announced.)\nDevelopers who have had early access to GPT-5 are touting the pricing. Simon Willison, one of the developers featured in OpenAI\u2019s launch video, writes in his review: \u201cThe pricing is aggressively competitive with other providers.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBut GPT-5 is also priced competitively with GPT-4o. OthersideAI\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Matt Shumer (maker of HyperWrite), writes that GPT-5 \u201cis cheaper than GPT-4o, which is fantastic. Intelligence per dollar continues to increase.\u201d\nSome on X called OpenAI\u2019s fees for the model \u201ca pricing killer,\u201d while others on Hacker News are offering similar praise.\nWill competitors like Anthropic follow? Will Google \u2014 who undercut OpenAI on pricing before \u2014 get even more affordable? If so, we could be witnessing the start of a much-awaited LLM price war.\nThere\u2019s no doubt a price war would be welcome. The underlying economics of vibe-coding tool providers, for instance, is pretty shaky because of the high and unpredictable fees they have to pay model makers, as TechCrunch\u2019s Marina Temkin reports. And there are countless startups building on top of AI models as well.\nSilicon Valley has been hoping that the LLM price-to-performance ratio will eventually improve, along with inference costs. But it seemed like such an equalization could be years away as the tech industry invests hundreds of billions to build data centers and infrastructure to support growing AI demand.\nOpenAI itself has a $30 billion-per-year contract with Oracle for capacity, when it only recently hit annual recurring revenue of $10 billion. Meanwhile, Meta plans to spend up to $72 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, and Alphabet has set aside $85 billion for capital expenditures in 2025, driven by AI needs. In the face of such enormous expenses, costs typically go one way: up.\nGiven such investments, it may be too soon for startups looking at their rising model API bills to rejoice from OpenAI\u2019s lone move to lower pricing.\nYet this week, OpenAI threw down the gauntlet to put pressure on prices not just once but twice. We\u2019ll see if others follow.\n\ntitle1:\nSam Altman addresses \u2018bumpy\u2019 GPT-5 rollout, bringing 4o back, and the \u2018chart crime\u2019\ndescription1:\nDuring a Reddit ask-me-anything session on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and key members of the GPT-5 team were peppered with questions about the new model and requests to bring back its previous model, GPT-4o.\nThey also asked Altman about the most embarrassing \u2014 and perhaps funniest \u2014 snafu in the presentation, the \u201cchart crime.\u201d\nOne of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out is a real-time router that decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to \u201cthink\u201d through answers.\nBut multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn\u2019t working as well for them as 4o did. Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed \u201cdumber\u201d was the router wasn\u2019t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday.\n\u201cGPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,\u201d Altman promised.\nStill, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote.\nAnd Altman also promised, \u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.\u201d This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nPredictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many \u201cchart crime\u201d jokes. The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar.\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 \u201cchart crime.\u201d Image Credits:OpenAI\nAltman didn\u2019t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a \u201cmega chart screwup\u201d on X. Others noted the charts in the published blog post were correct.\nBut the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model\u2019s performance, also pointed out that turning data into a table was \u201cgood example of a GPT-5 failure.\u201d\nIn any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most. He ended the AMA with a promise: \u201cWe will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nMeta acquires AI audio startup WaveForms\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nMeta has acquired AI voice startup WaveForms for an undisclosed sum, The Information reports. It\u2019s the company\u2019s latest buy to strengthen its new AI unit, Superintelligence Labs, and Meta\u2019s second major AI audio acquisition in the last month after it bought PlayAI.\nWaveForms, founded just eight months ago, raised $40 million from Andreessen Horowitz in a round that valued the company at $160 million pre-money, per PitchBook data.\nTwo of the startup\u2019s co-founders \u2014 former Meta and OpenAI researcher Alexis Conneau, and former Google advertising strategist Coralie Lemaitre \u2014 have reportedly joined Meta. While at OpenAI, Conneau co-created GPT4-o Advanced Voice Mode neural networks.\nTechCrunch has reached out to WaveForms to find out whether its chief technologist, Kartikay Khandelwal, will also join Meta, as well as the outcome of the deal for the roughly 14 other staffers (per LinkedIn) at the company.\nWaveForms appears to have taken down its own website, but the company\u2019s LinkedIn page describes its mission as solving the \u201cSpeech Turing Test,\u201d which tries to measure if a listener can distinguish between human and AI-generated speech. WaveForms was also developing \u201cEmotional General Intelligence,\u201d which focuses on understanding individual self-awareness and management.\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated Khandelwal\u2019s role at WaveForms.\n\ntitle3:\nNASA and Google are building an AI medical assistant to keep Mars-bound astronauts healthy\ndescription3:\nAs human-spaceflight missions grow longer and travel farther from Earth, keeping crews healthy gets more challenging.\nAstronauts on the International Space Station can depend on real-time calls to Houston, regular cargo deliveries of medicines, and a quick ride home after six months. All of that may soon change as NASA and its commercial partners, like Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, look to conduct longer-duration missions that would take humans to the moon and Mars.\nThat looming reality is pushing NASA to gradually make on-orbit medical care more \u201cEarth-independent.\u201d One early experiment is a proof-of-concept AI medical assistant the agency is building with Google. The tool, called Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant (CMO-DA), is designed to help astronauts diagnose and treat symptoms when no doctor is available or communications to Earth are blacked out.\nThe multimodal tool, which includes speech, text, and images, runs inside Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI environment.\nThe project is operating under a fixed-price Google Public Sector subscription agreement, which includes the cost for cloud services, the application development infrastructure, and model training, David Cruley, customer engineer at Google\u2019s Public Sector business unit, told TechCrunch. NASA owns the source code to the app and has helped fine-tune the models. The Google Vertex AI platform provides access to models from Google and other third parties.\nThe two organizations have put CMO-DA through three scenarios: an ankle injury, flank pain, and ear pain. A trio of physicians, one being an astronaut, graded the assistant\u2019s performance across the initial evaluation, history-taking, clinical reasoning, and treatment.\nThe trio found a high degree of diagnostic accuracy, judging the flank pain evaluation and treatment plan to be 74% likely correct; ear pain, 80%; and 88% for the ankle injury.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

NASA scientists said in a slide deck that they are planning on adding more data sources, like medical devices, and training the model to be \u201csituationally aware\u201d \u2014 that is, attuned to space medicine-specific conditions like microgravity.\nCruley was vague about whether Google intends to pursue regulatory clearance to take this type of medical assistant into doctor\u2019s offices here on Earth, but it could be an obvious next step if the model is validated on orbit.\nThe tool not only could improve the health of astronauts in space, \u201cbut the lessons learned from this tool could also have applicability to other areas of health,\u201d he said.\n\ntitle4:\nSoftBank reportedly bought Foxconn's Ohio factory for the Stargate AI project\ndescription4:\nThe mystery buyer of the former General Motors factory owned by Foxconn in Lordstown, Ohio, is apparently SoftBank, according to Bloomberg News. SoftBank wants to use the factory to build AI servers as part of the Stargate data center project being spearheaded by the Japanese conglomerate, OpenAI, and Oracle.\nThe report comes just a few days after Foxconn announced it had sold the factory, along with electric vehicle manufacturing equipment that was inside of it, to a buyer it only referred to as \u201cCrescent Dune LLC\u201d \u2014 an entity that was created in Delaware in late July. Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment.\nIt\u2019s unclear what this means for Monarch Tractor, a California-based startup that develops electric and autonomous farm equipment. Monarch was the lone customer of Foxconn\u2019s contract manufacturing operation at the Ohio factory, after the other three of the Taiwanese tech giant\u2019s prospective customers went bankrupt. Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa has not responded to emailed requests for comment.\nSoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle announced the Stargate project one day after Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. The effort currently involves a large data center that is being built in Texas, but the companies involved have said they want to build infrastructure in other states and countries. In May, Bloomberg reported that SoftBank was struggling to line up funding for the project and that it was already being hampered by Trump\u2019s myriad trade wars.\nFoxconn bought the factory in late 2021 from electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said his company wanted to develop the site into the \u201cmost important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.\u201d\nThe sale closed in 2022 and, one year later, Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy. Prospective customers like Fisker Inc. and California startup IndiEV also went out of business.\"\n\nResponse:",
