Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

Solar is cheap and quick to build, and as a result, it has become a go-to power source for tech companies as their data center fleets multiply in size.\nMeta yesterday announced two agreements in Louisiana that see it buying the environmental attributes of a combined 385 megawatts of electricity. Both projects are expected to be completed two years from now.\nThey follow on the heels of a larger deal announced Monday in which Meta bought 600 megawatts from a massive solar farm near Lubbock, Texas. The project will also start commercial operations in 2027.\nWhile the Texas power plant won\u2019t connect directly to Meta data centers, it will feed into the local grid, offsetting use by the facilities.\nThe Louisiana deals, though, involve purchasing of certificates that allow Meta to offset its carbon-intensive sources of power.\nSuch environmental attribute certificates (EACs), sometimes called renewable energy certificates, have been criticized by experts for obscuring the true carbon footprint of tech companies\u2019 operations, which have ballooned as AI has driven up electricity use.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

They let anyone buy the electricity, but also gave companies an option to pay extra to offset their own emissions \u2014 and offset the higher costs of renewable power. They helped encourage developers to build more renewable projects.\nBut the cost of new solar and wind has dropped dramatically since then, with renewables undercutting new fossil power and sometimes existing coal and natural gas power plants. EACs don\u2019t provide the same incentive as before, and experts question how much additional renewable power they stimulate.\nIf companies truly want to offset their new energy use from AI, they should be encouraging developers to build new renewable capacity, experts argue.\n\ntitle2:\nEverything you need to know about the AI chatbot\ndescription2:\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it\u2019s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year.

Personal data has to be accurate,\u201d said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn\u2019t enough. You can\u2019t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\u201d\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \u201cgpt-4o-mini-tts,\u201d that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \u201cgpt-4o-transcribe\u201d and \u201cgpt-4o-mini-transcribe\u201d. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model to deliver \u201cconsistently better responses.\u201d It\u2019s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI \u201creasoning\u201d models could\u2019ve arrived decades ago\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \u201creasoning\u201d could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \u201cnew model\u201d that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \u201cPlease write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\u201d OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\nwe trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.\nPROMPT:\nPlease write a metafictional literary short story\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI \u2018agents\u2019\nOpenAI intends to release several \u201cagent\u201d products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \u201chigh-income knowledge worker\u201d agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \u201cPhD-level research,\u201d are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It\u2019s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\nChatGPT can directly edit your code\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\nChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities.

That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\nThis story is continually updated with new information.\n\ntitle3:\nBluesky hits 40 million users, introduces 'dislikes' beta\ndescription3:\nSocial network Bluesky, which on Friday announced a new milestone of 40 million users, will soon start testing \u201cdislikes\u201d as a way to improve personalization on its main Discover feed and others.\nThe news was shared alongside a host of other conversation control updates and changes, which include smaller tweaks to replies, improved detection of toxic comments, and other ways to prioritize more relevant conversations to the individual user.\nWith the \u201cdislikes\u201d beta rolling out soon, Bluesky will take into account the new signal to improve user personalization. As users \u201cdislike\u201d posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of. This will help to inform more than just how content is ranked in feeds, but also reply rankings.\nThe company explained the changes are designed to make Bluesky a place for more \u201cfun, genuine, and respectful exchanges\u201d \u2014 an edict that follows a month of unrest on the platform as some users again criticized the platform over its moderation decisions. While Bluesky is designed as a decentralized network where users run their own moderation, some subset of Bluesky users want the platform itself to ban bad actors and controversial figures instead of leaving it up to the users to block them.\nBluesky, however, wants to focus more on the tools it provides users to control their own experience.\nToday, this includes things like moderation lists that let users quickly block a group of people they don\u2019t want to interact with, content filter controls, muted words, and the ability to subscribe to other moderation service providers. Bluesky also lets users detach quote posts to limit unwanted attention, which has long influenced the toxic culture of \u201cdunking\u201d on X (formerly Twitter).\nIn addition to dislikes, the company says it\u2019s testing a mix of ranking updates, design changes, and other feedback tools to improve the conversations on its network.\nThis includes a new system that will map out the \u201csocial neighborhoods\u201d on Bluesky, meaning the connections between people who often interact and reply to one another. Bluesky says it\u2019s prioritizing replies from people \u201ccloser to your neighborhood,\u201d to make conversations you\u2019re shown in your feed more relevant and familiar. The new \u201cdislikes\u201d may have some influence here, as well, Bluesky says.\nThis, in particular, is an area where competitor Threads, from Meta, has been challenged at times.\nAs newsletter writer Max Read noted last year, Threads tended to land its users in a confusing feed where conversations they weren\u2019t connected to would appear, sometimes in mid-story. Read remarked that \u201cit\u2019s often impossible to figure out who is replying to whom and where and why you\u2019re seeing certain posts. They appear from nowhere and lead to nowhere,\u201d he wrote at the time.\nBluesky\u2019s plan to map out social neighborhoods could address this issue as it scales.\nThe company also said its latest model does a better job at detecting replies that are \u201ctoxic, spammy, off-topic, or posted in bad faith,\u201d and downranks these in threads, search results, and notifications.\nAnother change to the Reply button will now take users to the full thread instead of straight into the compose screen, which may encourage users to read the thread before responding.\nThis, says Bluesky, is a simple way to \u201creduce content collapse and redundant replies\u201d \u2014 another criticism that tends to be levied at Twitter/X.\nPlus, the company is tweaking the reply settings feature to make it more visible to users that they can control who is allowed to respond to their posts.\n\ntitle4:\nHackers threaten to leak data after breaching University of Pennsylvania to send mass emails\ndescription4:\nOn Friday morning, University of Pennsylvania alumni, students, staff, and community affiliates received several emails from hackers purporting to represent the university\u2019s Graduate School of Education (GSE).\n\u201cWe have terrible security practices and are completely unmeritocratic,\u201d read the email. \u201cWe love breaking federal rules like FERPA (all your data will be leaked).\u201d\nA partially redacted email sent by hackers with access to the university of Pennsylvania email system. Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\nThis message was sent from a variety of different Penn-affiliated email accounts, such as the GSE, as well as purporting to come from several senior members of staff across the university.\nOther Penn affiliates have received the email multiple times from different senders with official @upenn.edu email addresses. (Disclosure: As an alumna and former employee of the university, I have received the message three times thus far to my personal email.)\nPenn spokesperson Ron Ozio told TechCrunch in an email on Friday that the school\u2019s incident response team is \u201cactively addressing\u201d the situation.\n\u201cA fraudulent email has been circulated that appears to come from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Graduate School of Education. This is obviously a fake, and nothing in the highly offensive, hurtful message reflects the mission or actions of Penn or of Penn GSE,\u201d Ozio said.\nAs the hackers plainly stated in their message (\u201cPlease stop giving us money\u201d), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. The breach also comes soon after the university publicly rebuffed the White House\u2019s offer to make commitments aligned with the Trump administration\u2019s political agenda in exchange for federal funding. Penn and six other schools have rejected the White House\u2019s proposal.\nThe White House\u2019s \u201cCompact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education\u201d asks universities to abolish affirmative action in hiring and admissions, and to discipline departments that \u201cpurposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.\u201d\nCompact signatories would also be required to freeze tuition for five years, offer tuition-free education to students pursuing \u201chard sciences,\u201d cap international undergrad enrollment at 15%, and require standardized tests like the SAT for admission.\nThe compact also mandates that schools enforce policies that marginalize transgender and gender non-conforming students.\n\u201c[The compact] preferences and mandates protections for the communication of conservative thought alone,\u201d wrote Penn president J. Larry Jameson in his response to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, which was published on the university\u2019s website.\n\u201cOne-sided conditions conflict with the viewpoint diversity and freedom of expression that are central to how universities contribute to democracy and to society,\u201d wrote Jameson.\"\n\nResponse:",
