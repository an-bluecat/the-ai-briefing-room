It was led by Felicis and included a who\u2019s who of angels and other top VCs.\nThe startup began when Fedus had a conversation with Cubuk (whose friends call him \u201cDoge\u201d) about seven months ago. Cubuk was one of Google Brain\u2019s foremost machine learning and material science researchers. After endless Silicon Valley takes on how generative AI would radically change scientific discovery, they decided that the pieces were finally in place to make this a reality. Or at least to found a startup that attempted it.\n\u201cThere are a few things that happened in the LLM field, in experimental science and in simulations that kind of made this the right time,\u201d Cubuk told TechCrunch.\nFor one, he said, robotic arms that could handle powder synthesis \u2014 the process of mixing and creating new materials \u2014 had recently proved themselves reliable. For another, machine learning simulations had become efficient and accurate enough to model complex physical systems such as those needed to develop new materials.\nAnd, third, LLMs now had powerful reasoning capabilities \u2014 in part through the work of Fedus and his team at OpenAI. Fedus was one of the small team that created ChatGPT to begin with and was running OpenAI\u2019s uber-important post-training team, which refines models after their initial development.\nStitched together, the picture was clear: A simulation could theoretically discover new compounds, a robot could mix the materials, and an LLM could analyze the results and suggest course corrections. AI-automated material science was ready to be built.\nIn fact, Cubuk was one of the researchers who published a groundbreaking paper in 2023 documenting a precursor Google research project. The team built a fully automated, robotic-powered lab and created 41 novel compounds from recipes suggested by language models.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nEqually importantly, the founders realized that even failed experiments would be valuable for their new startup because data is the lifeblood of AI. AI science offered an entirely new source for real-world training and post-training data. This could, the founders believe, turn the existing scientific motivation system on its head, which seeks success, not exploration, rewarded via paper publication and grants.\n\u201cMaking contact with reality, bringing experiments into the [AI] loop \u2014 we feel like this is the next frontier,\u201d Fedus told TechCrunch.\nFelicis wins the deal; OpenAI does not invest\nAfter that discussion with Cubuk, Fedus went to the powers that be at OpenAI to share his resignation and his plan. He then gleefully tweeted to the world that he was leaving with what appeared to be OpenAI\u2019s blessing and investment.\nThis is what I sent to my colleagues at OpenAI:\nHi all, I made the difficult decision to leave OpenAI as an employee, but I\u2019m looking to work closely together as a partner going forward. Contributing to the mission of OpenAI and working with world-class teams to create and\u2026 \u2014 William Fedus (@LiamFedus) March 17, 2025\nThat investment didn\u2019t actually materialize, however. OpenAI is not a backer of Periodic, the founders confirmed to TechCrunch. And while Fedus declined to say why, they actually didn\u2019t need OpenAI\u2019s money.\nFedus\u2019 tweet set off a frenzy of VCs courting the company. \u201cThere was almost like a feeling of being reverse pitched. One investor actually wrote a love letter to Periodic Labs,\u201d Fedus laughed, explaining that neither he nor Cubuk \u201cknew what to make of it.\u201d Others sent multi-page documents pitching themselves.\nBut the first call that they actually took was from Peter Deng, a former OpenAI colleague turned investor for top-tier seed firm Felicis. (Deng left OpenAI for Felicis at the start of 2025.)\n\u201cLiam is a very big deal within OpenAI, very well loved and an extremely impactful researcher,\u201d Deng told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen I heard he left, I texted him immediately.\u201d\nDeng met Fedus for coffee in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. Hyped on caffeine and enthusiasm, Fedus invited Deng to finish their conversation on a walk over the area\u2019s famously hilly terrain. Pitch walks may be a Silicon Valley trope, but they also really happen.\nThe chilly day had turned hot. Deng, wearing a sweater, sweated and scrambled to keep up with the fit and friendly Fedus until the founder said something that \u201cliterally stopped me in my tracks,\u201d Deng told TechCrunch. He told Deng that \u201ceveryone talks about doing science, but in order to do science, you actually have to do science,\u201d Deng recalls.\nIn other words, they needed to give AI a fully equipped wet lab to try its ideas in a real-world, controlled setting.\n\u201cThe truth about these models is that everything that the models know is within normal distribution. We take a bunch of data, and it can just regurgitate what it knows,\u201d Deng said.\nDiscovering something new has to involve testing hypotheses.\n\u201cAnd I committed on the spot, in the middle of the hills of Noe Valley, to write the check,\u201d Deng says.\nFedus also remembers the moment Deng asked how he could be involved, and Fedus told him the startup needed cash for laptops and a temporary office. And \u201che\u2019s like, great, I\u2019ll give you money right now. And it was just this huge vote of confidence.\u201d\nBut Deng didn\u2019t actually whip out his checkbook on the street. He went back to the office elated over the deal only to encounter Felicis\u2019 lawyer, who pointed out that the firm couldn\u2019t promptly sign a contract: The company wasn\u2019t incorporated yet. It didn\u2019t even have a name, much less a bank account to wire funds. \u201cThat\u2019s how early we were.\u201d Deng grinned.\nSoon they had all of those things and all the term sheets they could handle. With the $300 million war chest, Cubuk and Fedus hired over two dozen of the most prestigious AI and scientific talent like Alexandre Passos (a creator of o1 and o3); Eric Toberer (a materials scientist who has already made key superconductor discoveries); and Matt Horton, a creator of two of Microsoft\u2019s GenAI materials science tools. And the list goes on.\nBecause the team members are all experts in different areas, from AI to physics, each week one of them gives a grad-level lecture to the others. \u201cWe do feel like a tight coupling is extremely important,\u201d Cubuk said. He wants everyone to understand all parts of what they are building.\nPeriodic Labs has already set up its lab, too, and is working with experimental data, simulations and testing some predictions. The main initial mission is to find new superconductor materials \u2014 potentially a gold mine discovery. Improved superconductors could power the next era of potent, but lower energy-consuming tech.\nBut the last part \u2014 the robots \u2014 are not yet up and running. \u201cThey will take a bit to train,\u201d Cubuk said.\nAll of this is, of course, a big swing for the fences. AI powered or not, scientific discovery is not typically fast, easy, or predictable. While this team of experts has some indications that they will find what they are looking for \u2014 or make other discoveries along the way (or simply generate valuable data on their failures), there\u2019s no guarantees.\nAnd we know that model makers themselves are inching their way toward more AI science. Last month, OpenAI VP Kevin Weil said he was launching an OpenAI for Science unit at the company to \u201cbuild the next great scientific instrument: an AI-powered platform that accelerates scientific discovery.\u201d\nAs for the investor who wrote the love letter, he didn\u2019t win the deal (although Fedus did say that the letter was \u201cvery flattering.\u201d) The other seed investors include Andreessen Horowitz, DST, Nvidia\u2019s venture capital arm NVentures, Accel, and angel backers like Jeff Bezos, Elad Gil, Eric Schmidt, and Jeff Dean.\nElad Gil will be speaking about how AI has changed the startup landscape at Disrupt in San Francisco on October 29.\n\ntitle1:\nUS and Australia sign $3B critical minerals deal\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nPresident Donald Trump and Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese inked an agreement on Monday that will pump billions of dollars into critical minerals projects.\nThe U.S. and Australia will together contribute $3 billion to the projects over the next six months. The total project pipeline is worth $8.5 billion, the governments said.\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. Department of Defense will also invest in a gallium refinery in Western Australia capable of producing 100 tons per year. Currently, the U.S. imports approximately 21 tons of gallium, which represents 100% of domestic consumption, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nThe move comes as China has restricted exports of certain minerals, including rare earth elements, that are vital to the production of electronics and electric motors. Gallium, for example, is used in microwave circuits and blue and violet LEDs, which can be used to make powerful lasers.\nAlongside the critical minerals deal, Australia has agreed to buy $1.2 billion worth of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) from defense startup Anduril. The White House did not specify whether the purchase agreement is new or part of a previously announced $1.12 billion program under which Anduril will deliver a fleet of Ghost Shark AUVs to the Australian Navy. That deal was announced in September.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta AI's app downloads and daily users spiked after launch of 'Vibes' AI video feed\ndescription2:\nNew data indicates that use of Meta AI\u2019s mobile app for iOS and Android has seen a significant increase. According to a new analysis from market intelligence provider Similarweb, the app\u2019s daily active users across both platforms jumped to 2.7 million as of October 17, up from around 775,000 just four weeks ago. In addition, Meta AI\u2019s app installs are also up, reaching 300,000 new downloads per day, compared with under 200,000 daily downloads a few weeks ago.\nFor comparison, Meta AI\u2019s app had just 4,000 daily downloads a year ago, on October 17, 2024.\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nThe firm says it hasn\u2019t seen any meaningful correlation in either search or advertising estimates, but notes Meta could be running Facebook or Instagram promotions that wouldn\u2019t be captured in its model.\nHowever, there\u2019s also another possible explanation for the sharp rise: the launch of Meta\u2019s new Vibes feed in September, which introduced short-form AI-generated videos to the Meta AI mobile app.\nMeta AI introduced the Vibes feed on September 25, which correlates with the sharp increase in the app\u2019s daily active users on iOS and Android, as seen in the chart below.\nImage Credits:Similarweb\nRecently, OpenAI\u2019s video generator Sora drew headlines as its app reached the top of the App Store when users rushed to try the new technology. However, Meta AI could have benefited from this launch as well. While Similarweb says its data doesn\u2019t prove cause and effect, it\u2019s possible that the attention to Sora drove some people to try Meta AI, in order to compare the two experiences.\nAnother possibility is that Meta could be benefiting from Sora\u2019s invite-only status. That is, those who couldn\u2019t try out the OpenAI app may have looked for an alternative to experiment with. This would be an interesting explanation, too, as it suggests that OpenAI\u2019s decision to gatekeep Sora may have directly boosted its rivals.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Verified medical professionals can access OpenEvidence\u2019s tool, which is supported by advertising, for free.\nOpenEvidence has grown quickly since its founding in 2022. Its number of clinical consultations per month has nearly doubled to 15 million since July, per the Times.\nThe round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Thrive Capital, Coatue Management, Bond, and Craft.\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenEvidence for comment.\n\ntitle4:\nApple will let users roll back the Liquid Glass look with new 'tinted' option\ndescription4:\nApple has rolled out a new feature that makes it easier to customize Liquid Glass to your liking. Now users will be able to set the appearance of Liquid Glass to either Clear or Tinted, with the help of a new setting included in the latest beta update of its mobile and desktop operating systems.\nThe addition indicates Apple is listening closely to user feedback in these early days of the iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS 26 public launches. Apples likes to push through more significant changes, but it will often offer a fallback option for those who have a hard time adjusting.\nThat was the case when Apple moved Safari\u2019s address to the bottom of the screen in 2021. After some user backlash over the then controversial decision, the iPhone maker added an option to revert the bar to the top of the screen. (Apple, we\u2019ll concede, was right to make the move; the bar\u2019s location is better when it\u2019s in easier reach of your thumbs.)\nNow Apple is taking a similar approach with Liquid Glass.\nThe new user interface that shipped with iOS 26 and other Apple operating systems was the company\u2019s biggest design overhaul since its move from a skeuomorphic to flat design back in 2013. As with most changes of this scale and significance, not everybody has been on board.\nSome have said the Liquid Glass design makes various parts of the interface harder to read, including notifications or navigation controls in apps like Apple Music and others. Others have said they love Liquid Glass\u2019s attention to detail and its new look, which felt like a more modern update to an interface that had grown stale over the years.\nWith another potential divisive response on its hands, Apple is now ceding some control over Liquid Glass\u2019s appearance back to the users.\nTechcrunch event 2-FOR-1 DISCOUNT: Bring a +1 and save 60% Google Cloud, Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
