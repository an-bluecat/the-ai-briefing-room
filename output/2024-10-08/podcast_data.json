The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Without quantifying an exact number, the EPA said some have \"alarming cybersecurity vulnerabilities\" \u2014 default passwords that have not been updated, vulnerable single login setups and former employees who retained systems access.\nAmerican Water said it first learned of the unauthorized computer access on October 3, and was subsequently able to determine it was a cyberattack. It said turning off customer systems was intended to protect data, though it added that it is too soon to know whether any customer information is at risk.\nAn American Water spokesman declined to comment beyond the official security statement.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI announces content deal with Hearst\ndescription1:\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, attends the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 18, 2024.\nOpenAI announced a partnership with Hearst, the media conglomerate behind outlets like the Houston Chronicle, the San Francisco Chronicle, Esquire, Cosmopolitan, Elle and others.\nUnder the partnership, OpenAI's products, such as ChatGPT and SearchGPT, will be able to display content from more than 20 magazine brands and more than 40 newspapers, the company's announced on Tuesday.\n\"Our partnership with OpenAI will help us evolve the future of magazine content,\" Hearst Magazines President Debi Chirichella said in a statement.\nAs part of the agreement, Hearst content in ChatGPT will include appropriate citations and link users to the original Hearst sources, the media company said in the announcement. Heart's non-magazine and newspaper businesses will not be included in the partnership.\nThe deal is the latest in a recent trend of media outlets entering into content partnerships with AI startups.\nOpenAI announced a similar partnership in August with Cond\u00e9 Nast, which owns media brands such as Vogue, The New Yorker, GQ, Vanity Fair and Wired.\nPerplexity AI debuted a revenue-sharing model for publishers in July following more than a month of plagiarism accusations. Media outlets and content platforms including Fortune, Time, Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, Der Spiegel and WordPress.com were the first to join Perplexity AI's \"Publishers Program.\"\nOpenAI and Time announced a \"multi-year content deal\" in June that will allow OpenAI to access current and archived articles from more than 100 years of the magazine's history. OpenAI will be able to display Time's content within its ChatGPT chatbot in response to user questions, according to the magazine, and use Time's content \"to enhance its products,\" or, likely, to train its AI models.\nIn May, OpenAI announced a partnership with News Corp., allowing OpenAI to access current and archived articles from The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Barron's, the New York Post and other publications. Reddit also announced a deal with OpenAI in May to allow the ChatGPT maker to train its AI models on the social media company's content.\nOther news publications and media outlets are aggressively trying to protect their businesses as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent.\nThe Center for Investigative Reporting, the country's oldest nonprofit newsroom, sued OpenAI and its lead backer Microsoft in federal court in June for alleged copyright infringement, following similar suits from publications including The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News.\nThe New York Times in December filed a suit against Microsoft and OpenAI, alleging intellectual property violations related to its journalistic content appearing in ChatGPT training data. The newspaper said it seeks to hold Microsoft and OpenAI accountable for \"billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages\" related to the \"unlawful copying and use of the Times's uniquely valuable works,\" according to a filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. OpenAI disagreed with the publication's characterization of events.\nWATCH: OpenAI COO breaks down Apple partnership, new AI models\n\ntitle2:\nFei-Fei Li picks Google Cloud, where she led AI, as World Labs' main compute provider\ndescription2:\nCloud providers are chasing after AI unicorns, and the latest is Fei-Fei Li\u2019s World Labs. The startup just tapped Google Cloud as its primary compute provider to train AI models, a deal that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But Li\u2019s tenure as chief scientist of AI at Google Cloud wasn\u2019t a factor, the company says.\nDuring the Google Cloud Startup Summit on Tuesday, the companies announced World Labs will use a large chunk of its funding to license GPU servers on the Google Cloud Platform, and ultimately train \u201cspatially intelligent\u201d AI models.\nA handful of well-funded startups building AI foundation models are highly sought after in the cloud services world. Some of the largest deals include OpenAI, which exclusively trains and runs AI models on Microsoft Azure, and Anthropic, which uses AWS and Google Cloud. These companies regularly pay millions of dollars for computing services, and could one day need even more as their AI models scale. That makes them valuable customers for Google, Microsoft, and AWS to build relationships with early on.\nWorld Labs is certainly building unique, multimodal AI models with significant compute needs. The startup just raised $230 million at more than a billion-dollar valuation, a deal led by A16Z, in order to build AI world models. General manager of startups and AI at Google Cloud, James Lee, tells TechCrunch that World Labs\u2019 AI models will one day be able to process, generate, and interact with video and geospatial data. World Labs calls these AI models \u201cspatial intelligence.\u201d\nLi has deep ties with Google Cloud, having led the company\u2019s AI efforts in 2018. However, Google denies that this deal is a product of that relationship, and rejects the idea that cloud services are just commodities. Instead, Lee said services, such as its High Performance Toolkit to scale AI workloads, and its deep supply of AI chips were a larger factor.\n\u201cFei-Fei is obviously a friend of GCP,\u201d said Lee in an interview. \u201cGCP wasn\u2019t the only option they looked at. But for all the reasons we talked about \u2013 our AI optimized infrastructure and the ability to meet their scalability needs \u2013 ultimately they came to us.\u201d\nGoogle Cloud offers AI startups a choice between its proprietary AI chips, tensor processing units or TPUs, and Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, which Google purchases and has a more limited supply of. Google Cloud is trying to get more startups to train AI models on TPUs, largely as a means to reduce its dependency on Nvidia. All cloud providers are limited today by the scarcity of Nvidia GPUs, so many are building their own AI chips to meet demand. Google Cloud says some startups are training and inferencing solely on TPUs, however, GPUs still remain the industry\u2019s favorite AI training chip.\nWorld Labs chose to train its AI models on GPUs in this deal. However, Google Cloud wouldn\u2019t say what went into that decision.\n\u201cWe worked with Fei-Fei and her product team, and at this stage of their product roadmap, it made more sense for them to work with us on the GPU platform,\u201d said Lee in an interview. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a permanent decision\u2026 Sometimes [startups] move onto different platforms, such as TPUs.\u201d\nLee would not disclose how large World Labs\u2019 GPU cluster is, but cloud providers often dedicate massive supercomputers for startups training AI models. Google Cloud promised another startup training AI foundation models, Magic, a cluster with \u201ctens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs,\u201d each of which has more power than a high-end gaming PC.\nThese clusters are easier to promise than they are to fulfill. Google\u2019s cloud services competitor Microsoft is reportedly struggling to meet the insane compute demands of OpenAI, forcing the startup to tap other options for computing power.\nWorld Labs\u2019 deal with Google Cloud is not exclusive, meaning the startup may still strike deals with other cloud providers. However, Google Cloud hosts the majority of World Labs\u2019 workloads today, and says it will try to maintain that business moving forward.\n\ntitle3:\nTesla Robotaxi reveal: What to expect\ndescription3:\nTesla is gearing up to reveal its Robotaxi this Thursday, and everyone wants to know what it will look like, whether Tesla will unveil a commercialization strategy, and what outrageous timelines Elon Musk might announce to bump Tesla\u2019s stock.\nThe \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event will take place at 7 p.m. PT at Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s movie studio in Burbank, California, and we\u2019ve got details on how to watch it here.\nMusk had originally planned to reveal the Robotaxi \u2013 which he has also referred to as a Cybercab \u2013 on August 8. That\u2019s a deadline Musk set for himself and Tesla a few hours after a Reuters report found that the automaker shelved its plan to build a lower-cost EV and would instead focus its resources on a robotaxi.\nWhile Musk initially accused Reuters of lying, over the next couple of weeks, Tesla indeed laid off 10% of staff to usher in a \u201cnext phase of growth,\u201d and Musk said Tesla would be going \u201cballs to the wall for autonomy.\u201d\nTesla has seldom stuck to Musk\u2019s timelines, and as expected, this Robotaxi event ended up getting pushed back to October after Musk requested \u201can important design change to the front.\u201d\nInvestors who have backed Tesla\u2019s vision for autonomy have been waiting for Tesla to finally reveal a Robotaxi. But the timing might not be great. Tesla\u2019s margins have taken a hit over the past year or so due to ramped up Cybertruck production, among other factors. Its third-quarter deliveries were somewhat disappointing, and Tesla has issued its fifth Cybertruck recall within a year of launching the vehicle.\nA new vehicle would mean more investment into production lines, factory downtime, and other potentially costly issues \u2013 things investors don\u2019t love to hear about.\nWhether it\u2019s all hype or at least some substance, we will soon find out. But here\u2019s what we expect to see.\nA Cybercab prototype\nImage Credits:Elon Musk biography by Walter Isaacson\nThe main thing we expect to see is a prototype for a new vehicle concept, which will be Tesla\u2019s first since it announced the Cybertruck back in November 2019.\nMusk has referred to the robotaxi as a Cybercab, which seems to confirm the design concept revealed last year in Walter Isaacson\u2019s biography of the executive \u2013 a two-door, two-seater, Cybertruck-like compact vehicle, complete with angular edges and a stainless steel finish.\nThe vehicle will also likely be built without a steering wheel or pedals. While Tesla engineers have advocated against this at launch, Musk has been firm in his desire to bring a purpose-built vehicle to market, per Isaacson\u2019s book.\nTesla may run up against regulatory issues for that design choice, which don\u2019t align with federal motor safety standards, and we partly expect Musk to use that as a reason why getting the Cybercab to market will be difficult.\nSmoke and mirrors\nWarner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 2, 2023. Warner Bros Discovery Inc. released earnings figures on Aug. 3. Photographer: Eric Thayer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Image Credits:Getty Images\nTesla usually hosts its big reveal events at one of its facilities, so the Hollywood studio choice is a step-change that signals Musk\u2019s showmanship will be on display.\nThe studio in question is open to the public for tours, so visitors (who are mainly Tesla shareholders and superfans) will get the chance to be dazzled by the sets of Batman, Friends, Gilmore Girls, The Big Bang Theory, Harry Potter and other titles.\nIt also allows Tesla to take advantage of the large sound stages and sets, some of which resemble a slice of suburbia and even a small downtown area. This could be the perfect place for Tesla to do a demo of its Cybercab in autonomous action \u2013 it\u2019s a controlled, closed environment with no other traffic where the car will be able to drive itself at low speed.\nWe think the demo could feature the ride-hailing app that Tesla teased during its first-quarter earnings call in April.\nOther vehicle and product announcements\nScreenshot from Tesla\u2019s March 2023 investor presentation. Image Credits:Tesla\nThe title of the event, \u201cWe, Robot\u201d, is a nod to Isaac Asimov\u2019s series of science fiction short stories called \u201cI, Robot\u201d which explores the relationship between robots and humans. As such, many believe the event will feature updates on Optimus, Tesla\u2019s humanoid robot. That said, Asimov\u2019s stories revolve around three laws of robotics that prioritize human safety \u2013 1) A robot may not injure a human being or allow a human to be injured through inaction; 2) A robot must obey orders given by a human being unless that conflicts with the first law; 3) A robot must protect its own existence unless that contradicts the first and second laws. Those fit neatly into autonomous driving.\nDeepwater Asset Management predicts that in addition to a Cybercab prototype, Tesla will provide previews (but crucially not a prototype) for the $25,000 EV, which fans are calling the Model 2. Analysts Gene Munster and Brian Baker said they expect the Model 2 to have a similar look and feel to the Cybercab, likely based on past comments from Tesla that the two would share a vehicle platform.\nThe firm also thinks Tesla will provide more details on a Cybervan, a fully autonomous passenger van that could in the future augment public transportation. This prediction is based on Tesla\u2019s March 2023 investor presentation that featured a lineup of Tesla\u2019s current and future vehicles, including a teaser of a van-sized car.\nSome potential wildcards\nBuilding a robotaxi is one thing. Commercializing it is another. Tesla may be able to rely on the uniqueness of its vehicles and the company\u2019s general fan power to attract customers for a ride-hail service, but many won\u2019t want to make the switch to a service that will likely be less reliable at launch.\nOne wildcard prediction we have is that Tesla could announce a partnership with Uber, which has demonstrated that its existing global ride-hail platform is attractive to autonomous vehicle companies. Over the past few weeks, Uber has been signing on AV companies at a rapid clip, including Waymo, Cruise, Wayve, and others. While Musk seems to want to go it alone, partnering might be the best way to actually commercialize these vehicles.\nAnother potential wildcard is that McDonald\u2019s is involved in this somehow, based on an X post from the fast food chain last week that said, \u201cchat\u2019s about to pop off 10.10.\u201d Musk replied with the laugh-crying emoji, so we might expect to see some kind of autonomous food delivery demo or announcement with McDonald\u2019s on Thursday.\n\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 2, 2024\nWhat we don\u2019t expect to see\nThere will be plenty of hype and chatter about Musk\u2019s vision of an autonomous future, during which the executive will likely make the same argument that Uber made a decade ago about the possibilities for shared rides \u2013 it will be so easy and cheap to hail an AV, that people won\u2019t need to own their own vehicles.\nA rosy picture, but one that we don\u2019t expect to be backed up Thursday with a clear path to commercialization.\nIn the past, Musk has said Tesla vehicles on the roads today would be able to progress to autonomy with merely a software update, allowing owners to add their cars to Tesla\u2019s ride-sharing app and rent them out to make extra cash. Tesla has said it would take something like 25% to 30% of the revenue from those rides, and in places where there aren\u2019t enough people to share cars, the automaker would provide a dedicated fleet of robotaxis.\nMusk has been promising a fully autonomous Tesla for years now, but has yet to introduce one. Despite Tesla\u2019s advancements in its advanced driver assistance system, named Full Self-Driving (FSD), the tech is still not fully self-driving. It requires a human driver to be attentive behind the wheel and take over if needed.\nThis might be why Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, who is an undeniable Tesla bull, said he expects Tesla will offer a \u201c\u2018dual\u2019 approach with respect to autonomous ridesharing.\u201d There will be a \u2018supervised\u2019 autonomous/FSD rideshare service, and a fully autonomous app-based Cybercab, he said, with an expected initial commercial launch slated for late 2025 or 2026.\nWhen it comes to production of the Cybercabs themselves, the analysts at Deepwater point to the lag between Tesla\u2019s unveiling of products and ramping production. The minimum gap of 10 months was with the Model Y, whereas the Cybertruck took 48 months, and the Semi is at 79 months and counting. Tesla delivered a handful of Semis in December 2022, but has yet to ramp up to volume production.\n\u201cThis suggests the start of production for any of the vehicles announced in August would begin in June of 2025 at the earliest,\u201d Deepwater wrote.\nAnd since the robotaxi event got pushed back so Tesla could \u201cmake some important changes,\u201d then the product is still likely a long way off from being ready to go to production.\n\ntitle4:\nScientists who built \u2018foundation\u2019 for AI awarded Nobel Prize\ndescription4:\nTwo scientists credited with laying the \u201cfoundation of today\u2019s powerful machine learning,\u201d University of Toronto professor emeritus Geoffrey Hinton and Princeton University professor John Hopfield, were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics today.\nTheir discoveries and inventions laid the groundwork for many of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Since the 1980s, their work has enabled the creation of artificial neural networks, computer architecture loosely modeled after the structure of the brain.\nBy mimicking the way our brains make connections, neural networks allow AI tools to essentially \u201clearn by example.\u201d Developers can train an artificial neural network to recognize complex patterns by feeding it data, undergirding some of the most high-profile uses of AI today, from language generation to image recognition.\n\u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.\u201d\n\u201cI had no expectations of this. I am extremely surprised and I\u2019m honoured to be included,\u201d a \u201cflabbergasted\u201d Hinton said in a University of Toronto news release.\nHinton, often called \u201cThe Godfather of AI,\u201d told The New York Times last year that \u201ca part of him ... now regrets his life\u2019s work.\u201d He reportedly left his post at Google in 2023 in order to be able to call attention to the potential risks posed by the technology he was instrumental in bringing to fruition.\n\u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,\u201d Hinton said in the NYT interview.\nIn 2013, Google acquired Hinton\u2019s neural networks company, which he started with two students, including Ilya Sutskever who would later become chief scientist at OpenAI before leaving this year.\nThe Nobel committee recognized Hinton for developing what\u2019s called the Boltzmann machine, a generative model, with colleagues in the 1980s:\nHinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of systems built from many similar components. The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are very likely to arise when the machine is run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create new examples of the type of pattern on which it was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping initiate the current explosive development of machine learning.\nHinton\u2019s work builds on fellow awardee John Hopfield\u2019s Hopfield network, an artificial neural network that can recreate patterns:\nThe Hopfield network utilises physics that describes a material\u2019s characteristics due to its atomic spin \u2013 a property that makes each atom a tiny magnet. The network as a whole is described in a manner equivalent to the energy in the spin system found in physics, and is trained by finding values for the connections between the nodes so that the saved images have low energy. When the Hopfield network is fed a distorted or incomplete image, it methodically works through the nodes and updates their values so the network\u2019s energy falls. The network thus works stepwise to find the saved image that is most like the imperfect one it was fed with.\"\n\nResponse:",
