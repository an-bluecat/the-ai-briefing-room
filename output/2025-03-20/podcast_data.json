Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Plaintiffs claim that device owners haven\u2019t received the Apple Intelligence features they were promised.\n\u201cApple\u2019s advertisements [cultivated] a clear and reasonable consumer expectation that these transformative features would be available upon the iPhone\u2019s release,\u201d reads the complaint filed by attorneys for the plaintiffs. \u201cContrary to defendant\u2019s claims of advanced AI capabilities, the products offered a significantly limited or entirely absent version of Apple Intelligence, misleading consumers about its actual utility and performance.\u201d\nThe suit is the latest headache for Apple as it struggles to bring highly anticipated Apple Intelligence capabilities to market. Bloomberg reported Thursday that Apple CEO Tim Cook \u201chas lost confidence in the ability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product development.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nApple is reportedly losing $1B per year on its streaming service\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nApple is losing more than $1 billion per year on its streaming service, Apple TV+, according to a new report from The Information. Apple TV+ is the only service in Apple\u2019s portfolio that isn\u2019t profitable, the report reveals.\nThe company has spent around $5 billion on content each year since the streaming service launched in 2019, but brought that number down to $4.5 billion in 2024. Apple TV+ is known for original shows like \u201cSeverance,\u201d \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d \u201cSilo,\u201d and \u201cShrinking.\u201d\nDespite Apple TV+ productions earning more than 2,500 award nominations and wins, the streaming service has lagged behind Netflix, Disney+, and Amazon Prime Video when it comes to subscribers.\nAlthough Apple doesn\u2019t disclose how many subscribers its streaming service has, the report states that Apple TV+ has an estimated 45 million subscribers. For context, Netflix leads the streaming industry with 301 million subscribers.\n\ntitle3:\nNorth Korea launches new unit with a focus on AI hacking, per report\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nThe North Korean government is reportedly establishing a new hacking group within the intelligence agency Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB).\nDaily NK, a news outlet that focuses on North Korea, reported last week that the new hacking unit, called Research Center 227, will focus on research to develop \u201coffensive hacking technologies and programs,\u201d citing a source inside the regime.\nThe source said, per the report, Research Center 227 will research Western cybersecurity systems and computer networks, strengthening the regime\u2019s capabilities to steal digital assets; develop AI-based techniques for information theft; and work to respond to information from North Korean overseas hacking units.\nIn recent years, North Korean hackers have been known to target crypto exchanges and companies around the world, leading to spectacular thefts like the recent $1.4 billion-worth hack of Bybit.\nThe U.S. National Security Agency and the FBI have previously accused the North Korean RGB unit of hacking and espionage activities.\n\ntitle4:\nPerplexity is reportedly in talks to raise up to $1B at an $18B valuation\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAI-powered search startup Perplexity is said to be in early talks to raise up to $1 billion in a new funding round valuing the startup at $18 billion.\nBloomberg, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported on Thursday that Perplexity\u2019s annual recurring revenue has now reached $100 million.\nPerplexity\u2019s valuation has soared in recent years. This new round would double Perplexity\u2019s current valuation \u2014 $9 billion \u2014 as of December. In April 2024, Perplexity was valued at $1 billion.\nRumors of a new round come as competition in the AI-powered search space heats up.\nOn Thursday, Anthropic added web search to its consumer AI chatbot, Claude. Earlier in March, Google launched an early version of a chat-based AI search engine, called AI Mode, for a limited group of testers.\nPerhaps because its core market is becoming increasingly crowded, Perplexity is trying to expand into new areas. The startup recently teased the launch of an \u201cagentic\u201d browser called Comet, and it has ramped up its enterprise offerings, recently launching an AI search engine to help businesses retrieve information from internal documents.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Perplexity for comment on the fundraising rumors and will update this post if we hear back.\"\n\nResponse:",
