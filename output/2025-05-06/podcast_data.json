Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Similar to OpenAI\u2019s Operator, you can prompt Open Computer Agent to complete a task \u2014 say, \u201cUse Google Maps to find the Hugging Face HQ in Paris\u201d \u2014 and sit back as the agent opens the necessary programs and figures out the required steps.\nOpen Computer Agent can handle simple requests well enough. But more complicated ones, like searching for flights, tripped it up in TechCrunch\u2019s testing. Open Computer Agent also often runs into CAPTCHA tests that it\u2019s unable to solve.\nYou\u2019ll also have to wait in a virtual queue to use Open Computer Agent \u2014 a queue seconds to minutes long, depending on demand.\nWe're launching Computer Use in smolagents! \ud83e\udd73\n-> As vision models become more capable, they become able to power complex agentic workflows.

Rather, they wanted to demonstrate that open AI models are becoming more capable \u2014 and cheaper to run on cloud infrastructure.\n\u201cAs vision models become more capable, they become able to power complex agentic workflows,\u201d Aymeric Roucher, a member of the agents team at Hugging Face, wrote in a post on X. \u201c[Some of these models] support built-in grounding, i.e. [the] ability to locate any element in an image by its coordinates, [and] thus [can] click any item [in a virtual machine].\u201d\nWhile it\u2019s far from perfect, agentic technology is attracting increasing investment as enterprises look to adopt it to boost productivity. According to a recent KPMG survey, 65% of companies are experimenting with AI agents. Markets and Markets projects that the AI agent segment will grow from $7.84 billion in 2025 to $52.62 billion by 2030.\n\ntitle1:\nRivian earnings: EV maker cuts delivery guidance because of Trump's tariffs and trade wars\ndescription1:\nRivian said in its earnings report Tuesday it will likely deliver fewer vehicles this year than previously forecasted due to President Trump\u2019s tariffs and other regulatory changes, making it the latest automaker to be affected by the new administration\u2019s chaotic economic policies.\nThe company said Tuesday it expects to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 EVs by the end of 2025. That\u2019s despite Rivian saying one month ago that it was still holding to its estimate of delivering 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles across this year. Rivian raised its capital expenditure guidance to between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion due to the expected impact from tariffs. The company\u2019s previous capex guidance was between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, according to its 2024 shareholder letter.\nRivian\u2019s earnings announcement comes days after both Ford and General Motors pulled their guidance for the year, citing economic uncertainty related to Trump\u2019s tariffs. Ford said it expects the tariffs to add $2.5 billion in costs across 2025, while GM told investors it expects the impact to be around $5 billion.\nRivian warned investors in February that \u201cchanges to government policies and regulations, and a challenging demand environment\u201d could threaten demand for its vehicles. Things could only get more challenging if the Trump administration, Congress, or both decide to kill the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs.\nDelivering fewer than 46,000 EVs would be a step back for the electric automaker, as the company was already tracking for its third straight year with no volume growth before the guidance cut. Rivian delivered 51,579 vehicles in 2024 and 50,122 in 2023. The company\u2019s more affordable R2 SUV, which it expects to deliver in greater numbers, won\u2019t come until 2026.\nThe company said Tuesday that it was able to generate $206 million of gross profit in the first quarter of 2025 on 8,640 deliveries. It was the second straight quarter the company was able to generate gross profit. This first-quarter gross profit was particularly important because it met a contractual milestone that unlocked about $1 billion in funding from Volkswagen Group as part of a joint venture with the German automaker.\nWhile gross profit may look good on the balance sheet, net income provides a more realistic view of costs. The company reported a net income loss of $541 million in the quarter, a considerable improvement from the $1.4 billion in losses in the same year-ago period.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nAutomotive revenue shrank to $922 million from $1.12 billion in the first quarter of 2024, although total revenues were up slightly year-over-year thanks to a boost from sales of the company\u2019s software and services.\nTotal software and services revenues for the first quarter of 2025 were $318 million, nearly a fourfold increase from the $88 million in the same period last year. Rivian credited the increase to its new vehicle electrical architecture and software development services, increased remarketing sales, and an increase in repair and maintenance services.\nThis article was first published at 4:06 p.m. ET. It has since been updated with information from Rivian\u2019s earnings call.\n\ntitle2:\nNSO Group must pay more than $167 million in damages to WhatsApp for spyware campaign\ndescription2:\nSpyware maker NSO Group will have to pay more than $167 million in damages to WhatsApp for a 2019 hacking campaign against more than 1,400 users.\nOn Tuesday, after a five-year legal battle, a jury ruled that NSO Group must pay $167,254,000 in punitive damages and around $444,719 in compensatory damages.\nThis is a huge legal win for WhatsApp, which had asked for more than $400,000 in compensatory damages, based on the time its employees had to dedicate to remediate the attacks, investigate them, and push fixes to patch the vulnerability abused by NSO Group, as well as unspecified punitive damages.\nWhatsApp\u2019s spokesperson Zade Alsawah said in a statement that \u201cour court case has made history as the first victory against illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone.\u201d\nAlsawah said the ruling \u201cis an important step forward for privacy and security as the first victory against the development and use of illegal spyware that threatens the safety and privacy of everyone. Today, the jury\u2019s decision to force NSO, a notorious foreign spyware merchant, to pay damages is a critical deterrent to this malicious industry against their illegal acts aimed at American companies and the privacy and security of the people we serve.\u201d\nNSO Group\u2019s spokesperson Gil Lainer left the door open for an appeal.\n\u201cWe will carefully examine the verdict\u2019s details and pursue appropriate legal remedies, including further proceedings and an appeal,\u201d Lainer said in a statement.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nThe trial, as well as the whole lawsuit, prompted a series of revelations, such as the location of the victims of the 2019 spyware campaign, as well as the names of some of NSO Group\u2019s customers.\nThe ruling marks the end \u2014 pending a potential appeal \u2014 of a legal battle that started in more than five years ago, when WhatsApp filed a lawsuit against the spyware maker. The Meta-owned company accused NSO Group of accessing WhatsApp servers and exploiting an audio-calling vulnerability in the chat app to target around 1,400 people, including dissidents, human rights activists, and journalists.\nContact Us Do you have more information about NSO Group, or other spyware companies?

From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email .\nWill Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, explained the lawsuit\u2019s reasoning in a Washington Post op-ed at the time, where he said that \u201cthis should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all Internet users. Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk.\u201d\nLast December, WhatsApp won. Judge Phyllis Hamilton, who presided over the case, ruled that NSO Group was liable for breaching federal and California hacking laws in its 2019 spyware campaign against the 1,400 WhatsApp users. The judge ruled that NSO Group was also liable for breaching WhatsApp\u2019s terms of service, which prohibit the use of the app for malicious purposes.\nCathcart celebrated the December ruling saying in an X post that it was \u201ca huge win for privacy,\u201d and that \u201csurveillance companies should be on notice that illegal spying will not be tolerated.\u201d\nAt that point, the case moved on to a jury trial to determine what damages the spyware company owed WhatsApp, which has now concluded.\nJohn Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, where he has studied the spyware industry for more than a decade, celebrated the ruling.\n\u201cThis is an incredible moment for those of us who have been around since the beginning of research on mercenary spyware,\u201d Scott-Railton told TechCrunch. \u201cNSO makes many millions of dollars helping dictators hack people. After years of every trick and delay tactic it only took the jury a day\u2019s deliberation to see right through to the heart of the matter: NSO\u2019s business is based on hacking American companies\u2026so that dictators can hack dissidents.\u201d\n\u201cThe company emerges from this trial severely damaged. Aside from the huge punitive damages, the bigger impact of this case has also been a huge blow to NSO\u2019s efforts to hide their business activities,\u201d said Scott-Railton.\nThis story has been updated to include comments from WhatsApp and John Scott-Railton.\n\ntitle3:\nIBM CEO urges the Trump administration to increase - not cut - federal AI R&D funding\ndescription3:\nLike many leaders in tech, Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, thinks federal R&D funding for AI and related technologies should be increased \u2014 not the other way around.\n\u201cWe have been an extremely strong advocate \u2014 and this is both the company and me personally \u2014 on that federally funded R&D should be increased,\u201d Krishna said in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s the position, which is unequivocal, and we strongly believe in that.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump and his cabinet have sought to make deep cuts to federal grantmaking and scientific research programs in pursuit of a far different set of priorities than previous administrations.\nIn recent weeks, a key federal office for AI research, the Directorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), has been hit by steep budget reductions. Meanwhile, scores of staffers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation (NSF), which houses TIP, have found themselves on the chopping block.\nIn its proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, the Trump administration is calling on Congress to slash over half of the NSF\u2019s funding, eliminating what it describes as wasteful and \u201cwoke\u201d spending. At risk are the billions of dollars awarded to AI R&D projects by the NSF and other federal agencies, like the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy, which are also facing cuts.\nTrump has also threatened to end the CHIPS Act, a major Biden administration-era law that sought to boost domestic semiconductor production in the U.S., including the production of specialized chips for AI. The office responsible for administering CHIPS Act funds was largely gutted in early March.\nTech industry groups, including the Software and Information Industry Association, have sent letters to White House AI \u201cczar\u201d David Sacks and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warning that the reductions could hobble America\u2019s global leadership in AI. According to the U.S. Joint Economic Committee, federally funded research yields annual returns of 25% to 40%, comparing favorably to the 15% to 27% returns achieved by top-quartile VC funds.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\n\u201cWe believe that [federal R&D funding] right now [is] happening at close to historic lows in terms of percentage of GDP,\u201d Krishna told TechCrunch, \u201cand that more federally funded R&D has an incredibly positive effect on the economy, on economic growth, on the competitiveness of the United States, and also in investing in many technologies that are essential for our future.\u201d\nIBM has been directly affected by federal cutbacks. During its Q1 earnings call in April, the company revealed that 15 of its federal contracts were canceled, amounting to $100 million in future payments. Federal contracts represent between 5% and just under 10% of IBM\u2019s consulting practice.\nKrishna, who was quick to note that federal funding makes up only a fraction of IBM\u2019s overall business, said that he\u2019s \u201coptimistic\u201d the government will ramp up R&D spending within a year.\n\u201cI will tell you I expect that in a year \u2026 federally funded R&D for AI, for quantum, for semiconductors \u2014 I expect it to be in as good or in a better shape than it is today,\u201d Krishna said.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon-owned Zoox issues recall following robotaxi crash\ndescription4:\nZoox, the autonomous vehicle company owned by Amazon, paused its driverless testing program for more than a week and issued a voluntary recall of its software following a crash in Las Vegas, according to the company and a filing with federal safety regulators.\nThe April 8 crash, which involved an unoccupied Zoox vehicle and a passenger car, prompted the company to issue a recall for about 270 vehicles equipped with a specific version of its automated driving system. The recall number doesn\u2019t reflect the full fleet size, according to Zoox. The recall was issued over concerns the self-driving software could inaccurately predict the movement of another vehicle and increase the risk of a crash.\nThe company said no injuries were reported and minor damage occurred to both vehicles. The crash occurred after a passenger car quickly approached the lane from a commercial driveway where the purpose-built robotaxi was traveling, according to Zoox. The Zoox vehicle, which inaccurately predicted that the passenger car would proceed, slowed down and steered to the right. Instead, \u201cthe car came to a stop, fully yielding to the Zoox robotaxi and remaining in the shoulder lane,\u201d according to the company. \u201cThe Zoox robotaxi braked hard, but contact was unavoidable,\u201d the company wrote in its blog post.\nZoox said it paused all driverless testing operations on April 8 \u2014 the day of the crash \u2014 and launched an internal review. Operations resumed after a software update was released to all Zoox vehicles on April 17, according to a report submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe crash, and voluntary recall, comes as Zoox pushes to launch a commercial robotaxi service in Las Vegas. A company spokesperson confirmed that Zoox is still planning to launch that service later this year.\nThe company has been testing its self-driving system in retrofitted Toyota Highlanders and its custom-built robotaxis, which don\u2019t have a steering wheel or pedals in various cities, notably along the Las Vegas Strip and in certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Earlier this year, Zoox allowed employees, media, and other vetted guests to try the service. The company is also testing in Austin, Miami, and Seattle using Highlanders with human safety operators behind the wheel.\nThis is the second Zoox recall this year. In March, the company issued a voluntary recall for 258 vehicles due to issues with its autonomous driving system that could cause unexpected hard braking.\nLast year, the NHTSA conducted a preliminary investigation into the company after the agency received two reports of incidents in which motorcyclists collided with the back of Toyota Highlanders equipped with Zoox technology. The initial investigation found that in both cases, the Zoox vehicles were operating with their autonomous systems engaged.\"\n\nResponse:",
