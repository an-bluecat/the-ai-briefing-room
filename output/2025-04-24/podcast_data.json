Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Friday April 25), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nIntel reverses course, opts not to spin out Intel Capital\ndescription0:\nSemiconductor giant Intel won\u2019t spin out its venture arm, Intel Capital, after all.\nDuring Intel\u2019s Q1 earnings call Thursday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the company has reversed its decision to spin out its 34-year-old venture arm. Instead, Intel Capital will remain internal and continue to invest with Intel\u2019s interests in mind.\n\u201cWe have made the decision not to spin off Intel Capital, but to work with the team to monetize our existing portfolio, while being more selective on new investments that support the strategy we need to get our balance sheet healthy and start the process of deleveraging this year,\u201d Tan said on the call.\nIt\u2019s a stark change in Intel\u2019s plans for Intel Capital.\nIntel announced in January that Intel Capital was going to strike out on its own. Shortly after the announcement, Intel Capital VP and senior managing director Mark Rostick told TechCrunch that the firm had considered spinning out multiple times over the years.\n\u201cWe thought our track record merited attention from outside investors,\u201d Rostick told TechCrunch. \u201cWe had done really well, even while, you know, a lot of the venture industry hasn\u2019t been able to realize exits, we\u2019d had some success doing that, so we felt like we could position ourselves as a bit of an outlier there.\u201d\nTalks about spinning out got more serious last year \u2014 and reportedly had support from Intel\u2019s ex-CEO Pat Gelsinger. The original plan was for Intel Capital to become independent by the third quarter of this year; Intel would remain an investment partner.\nNow, it seems that won\u2019t come to pass.\n\ntitle1:\nIntel mandates four days in the office\ndescription1:\nIntel says that it\u2019ll require employees to work from the office four days a week, a shift from the company\u2019s current policy.\nCEO Lip-Bu Tan made the announcement during Intel\u2019s Q1 2025 earnings call on Thursday. Previously, Intel allowed staff to work from home two days a week, but Tan said that adherence to the company\u2019s hybrid work policy has been \u201cuneven at best.\u201d\n\u201cI strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action,\u201d Tan said. \u201cWhen we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.\u201d\nThe policy change will go into effect September 1. Tan said that local leadership will share \u201csite-specific details\u201d and \u201cseek [staff] input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.\u201d\nIntel, which is reportedly planning to lay off as much as 20% of its workforce, is the latest big tech company to mandate a return to the office.\nAmazon made headlines in 2024 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that corporate employees must return to work in the office five days a week. Salesforce implemented a four-day-per-week policy in October. And Apple moved to a hybrid setup in 2022.\nEvidence is mixed on whether working from the office bolsters productivity. Research has shown, however, that return-to-office mandates hurt employee satisfaction.\n\ntitle2:\nAnthropic CEO wants to open the black box of AI models by 2027\ndescription2:\nAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei published an essay Thursday highlighting how little researchers understand about the inner workings of the world\u2019s leading AI models. To address that, Amodei set an ambitious goal for Anthropic to reliably detect most AI model problems by 2027.\nAmodei acknowledges the challenge ahead. In \u201cThe Urgency of Interpretability,\u201d the CEO says Anthropic has made early breakthroughs in tracing how models arrive at their answers \u2014 but emphasizes that far more research is needed to decode these systems as they grow more powerful.\n\u201cI am very concerned about deploying such systems without a better handle on interpretability,\u201d Amodei wrote in the essay. \u201cThese systems will be absolutely central to the economy, technology, and national security, and will be capable of so much autonomy that I consider it basically unacceptable for humanity to be totally ignorant of how they work.\u201d\nAnthropic is one of the pioneering companies in mechanistic interpretability, a field that aims to open the black box of AI models and understand why they make the decisions they do. Despite the rapid performance improvements of the tech industry\u2019s AI models, we still have relatively little idea how these systems arrive at decisions.\nFor example, OpenAI recently launched new reasoning AI models, o3 and o4-mini, that perform better on some tasks, but also hallucinate more than its other models. The company doesn\u2019t know why it\u2019s happening.\n\u201cWhen a generative AI system does something, like summarize a financial document, we have no idea, at a specific or precise level, why it makes the choices it does \u2014 why it chooses certain words over others, or why it occasionally makes a mistake despite usually being accurate,\u201d Amodei wrote in the essay.\nIn the essay, Amodei notes that Anthropic co-founder Chris Olah says that AI models are \u201cgrown more than they are built.\u201d In other words, AI researchers have found ways to improve AI model intelligence, but they don\u2019t quite know why.\nIn the essay, Amodei says it could be dangerous to reach AGI \u2014 or as he calls it, \u201ca country of geniuses in a data center\u201d \u2014 without understanding how these models work. In a previous essay, Amodei claimed the tech industry could reach such a milestone by 2026 or 2027, but believes we\u2019re much further out from fully understanding these AI models.\nIn the long term, Amodei says Anthropic would like to, essentially, conduct \u201cbrain scans\u201d or \u201cMRIs\u201d of state-of-the-art AI models. These checkups would help identify a wide range of issues in AI models, including their tendencies to lie or seek power, or other weakness, he says. This could take five to 10 years to achieve, but these measures will be necessary to test and deploy Anthropic\u2019s future AI models, he added.\nAnthropic has made a few research breakthroughs that have allowed it to better understand how its AI models work. For example, the company recently found ways to trace an AI model\u2019s thinking pathways through, what the company call, circuits. Anthropic identified one circuit that helps AI models understand which U.S. cities are located in which U.S. states. The company has only found a few of these circuits but estimates there are millions within AI models.\nAnthropic has been investing in interpretability research itself and recently made its first investment in a startup working on interpretability. While interpretability is largely seen as a field of safety research today, Amodei notes that, eventually, explaining how AI models arrive at their answers could present a commercial advantage.\nIn the essay, Amodei called on OpenAI and Google DeepMind to increase their research efforts in the field. Beyond the friendly nudge, Anthropic\u2019s CEO asked for governments to impose \u201clight-touch\u201d regulations to encourage interpretability research, such as requirements for companies to disclose their safety and security practices. In the essay, Amodei also says the U.S. should put export controls on chips to China, in order to limit the likelihood of an out-of-control, global AI race.\nAnthropic has always stood out from OpenAI and Google for its focus on safety. While other tech companies pushed back on California\u2019s controversial AI safety bill, SB 1047, Anthropic issued modest support and recommendations for the bill, which would have set safety reporting standards for frontier AI model developers.\nIn this case, Anthropic seems to be pushing for an industry-wide effort to better understand AI models, not just increasing their capabilities.\n\ntitle3:\nOpenAI rolls out a 'lightweight' version of its ChatGPT deep research tool\ndescription3:\nOpenAI is bringing a new \u201clightweight\u201d version of its ChatGPT deep research tool, which scours the web to compile research reports on a topic, to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users, the company announced Thursday.\nThe new lightweight deep research, which will also come to free ChatGPT users starting today, is powered by a version of OpenAI\u2019s o4-mini model, OpenAI says. It\u2019s not quite as capable as the \u201cfull\u201d deep research, but OpenAI claims it\u2019s cheaper to serve and thus enables the company to up usage limits.\n\u201cResponses will typically be shorter while maintaining the depth and quality you\u2019ve come to expect,\u201d OpenAI said in a series of posts on X. \u201cOnce limits for the original version of deep research are reached, queries automatically default to the lightweight version.\u201d\nThere\u2019s been a raft of deep research tools launched recently across chatbots including Google\u2019s Gemini, Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and xAI\u2019s Grok. Driving them are reasoning AI models, which possess the ability to think through problems and fact-check themselves \u2014 skills arguably important for conducting in-depth research on a subject.\nChatGPT\u2019s lightweight deep research will come to Enterprise and educational users next week with the same usage levels as Team users, OpenAI says.\n\ntitle4:\nReport: Adam Neumann\u2019s Flow raises $100M+, more than doubles valuation to $2.5B\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nFormer WeWork CEO Adam Neumann has raised over $100 million in capital for his proptech startup, Flow, in a round that values that company at about $2.5 billion, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.\nCiting anonymous sources familiar with the deal, Bloomberg reported that existing backer Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) participated in the financing.\nNeumann told Bloomberg that he was \u201csure\u201d Flow was a company that could go public \u201cone day.\u201d\nFlow \u2014 a residential real estate company focused on rentals and co-living \u2014 raised $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz at a valuation of $1 billion in 2022. The funding raised eyebrows given the problematic history of Neumann\u2019s previous startup, WeWork. Once valued at $47 billion, WeWork filed for bankruptcy protection in 2023 and was ultimately acquired by Yardi, a real estate group, for $450 million.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Andreessen Horowitz and Flow for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
