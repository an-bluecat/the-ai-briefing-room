Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Babuschkin led engineering teams at xAI and helped build the startup into one of Silicon Valley\u2019s leading AI model developers just a few years after it was founded.\n\u201cToday was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023,\u201d Babuschkin wrote in the post. \u201cI still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.\u201d\nToday was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023. I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.\nBuilding\u2026 \u2014 Igor Babuschkin (@ibab) August 13, 2025\nBabuschkin is leaving xAI to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures, which he says will support AI safety research and back startups that \u201cadvance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.\u201d\nThe xAI co-founder says he was inspired to start the firm after a dinner with Max Tegmark, the founder of the Future of Life Institute, in which they discussed how AI systems could be built safely to encourage the flourishing of future generations. In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children.\nBabuschkin\u2019s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found to cite Musk\u2019s personal opinions when trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI\u2019s chatbot went on antisemitic rants and called itself \u201cMechahitler.\u201d Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videos resembling nude public figures, such as Taylor Swift.\nThese scandals have at times overshadowed the performance of xAI\u2019s models, which are state-of-the-art on several benchmarks compared to AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\nPrior to co-founding xAI, Babuschkin was part of a research team at Google DeepMind that pioneered AlphaStar in 2019, a breakthrough AI system that could defeat top-ranked players at the video game StarCraft. Babuschkin also worked as a researcher at OpenAI in the years before it released ChatGPT.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He notes that industry veterans called xAI\u2019s goal of building its Memphis, Tennessee supercomputer in just three months \u201cimpossible.\u201d\nxAI was able to build its AI supercomputer in record time, however, environmentalists warn that the temporary gas turbines powering the cluster are pumping out emissions into neighboring communities and exacerbating their longstanding health issues.\nNevertheless, Babuschkin says he\u2019s already looking back fondly on his time at xAI, and \u201cfeels like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college.\u201d\n\u201cI learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency,\u201d said Babuschkin.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

For just 15 bucks, I get to experience what feels like a miracle of modern technology, and yet, there\u2019s a nagging thought I can\u2019t shake.\nThe music sucks in here.\nWaymo\u2019s music-streaming feature has felt like an aged barnacle attached to a futuristic shell. Until this week, passengers were limited to a few music stations that played lo-fi beats, smooth jazz, K-pop, or other genres they may or may not care for. For those who wanted to listen to something more specific, they had to use another app from Waymo\u2019s parent company Alphabet.\nFor iPhone users, that meant downloading the Google Assistant app and configuring it to connect to Spotify. At that point, you had to ask Google Assistant through written or verbal commands to stream certain songs, artists, or playlists on the Waymo. Even if you get to this point \u2014 at which you may be halfway to your destination and have listened to approximately three lo-fi beats \u2014 the service didn\u2019t work reliably.\nAs I rode along in a robotaxi full of cutting-edge technology, I was puzzled why Waymo had not figured out a simple way to stream music from my phone into the car\u2019s speakers \u2014 a breakthrough that automakers and audio manufacturers figured out a couple of decades ago.\nThat\u2019s why I was pleasantly surprised this week to see that Waymo launched a Spotify integration allowing users to seamlessly link the music-streaming and robotaxi-hailing services. I immediately connected the services and hailed a Waymo to see how it would work.\nListening to Spotify in a Waymo. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\nWaymo\u2019s Spotify integration is nothing groundbreaking, but it adds to the user experience. It works seamlessly, which is roughly what I would expect when trying to play music on my car\u2019s speakers in 2025. But riding around in a Waymo, listening to my own playlist or picking up where I left off on a podcast, the back seat of the robotaxi feels more like my own space \u2014 which is increasingly the reason I opt for a Waymo.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nTo set it up, open the Waymo app and navigate to the \u201cMusic\u201d section, where you will notice a new offering that lets you connect to Spotify. From there, you can press a button and authorize Spotify to connect to Waymo, albeit while giving the robotaxi provider some access to your listening information.\nImage Credits:Maxwell Zeff (screenshot) Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff (screenshot)\nI\u2019m sure Apple Music users will soon want to stream their music and podcasts in Waymos as well. Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli told TechCrunch the company is always exploring new personalization options but did not clarify when the company might add an Apple Music integration.\nOnce my Waymo and Spotify accounts were linked, I hailed a Waymo like I usually would and got in. On the Waymo\u2019s touchscreen in the back seat, there\u2019s an option to select Spotify. I tapped it, and the podcast I was listening to on my headphones started playing from the exact spot I left off.\nListening to TechCrunch\u2019s flagship podcast in a waymo. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\nYou can turn \u201cautoplay\u201d on or off in Waymo\u2019s Music settings, and upon entry, the robotaxi will automatically start playing whatever song or podcast you were listening to on Spotify. I liked having it on, but it does feel like it could get you into an odd situation if you\u2019re listening to an intense true crime podcast and then get into a Waymo with work colleagues.\nYou can also use the Waymo\u2019s touchscreen to select from a variety of customized playlists that Spotify users will be familiar with, such as your \u201cDaylist\u201d or other mixes. However, this selection doesn\u2019t seem to include albums, audiobooks, or podcasts that you\u2019ve recently listened to.\nChoosing from different Spotify mixes. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\nLuckily, your Spotify app now controls the music in the Waymo. You can simply select any song or playlist you want from your smartphone and stream it throughout the vehicle like you would using Apple CarPlay or a bluetooth speaker.\nControlling the Waymo\u2019s tunes with your phone. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\nIn the end, the Spotify integration made my robotaxi feel more personalized; I was even able to tweak the bass, subwoofer, and treble levels in the car\u2019s speakers. That personalization may not be the main attraction for first-time users, but it could keep them coming back \u2014 and a loyal customer base is exactly what Waymo needs.\n\ntitle2:\nIndia's Rapido begins testing food delivery to take on Swiggy, Zomato\ndescription2:\nRapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India, has quietly begun beta testing its food delivery service in Bengaluru, marking its first serious move to challenge market leaders Swiggy and Zomato in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing delivery markets.\nThe 10-year-old startup has started testing its food delivery service in three primary localities in the southern city of Bengaluru, namely Byrasandra, Tavarekere, and Madiwala (BTM) Layout, Hosur Sarjapura Road (HSR) Layout, and Koramangala, Rapido co-founder and CEO Aravind Sanka confirmed to TechCrunch.\nRapido created a wholly owned subsidiary Ctrlx Technologies to launch its food delivery service, named Ownly. The subsidiary lists Sanka and Rapido vice president of finance Vivek Krishna as the directors, per the regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch.\nSanka said there was no specific reason for setting up the subsidiary. However, it may be a strategic move to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Swiggy, which currently holds a 12% minority stake in the ride-hailing startup.\nSwiggy recently confirmed in a letter to shareholders that it would reevaluate its investment in Rapido, citing a potential conflict of interest \u201cthat may arise in the future.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Rapido\u2019s Ownly has also released its Android app on Google Play that offers food from nearby restaurants at around 15% lower prices than those on Swiggy and Zomato.\nRapido\u2019s Ownly Food delivery app. Image Credits:Ownly\nThe lower pricing is a result of Rapido\u2019s model of not taking commissions from restaurants, which are up to 30% in the case of other food delivery apps, including Swiggy and Zomato, and instead charging a fixed fee per order. The startup mentioned its fixed-fee approach in a proposal to restaurants in June.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nRapido has a fleet of around 10 million vehicles, including 5 to 6 million two-wheelers, across India, a person familiar with the startup\u2019s business told TechCrunch recently. The company is using its two-wheeler fleet to deliver food \u2014 alongside offering its taxi and courier services.\nRapido will avoid showing restaurants located far from customers to reduce fuel costs and delivery times, and will curate menu items on its app to maximize margins while offering enough discoverability, a Rapido investor told TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.\nWhile handling deliveries for Swiggy, Rapido gained insight into peak hours and high-demand restaurants \u2014 the data it would now leverage for its own food delivery service, the investor said.\nThe agreement with Swiggy does not prevent Rapido from using this data, although it does prohibit the startup from entering into contracts with Zomato or other competitors, the investor added.\nFounded in 2015, Rapido began as a bike taxi aggregator before expanding into auto rickshaws, parcel delivery, and third-party logistics. In 2023, it entered the cab business to take on Uber and local rival Ola. The startup gained traction in this segment with its subscription-based model, positioning it as an alternative to the commission-based approach used by its competitors.\nRapido also partnered with Taiwanese battery-swapping electric two-wheeler maker Gogoro to deploy its vehicles as bike taxis. Moreover, the recent moves helped the startup boost its valuation and become a unicorn last year.\nIndia\u2019s online food delivery market is projected to surpass \u20b92 trillion (approximately $23 billion) by 2030, per a report by Bain & Company and Swiggy released last year. Zomato currently leads the market with a 58% share, according to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, while Swiggy holds the remaining 42%, per Bernstein. Uber was also among the early players in the space with Uber Eats, which it sold to Zomato in early 2020.\nSo far, Rapido has raised $574 million in 13 rounds, per Tracxn. It operates in more than 250 cities and handles over 3.5 million rides daily. The startup counts Prosus, WestBridge Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, and Think Investments, among its key investors.\n\ntitle3:\nInstagram is developing a feature that helps users find shared interests\ndescription3:\nInstagram is working on a feature called \u201cPicks\u201d that aims to help users find common interests. The Meta-owned social network confirmed to TechCrunch that Picks is an internal prototype and isn\u2019t being tested externally.\nThe feature was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they\u2019re still under development.\nAccording to screenshots shared by Paluzzi, people select their favorite movies, books, TV shows, games, and music, or their \u201cPicks.\u201d Instagram then finds overlaps with friends who chose the same things.\n#Instagram is working on Picks \ud83d\udc40\n\u2139\ufe0f Add what you're into and find overlap with friends who are all about it too pic.twitter.com/NXSqoGtqvf \u2014 Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) August 6, 2025\nWhile Instagram hasn\u2019t shared any details about the feature, the company likely views Picks as a way for users to connect more personally with friends and spark conversations around shared interests.\nInstagram head Adam Mosseri said earlier this year that the social network was going to focus on creativity and connection in 2025. \u201cTo help people connect with friends over the things they discover on Instagram, we\u2019re going to double down on messaging, make consuming content more interactive and social, and explore new ways to connect with friends,\u201d Mosseri wrote in a January Instagram post.\nOf course, not everyone will welcome Picks, as it adds yet another feature to an already overcrowded app. Instagram is facing backlash following the launch of Instagram Map, with many users saying they never wanted the feature in the first place.\nAs with any other feature in development, it\u2019s not known when or if Instagram plans to officially roll out Picks.\n\ntitle4:\nApple dismisses Elon Musk\u2019s claims that App Store favors OpenAI over other AI apps\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nApple has rejected Elon Musk\u2019s accusations that its App Store is biased against AI apps that compete with OpenAI.\n\u201cWe feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria,\u201d the BBC quoted Apple as saying.\nThe response comes after Musk threatened to sue Apple via xAI, claiming the iPhone maker was \u201cbehaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.\u201d\nApple and OpenAI entered a partnership last year to integrate the AI company\u2019s models and ChatGPT into Apple products, like Siri and iOS. But there is no evidence that the App Store favors OpenAI over other AI companies \u2014 indeed, AI apps like Perplexity and DeepSeek have topped the App Store charts over the last year.\nIn previous years, Apple would have likely ignored claims of chart manipulation. Today, however, the company faces regulatory pressure and new laws around the world to rein in its power in the app distribution market. Apple has also recently been taken to task by a U.S. district judge in its case with Epic Games over not implementing policy changes as the court instructed.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!
