Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

He also said the app has grown 4x since last year.\n\u201cEvery day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems. Big week ahead. Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and delivering on our mission so everyone can benefit from AI,\u201d he posted.\nThe app\u2019s popularity increased after OpenAI launched an upgraded image-generation feature, powered by the GPT-4 model, in March. In early April, the company\u2019s COO, Brad Lightcap, said that more than 130 million users had created over 700 million images in just a few days after the launch.\nThe company has also seen an increase in subscribers. Last week, Lightcap said that ChatGPT had 5 million paying business users, up from 3 million in June.\nIn a recent report, market intelligence firm Sensor Tower noted that users are using ChatGPT for more than 12 days a month on average, only behind Google and X. The report also said that in H1 2025, users spent an average of 16 minutes per day on the app.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle says its AI-based bug hunter found 20 security vulnerabilities\ndescription1:\nGoogle\u2019s AI-powered bug hunter has just reported its first batch of security vulnerabilities.\nHeather Adkins, Google\u2019s vice president of security, announced Monday that its LLM-based vulnerability researcher Big Sleep found and reported 20 flaws in various popular open source software.\nAdkins said that Big Sleep, which is developed by the company\u2019s AI department DeepMind as well as its elite team of hackers Project Zero, reported its first-ever vulnerabilities, mostly in open source software such as audio and video library FFmpeg and image-editing suite ImageMagick.\nGiven that the vulnerabilities are not fixed yet, we don\u2019t have details of their impact or severity, as Google does not yet want to provide details, which is a standard policy when waiting for bugs to be fixed. But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case.\n\u201cTo ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,\u201d Google\u2019s spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch.\nRoyal Hansen, Google\u2019s vice president of engineering, wrote on X that the findings demonstrate \u201ca new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.\u201d\nLLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilities are already a reality.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nXBOW has garnered headlines after it reached the top of one of the U.S. leaderboards at bug bounty platform HackerOne. It\u2019s important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.\nVlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a \u201clegit\u201d project, given that it has \u201cgood design, people behind it know what they\u2019re doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.\u201d\nThere is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides. Several people who maintain different software projects have complained of bug reports that are actually hallucinations, with some calling them the bug bounty equivalent of AI slop.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem people are running into, is we\u2019re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it\u2019s actually just crap,\u201d Ionescu previously told TechCrunch.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon denies report it's shutting down Wondery podcast studio\ndescription3:\nAmazon is denying that it\u2019s shutting down Wondery, the podcast studio it acquired in late 2020, after Bloomberg reported on Monday that the company was closing the studio and cutting 110 jobs.\nAmazon told TechCrunch that Wondery will continue to develop creator-led podcasts under the Wondery brand within a new team. What\u2019s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery\u2019s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows.\nWondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible.\n\u201cThe podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,\u201d Amazon said in an emailed statement.\n\u201cThese changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery\u2019s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.\u201d\nDespite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.\nUpdate: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down.\n\ntitle4:\nPerplexity accused of scraping websites that explicitly blocked AI scraping\ndescription4:\nAI startup Perplexity is crawling and scraping content from websites that have explicitly indicated they don\u2019t want to be scraped, according to internet infrastructure provider Cloudflare.\nOn Monday, Cloudflare published research saying it observed the AI startup ignore blocks and hide its crawling and scraping activities. The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages \u201cin an attempt to circumvent the website\u2019s preferences,\u201d Cloudflare\u2019s researchers wrote.\nAI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn\u2019t, efforts that have seen mixed results so far.\nPerplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots\u2019 \u201cuser agent,\u201d meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type, as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare.\n\u201cThis activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,\u201d read Cloudflare\u2019s post.\nPerplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare\u2019s blog post as a \u201csales pitch,\u201d adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post \u201cshow that no content was accessed.\u201d In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog \u201cisn\u2019t even ours.\u201d\nCloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity\u2019s known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe observed that Perplexity uses not only their declared user-agent, but also a generic browser intended to impersonate Google Chrome on macOS when their declared crawler was blocked,\u201d according to Cloudflare.\nThe company also said that it has de-listed Perplexity\u2019s bots from its verified list and added new techniques to block them.\nCloudflare has recently taken a public stance against AI crawlers. Last month, Cloudflare announced the launch of a marketplace allowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare\u2019s chief executive Matthew Prince sounded the alarm at the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare also launched a free tool to prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI.\nThis is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization.\nLast year, news outlets, such as Wired, alleged Perplexity was plagiarizing their content. Weeks later, Perplexity\u2019s CEO Aravind Srinivas was unable to immediately answer when asked to provide the company\u2019s definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch\u2019s Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference.\"\n\nResponse:",
