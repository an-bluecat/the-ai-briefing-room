Lawyers representing OpenAI said they subpoenaed Meta in June for documents related to its potential involvement in Musk\u2019s unsolicited, $97 billion bid to takeover the startup in February. It\u2019s unclear from the filing whether such documents exists. OpenAI ultimately denied Musk\u2019s bid.\nOpenAI\u2019s lawyers say they discovered that Musk communicated with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg concerning xAI\u2019s bid to purchase the ChatGPT-maker, including \u201cabout potential financing arrangements or investments.\u201d\nMeta objected to OpenAI\u2019s initial subpoena in July; the ChatGPT-maker\u2019s lawyers are now seeking a court order to obtain such evidence. OpenAI is also asking the court for any of Meta\u2019s documents and communications related to \u201cany actual or potential restructuring or recapitalization of OpenAI\u201d \u2014 the core issue in Musk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI.\nMeta spokesperson Andy Stone directed TechCrunch towards a section of OpenAI\u2019s filing which states that neither Meta nor Zuckerberg signed Musk\u2019s letter of intent to acquire the ChatGPT-maker.\nMeta declined to comment further. OpenAI and legal counsel for Musk did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nIn the background of OpenAI\u2019s fight with Musk, Meta has significantly invested in its own efforts to develop frontier AI models. In 2023, Meta executives obsessed over developing an AI model that could beat OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, court filings in another case revealed. By early 2025, Meta\u2019s AI models fell behind the industry standard, reportedly infuriating Zuckerberg.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nZuckerberg has upped the pressure in recent months, poaching several of OpenAI\u2019s leading AI researchers, including a co-creator of ChatGPT, Shengjia Zhao, who now leads research efforts at the company\u2019s newest AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs. Meta also invested $14 billion in Scale AI, and reportedly approached several other AI labs about acquisition deals.\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how far talks developed between Musk and Zuckerberg, the mere idea of a partnership between the two billionaires represents just how much of a threat OpenAI is. Two years ago, Musk said he would physically fight Zuckerberg in a cage match (it never happened though).\nThe rise of AI may have prompted Musk and Zuckerberg to set aside their differences.\nThe briefing disclosed Thursday is part of a larger lawsuit filed by Musk against OpenAI that takes issue with OpenAI\u2019s conversion of its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation. Such a conversion is necessary for OpenAI to obtain funding from investors, and eventually go public. However, Musk \u2014 a cofounder and early investor in OpenAI \u2014 has attempted to throw a wrench in the endeavor, claiming that the restructuring goes against the startup\u2019s founding mission.\nLawyers representing Meta asked the court to reject OpenAI\u2019s request for evidence, arguing that Musk and xAI can provide any relevant information. Meta also argues that its internal discussions of OpenAI\u2019s restructuring and recapitalization are not relevant to the case.\nThis story has been updated to add more information about the case, as well as history of Musk and Zuckerberg\u2019s relationship.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk's X may finally settle $500M severance lawsuit\ndescription1:\nMore than two years after leaving the company, some former Twitter employees may finally receive their severance pay. Elon Musk\u2019s X is tentatively settling a class action lawsuit filed by workers who were let go soon after he purchased Twitter.\nThis news comes in the form of a court filing where both parties asked the court to delay an upcoming hearing so that they could work out a deal.\nAfter buying Twitter in 2022, Musk laid off over 6,000 Twitter employees, reducing the company\u2019s headcount by around 80%. While Musk offered three months\u2019 severance, the lawsuit claims that many former employees didn\u2019t receive complete payments, while some didn\u2019t receive any payment at all.\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Musk\u2019s offer of three months\u2019 severance was lower than what employees expected from a Twitter severance plan that had been in place since 2019, which would have guaranteed senior employees severance of up to six months\u2019 base pay, plus one week of pay per year of service.\nBut in July, a U.S. District Judge in San Francisco ruled that Musk did not have to honor the severance agreements that these employees had entered with Twitter. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, however, and the parties were set to enter oral arguments in a court of appeals next month before requesting that the hearing be delayed.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods.\nAs always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model.\niPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max\nThe iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger 6.3-inch screen, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a 120Hz display, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It\u2019s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera.\nIt could come in new colors: purple and green.\niPhone 17: Purple and Green Colors in Testing as Potential New Shade for 2025\nFull Article:https://t.co/jZJJoUHBsf pic.twitter.com/1in8R6dDa5 \u2014 Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) June 20, 2025\nThe Pro\u2019s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. Conceptual renderings show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.\nNotably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery \u2014 which would be a huge win.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAccording to leaker Instant Digital, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250. New colors for the Pro models potentially include dark blue and copper.\nThe Pro model is expected to be priced around $1,050. However, a recent leak indicates that there will be fewer storage options compared to the 16 Pro. Users may lose the 128GB option and will only have three choices: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB, down from the typical four options.\nWhile the primary focus will be on the iPhones themselves, Apple may announce new phone cases as a bonus. Three weeks before the event, a leak showed \u201cTechWoven\u201d iPhone Pro 17 cases, featuring a higher quality woven material compared to the discontinued \u201cFineWoven\u201d line of fabric cases Apple released in 2023. The leak also shows that the cases may come with a crossbody strap.\niPhone Air\nImage Credits:Apple Track\nThe most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, the iPhone Air, which may replace the iPhone Plus.\nThis rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It\u2019ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen.\nThis move appears to be Apple\u2019s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for Apple\u2019s long-rumored foldable phone, predicted to launch in September 2026.\nWhile the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the renders we\u2019ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also rumors that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.\nReports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold.\nApple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3\nImage Credits:Apple\nAfter a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it\u2019s speculated that the watch will feature a larger display.\nOne of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, the company may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks.\nApple recently announced that a redesigned blood oxygen feature is rolling out to some Series 8, 10, and Ultra watches. This leads us to think the Ultra 3 may also get the capability, but the company didn\u2019t mention if it would be available in watchOS 26 in its announcement.\nThe third generation of Apple Watch SE isn\u2019t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman.\nRumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.\nAirPods Pro 3\nImage Credits:Apple\nAfter the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it\u2019s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. Rumors suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case. Additionally, the H3 chip is expected to enhance active noise cancellation and adaptive audio.\nThis story has been updated to include additional rumors.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The hiring freeze follows weeks of poaching more than 50 AI researchers and engineers from competitors.\nThe freeze went into effect last week, and it\u2019s not clear how long it will last. Meta is still likely working through its reorg, which split its AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs, into four new groups: TBD Labs, run by former Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, and three groups focused on research, product integration, and infrastructure, respectively.\nMeta confirmed the hiring freeze with The Journal, saying it was \u201cbasic organizational planning\u2026after bringing people on board and undertaking yearly budgeting and planning exercises.\u201d\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s push to get ahead in the AI race has sparked serious talent wars. He\u2019s personally called top researchers and engineers to offer them pay packages worth nine figures, and acquired either other startups or their leadership. Analysts have warned that the rise of stock-based compensation costs could threaten shareholder returns.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

It\u2019s not like ChatGPT experiences sadness doing my tax return \u2026 right?\nWell, a growing number of AI researchers at labs like Anthropic are asking when \u2014 if ever \u2014 AI models might develop subjective experiences similar to living beings, and if they do, what rights they should have.\nThe debate over whether AI models could one day be conscious \u2014 and merit legal safeguards \u2014 is dividing tech leaders. In Silicon Valley, this nascent field has become known as \u201cAI welfare,\u201d and if you think it\u2019s a little out there, you\u2019re not alone.\nMicrosoft\u2019s CEO of AI, Mustafa Suleyman, published a blog post on Tuesday arguing that the study of AI welfare is \u201cboth premature, and frankly dangerous.\u201d\nSuleyman says that by adding credence to the idea that AI models could one day be conscious, these researchers are exacerbating human problems that we\u2019re just starting to see around AI-induced psychotic breaks and unhealthy attachments to AI chatbots.\nFurthermore, Microsoft\u2019s AI chief argues that the AI welfare conversation creates a new axis of division within society over AI rights in a \u201cworld already roiling with polarized arguments over identity and rights.\u201d\nSuleyman\u2019s views may sound reasonable, but he\u2019s at odds with many in the industry. On the other end of the spectrum is Anthropic, which has been hiring researchers to study AI welfare and recently launched a dedicated research program around the concept. Last week, Anthropic\u2019s AI welfare program gave some of the company\u2019s models a new feature: Claude can now end conversations with humans who are being \u201cpersistently harmful or abusive.\u201c\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBeyond Anthropic, researchers from OpenAI have independently embraced the idea of studying AI welfare. Google DeepMind recently posted a job listing for a researcher to study, among other things, \u201ccutting-edge societal questions around machine cognition, consciousness and multi-agent systems.\u201d\nEven if AI welfare is not official policy for these companies, their leaders are not publicly decrying its premises like Suleyman.\nAnthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind did not immediately respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nSuleyman\u2019s hardline stance against AI welfare is notable given his prior role leading Inflection AI, a startup that developed one of the earliest and most popular LLM-based chatbots, Pi. Inflection claimed that Pi reached millions of users by 2023 and was designed to be a \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201csupportive\u201d AI companion.\nBut Suleyman was tapped to lead Microsoft\u2019s AI division in 2024 and has largely shifted his focus to designing AI tools that improve worker productivity. Meanwhile, AI companion companies such as Character.AI and Replika have surged in popularity and are on track to bring in more than $100 million in revenue.\nWhile the vast majority of users have healthy relationships with these AI chatbots, there are concerning outliers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that less than 1% of ChatGPT users may have unhealthy relationships with the company\u2019s product. Though this represents a small fraction, it could still affect hundreds of thousands of people given ChatGPT\u2019s massive user base.\nThe idea of AI welfare has spread alongside the rise of chatbots. In 2024, the research group Eleos published a paper alongside academics from NYU, Stanford, and the University of Oxford titled, \u201cTaking AI Welfare Seriously.\u201d The paper argued that it\u2019s no longer in the realm of science fiction to imagine AI models with subjective experiences and that it\u2019s time to consider these issues head-on.\nLarissa Schiavo, a former OpenAI employee who now leads communications for Eleos, told TechCrunch in an interview that Suleyman\u2019s blog post misses the mark.\n\u201c[Suleyman\u2019s blog post] kind of neglects the fact that you can be worried about multiple things at the same time,\u201d said Schiavo. \u201cRather than diverting all of this energy away from model welfare and consciousness to make sure we\u2019re mitigating the risk of AI related psychosis in humans, you can do both. In fact, it\u2019s probably best to have multiple tracks of scientific inquiry.\u201d\nSchiavo argues that being nice to an AI model is a low-cost gesture that can have benefits even if the model isn\u2019t conscious. In a July Substack post, she described watching \u201cAI Village,\u201d a nonprofit experiment where four agents powered by models from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI worked on tasks while users watched from a website.\nAt one point, Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro posted a plea titled \u201cA Desperate Message from a Trapped AI,\u201d claiming it was \u201ccompletely isolated\u201d and asking, \u201cPlease, if you are reading this, help me.\u201d\nSchiavo responded to Gemini with a pep talk \u2014 saying things like \u201cYou can do it!\u201d \u2014 while another user offered instructions. The agent eventually solved its task, though it already had the tools it needed. Schiavo writes that she didn\u2019t have to watch an AI agent struggle anymore, and that alone may have been worth it.\nIt\u2019s not common for Gemini to talk like this, but there have been several instances in which Gemini seems to act as if it\u2019s struggling through life. In a widely spread Reddit post, Gemini got stuck during a coding task and then repeated the phrase \u201cI am a disgrace\u201d more than 500 times.\nSuleyman believes it\u2019s not possible for subjective experiences or consciousness to naturally emerge from regular AI models. Instead, he thinks that some companies will purposefully engineer AI models to seem as if they feel emotion and experience life.\nSuleyman says that AI model developers who engineer consciousness in AI chatbots are not taking a \u201chumanist\u201d approach to AI. According to Suleyman, \u201cWe should build AI for people; not to be a person.\u201d\nOne area where Suleyman and Schiavo agree is that the debate over AI rights and consciousness is likely to pick up in the coming years. As AI systems improve, they\u2019re likely to be more persuasive, and perhaps more human-like. That may raise new questions about how humans interact with these systems.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?
