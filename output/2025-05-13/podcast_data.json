Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Chime had reportedly filed confidential S-1 paperwork back in December.\nS-1 filings typically reveal all kinds of information, covering financial, legal, and other risk factors. But Chime\u2019s S-1 documents still have a lot of blank spaces. We don\u2019t know how many shares it hopes to sell or at what price. Chime could be aiming to raise $1 billion, IPO specialist Renaissance Capital believes.\nWe also don\u2019t know how many shares insiders plan to sell as part of the IPO. This includes its major backers, a list that includes billionaire Yuri Milner\u2019s DST Global, Michael Stark\u2019s Crosslink Capital, billionaire Len Blavatnik\u2019s Access Industries, as well as VC firms General Atlantic, Menlo Ventures (led by board member Shawn Carolan), the Sino French Innovation Fund, and Iconiq, according to the paperwork.\nChime raised $2.65 billion total as a private company, including its last raise in 2021 that valued it at $25 billion, PitchBook estimates. As a result, there are many more VCs on its cap table. They, too, could be in for big paydays. For instance, Kirsten Green\u2019s Forerunner Ventures and Hunter Walk\u2019s Homebrew both claim Chime as a portfolio company.\nChime offered one detail that suggests the company believes it will be a huge IPO. Chime enlisted an army of big name investment bankers, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan.\nThe financials show why investors may grow excited. The company finished 2024 with $1.67 billion in revenue and $25 million in losses, compared to nearly $1.3 billion in revenue and $203 million in losses in 2023. Its 2025 first-quarter revenue was already $519 million. So, by Silicon Valley math, that puts it on track for $2 billion this year and near profitability.\nChime offers consumer checking, savings, debit, and credit cards and claims 8.6 million active users.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Its board member Cynthia Marshall served as the CEO of the Dallas Mavericks from 2018 to December 2024. Chime became a Mavericks sponsor during that time. It paid around $33 million over three years (2022-2024), which gained it the Chime logo on the team\u2019s jersey, among other marketing benefits. Without that deal, it might have already been profitable.\n\ntitle1:\nAnthropic, Google score win by nabbing OpenAI-backed Harvey as a user\ndescription1:\nPopular legal AI tool Harvey will now be using leading foundation models from Anthropic and Google, moving beyond strictly using OpenAI\u2019s, Harvey announced in a blog post on Tuesday.\nThis is noteworthy because Harvey is one of the OpenAI Startup Fund\u2019s most successful early-backed portfolio companies. The OpenAI Startup Fund is an OpenAI-associated fund to back companies developing products on top of AI technologies, primarily OpenAI\u2019s own. While Harvey says it\u2019s not abandoning OpenAI, merely adding more models and clouds, this is still a huge coup for OpenAI\u2019s big competitors.\nHarvey is one of the first four startups that the OpenAI Startup Fund backed, it said in December 2022. That was back when OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was still running the fund. (The others in that first cohort include Descript, Mem, and Speak.)\nHarvey, which has grown like mad since then, is now a $3-billion-valuation startup, it said in February, when it announced a $300 million Series D led by Sequoia, with other big names like Coatue, Kleiner Perkins, and the OpenAI Fund piling in.\nInterestingly, Google\u2019s venture arm, GV, led Harvey\u2019s $100 million Series C in July 2024 (and the OpenAI Fund participated in that round, too). But Harvey didn\u2019t immediately adopt Google\u2019s AI models after it put Google\u2019s corporate venture firm on its cap table. (GV participated in Harvey\u2019s Series D as well.)\nSo, what convinced Harvey to move beyond OpenAI\u2019s models now? The startup\u2019s internally developed benchmark, dubbed BigLaw, showed that a wide variety of foundation models are growing increasingly adept at a range of legal tasks and some are better at specific tasks than others.\nInstead of spending its efforts training models, Harvey figured, it could simply embrace high-performing, reasoning foundation models from other vendors (e.g. Google and Anthropic via Amazon\u2019s cloud) and then fine-tune them for the legal market.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nUsing a variety of models will also help as Harvey creates AI agents, the company says.\n\u201cIn less than a year, seven models (including three non-OAI models) now outperform the originally benchmarked Harvey system on BigLaw Bench,\u201d Harvey wrote in the blog post.\nHarvey\u2019s benchmark also showed that different foundation models are better at specific legal tasks than others. For instance, it says Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro \u201cexcels\u201d at legal drafting but \u201cstruggles\u201d with pre-trial tasks like writing oral arguments because the model doesn\u2019t fully understand \u201ccomplex evidentiary rules like hearsay.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 does such pre-trial tasks well, according to Harvey\u2019s testing, with Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet following close behind.\nResults from Harvey\u2019s internal benchmarking Image Credits:Harvey\nIn its blog post, Harvey says that it will also now join the growing ranks of those sharing a public leaderboard of model benchmark performance. Its board will rank how major reasoning models are doing on legal tasks. And the company won\u2019t just boil rankings down to a single number, but will also publish research where \u201ctop lawyers provide nuanced insights into model performance not captured by single-score benchmarks.\u201d\nSo, not only is OpenAI-backed Harvey adopting competitors\u2019 models, it is also amping up the pressure on its backers (including Google) to keep proving themselves. Not that OpenAI should worry much on that score. While AI benchmarking is growing increasingly complex and somewhat political, this is a world where OpenAI still shines.\n\u201cWe are incredibly fortunate to have OpenAI as an investor in Harvey and key collaborator in our product,\u201d Harvey CEO Winston Weinberg told TechCrunch in a statement. \u201cAnd, we are energized to add to our options for customers as we continue to serve the needs of our customers globally.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nY Combinator says Google is a \u2018monopolist\u2019 that has \u2018stunted\u2019 the startup ecosystem\ndescription2:\nFabled startup investor and accelerator Y Combinator has some choice words for Google in an amicus brief it just submitted in the U.S.\u2019s monopoly case against the search giant.\nIn the brief, YC charged that Google is a \u201cmonopolist\u201d that has \u201cstunted\u201d the U.S. startup ecosystem by making VC firms like itself hesitate to fund web search and AI startups in what it calls a \u201ckill zone\u201d around Google.\n\u201cGoogle has chilled independent firms like YC from funding and accelerating innovative startups that could otherwise have challenged Google\u2019s dominance,\u201d YC wrote in the filing. \u201cThe result is a landscape that has been artificially stunted and stagnant.\u201d\nYC\u2019s brief says it\u2019s currently seeking to fund startups developing question-based and agentic AI tools that could transform how people interact with information on the internet. But YC says there\u2019s a \u201cclear risk\u201d that Google will use its monopoly power to slow down the future of those markets.\n\u201cGoogle has effectively frozen the web search and text advertising markets for over a decade,\u201d YC wrote.\nThe brief, filed May 9, was spotted on X by VC Sheel Mohnot, the general partner of Better Tomorrow Ventures and a prolific social media poster.\nBut YC isn\u2019t calling for an immediate breakup of Google, as its CEO Garry Tan made clear in a reply to Mohnot.\nTechcrunch event Join us at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot for our leading AI industry event with speakers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere. For a limited time, tickets are just $292 for an entire day of expert talks, workshops, and potent networking. Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend. Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | REGISTER NOW\nRather, YC is arguing Google should curb practices it considers anti-competitive, like paying Apple billions of dollars to make Google the iPhone\u2019s default search engine. It also wants Google to do things it argues would help startups, like opening up Google\u2019s search index so others can train LLMs on it.\nFor perspective, Google\u2019s search algorithms have been its highly prized secret since its inception. For YC to ask the government to force Google to open it up to competitive LLMs is almost like demanding the government make Microsoft Windows open source, or forcing Amazon to freely deliver packages for competitors.\nIf Google doesn\u2019t implement such changes within a five-year time frame, then YC advocates for the government to force Google to divest or spin out parts of itself. YC CEO Tan characterized this idea in an X post as a \u201cspinoff hammer\u201d threat. He also posted that \u201cwe love Google\u201d but wants \u201clittle tech\u201d to succeed, too, in a separate X thread.\nYC released an amicus brief re: US v Google yesterday.\nWe love Google and what it represents as a paragon of US-led tech and innovation. We also want to make sure the excesses of big tech make way for tomorrow's little tech. \u2014 Garry Tan (@garrytan) May 10, 2025\nTo recap, last year Google lost a massive antitrust case over its dominance of the search market. While Google appeals the decision, the U.S. government is mulling potential punishments (\u201cremedies\u201d) that Google might be required to implement, such as spinning off Chrome. Those remedies are expected to be delivered by August 2025.\nYC\u2019s stance may come as a surprise to those who have followed its latest partnerships with Google: Most notably, Google Cloud gave YC startups access to a dedicated cluster of Nvidia GPUs last year. Google co-founder Larry Page also made a rare in-person appearance to speak at a YC event in December.\nGoogle has also acquired at least two YC-backed startups: Flutter in 2014, and Fridge in 2011. It also invested in YC startup Infisical through its Gradient fund in 2023.\nHowever, YC is also closely tied to OpenAI, which is now directly competing against Google on search. OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman used to run YC, while OpenAI was the first group affiliated with YC Research.\nThat\u2019s something Mohnot pointed to on X, writing that the biggest beneficiary of YC\u2019s proposed remedies, by far, would be OpenAI, rather than YC\u2019s famously early-stage startups, while commenting that the amicus brief \u201cpaints Google as more powerful than it is.\u201d\nTechCrunch asked YC how it would respond to this critique, and whether it has any specific examples of areas that it probably would have funded had it not been for Google. So far, YC hasn\u2019t responded to our comment request.\nGoogle didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about YC\u2019s amicus brief, either. However, it argued in a blog post last year that the DOJ\u2019s proposals are \u201cradical and sweeping\u201d and would hurt consumers, business, and developers.\n\ntitle3:\nApple announces new accessibility features, including future support for brain implants\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nApple on Tuesday announced a range of accessibility features coming to its devices later this year.\nNew Accessibility Nutrition Labels will provide more detailed information for apps and games on the App Store, while a new Braille Access tool will turn the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro into a braille notetaker.\nAdditional enhancements include Accessibility Reader, a system-wide reading mode designed with accessibility in mind; a new Apple TV accessibility app, Assistive Access; shareable accessibility settings; and updates to Live Listen, Background Sounds, Personal Voice, and Vehicle Motion Cues.\nThe upgrades arrive as Apple partners with the startup Synchron to help disabled users navigate its software. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company is also developing a new protocol, Switch Control, to enable people to control their iPhones as well as other devices with neural signals captured by brain implants.\n\ntitle4:\nAWS enters into 'strategic partnership' with Saudi Arabia-backed Humain\ndescription4:\nAmazon says it will work with Humain, the AI company recently launched by Saudi Arabia\u2019s ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, to invest \u201c$5 billion-plus\u201d in a strategic partnership to build an \u201cAI Zone\u201d in Saudi Arabia.\nThe AI Zone will include dedicated Amazon Web Services (AWS) AI infrastructure, servers, networks, and training and certification programs, according to a press release. Humain is pledging to develop AI solutions using AWS technologies and to work with AWS on providing access to tools and programs for Saudi Arabia-based AI startups.\nAWS joins tech giants Nvidia, AMD, and others in partnering with Humain, which is funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund (PIF). American tech firms have looked to the PIF as a source of capital. Companies like Google and Salesforce have also recently worked with the PIF on AI-related projects and investments.\nPresident Donald Trump and several tech industry allies attended a U.S.-Saudi investment forum on Tuesday. Under a new Trump administration initiative, U.S.-based tech suppliers, including Nvidia and AMD, have been permitted to arrange deals with Saudi Arabian firms.\nSaudi Arabia has mandated AI companies and services in the kingdom store data locally, pushing vendors to put facilities there to avoid losing contracts. Both Google and Oracle have announced expansion plans in the region over the past year.\nAmazon early last March pledged to spend billions of dollars on data centers in Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, the company said it is devoting around $5.3 billion to develop an AWS region in the kingdom scheduled to come online in 2026. The AI Zone commitments are an \u201cadditional investment\u201d separate from the roughly $5.3 billion, Amazon said. It isn\u2019t clear, however, if Amazon\u2019s contribution to the AI Zone will draw on the tranche the company originally announced.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Amazon for clarification and will update this piece if we hear back.\"\n\nResponse:",
