Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday March 11), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nIn another chess move with Microsoft, OpenAI is pouring $12B into CoreWeave\ndescription0:\nIn a grandmaster-level chess move, OpenAI has signed a five-year, $11.9 billion agreement with the GPU-heavy cloud service provider CoreWeave, according to Reuters, which cites people close to the deal.\nThe deal involves OpenAI receiving $350 million worth of equity in CoreWeave, the sources told Reuters. The private placement is said to be separate from CoreWeave\u2019s planned IPO.\nCoreWeave filed to become a public company last week, but it has not yet priced or scheduled its debut.\nIt\u2019s a win for both companies. One reason this agreement is so eye-popping (besides the billions involved) is that before this deal, CoreWeave\u2019s biggest customer was Microsoft. In fact, in 2024, Microsoft accounted for 62% of CoreWeave\u2019s revenue, which grew to a stunning $1.9 billion \u2014 nearly an eightfold increase from just $228.9 million in 2023.\nBacked by Nvidia, which holds a 6% stake, CoreWeave runs an AI-specific cloud service with a network of 32 data centers that operated more than 250,000 Nvidia GPUs as of the end of 2024, according to the company. Since then, CoreWeave has added more GPUs, including Nvidia\u2019s latest product, Blackwell, which supports AI reasoning, the company said.\nSuch dependence on one customer is usually worrisome for IPO investors and could have added \u201chair\u201d as they say, to CoreWeave\u2019s hopes of raising $4 billion or more in its IPO. Landing OpenAI as a direct customer in a multi-billion-dollar deal should help CoreWeave appease investors.\nMicrosoft and OpenAI\u2019s relationship\nWhat makes this move equally interesting is that it\u2019s another step in the deteriorating, frenemies relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI.\nIt\u2019s as if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman saw Microsoft\u2019s usage of CoreWeave and said, \u201cHold my beer.\u201d\nNot only will OpenAI have access to the same cloud, but it will also have an ownership stake in the company that runs it.\nMicrosoft is, of course, a big backer of OpenAI in a deal that entitles Microsoft to collect a portion of OpenAI\u2019s revenue. But tensions between two companies have been rising for years, as OpenAI\u2019s fortunes have soared. OpenAI competes with Microsoft for enterprise customers and is even reportedly working on rolling out pricey AI agents.\nIn January, as part of the massive Stargate AI infrastructure deal with SoftBank, Oracle, and others, Microsoft ceased being OpenAI\u2019s sole cloud provider. OpenAI needs more compute resources. Just last week, Altman complained that OpenAI is \u201cout of GPUs.\u201d\nFor its part, Microsoft is working on its own AI \u201creasoning\u201d models comparable to OpenAI\u2019s o1 and o3-mini. It\u2019s developing a whole family of its own models called MAI that are competitive with OpenAI. It also hired Altman\u2019s rival, Mustafa Suleyman, to lead Microsoft AI.\nBut CoreWeave is a surprising chess piece.\nCoreWeave began its life as a crypto mining operation, founded by former hedge fund guys, it said. The three co-founders have already cashed out of $488 million worth of shares \u2014 over $150 million apiece. CoreWeave also has a stunning $7.9 billion of debt on the books.\nIf the IPO generates the billions of new capital they hope it will, the company says it will use at least some of that to pay down the debt.\nWhile these founders were once literally attempting to use GPUs to mint money, they are figuratively apparently accomplishing it.\nCoreWeave and OpenAI did not respond to our request for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nElon Musk says X is down due to cyberattacks\ndescription1:\nElon Musk\u2019s X was inaccessible on Monday morning for thousands of users, including many in the U.S. After about eight hours of outages, Musk posted that the platform is facing a \u201cmassive cyberattack.\u201d\n\u201cThere was (still is) a massive cyberattack against \ud835\udd4f. We get attacked every day, but this was done with a lot of resources. Either a large, coordinated group and/or a country is involved. Tracing \u2026\u201d he wrote on X.\nImage Credits:Elon Musk on X\nIn a live interview with Fox News on Monday, Musk said the alleged cyberattack against X seemed to come from IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.\nThough there is no evidence of Musk\u2019s claims beyond his word, it\u2019s not far-fetched to believe that his platform would be vulnerable to cyberattacks. Musk has become more prominent and controversial than ever under President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, as he has personally led his team called \u201cDOGE\u201d through haphazard cuts to government funding, jobs, and international aid programs.\nTesla stores have also been subject to protests over Musk\u2019s outsized, unelected role in the government, with the stock of Musk\u2019s car company dropping as well.\nAccording to Downdetector, a website that tracks users\u2019 reports of online outages, X went down for some users around 5:30 a.m. ET, with more than 20,000 users reporting outages. Though these outages seemed to have resolved after about an hour, the outages returned around 9:30 a.m. ET, with more than 40,000 users reporting issues. Though some users were able to access X intermittently, the issues continued past 1:30 PM ET.\nOccasional outages are normal for platforms of this size but are never convenient for their users. Lamented one user in the comments on Downdetector, \u201con day 1 of the NFL free agency!? ELON Fix this.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nEric Schmidt joins Relativity Space as CEO\ndescription2:\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt is taking over as the CEO of Relativity Space, a 9-year-old rocket startup, a company spokesperson confirmed in a statement to TechCrunch. This is Schmidt\u2019s first CEO job since he left Google nearly 15 years ago.\nOn Monday, Schmidt told employees of Relativity Space that he made a significant investment and had taken a controlling stake in the company, The New York Times first reported.\nSchmidt is succeeding the startup\u2019s co-founder, Tim Ellis, as chief executive. In a post on X, Ellis noted he will continue to support Relativity Space as a director on the company\u2019s board.\nSchmidt is joining Relativity Space right as the company gears up for the 2026 launch of Terran R, a larger rocket than what the startup has launched before, that would compete with SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. In anticipation of Terran R\u2019s first launch, Relativity Space has struck nearly $3 billion in launch contracts with customers, the Times reported.\nSchmidt was the CEO of Google for roughly 10 years. He was brought on to lead the rapidly growing search company in 2001, as Google\u2019s board pressured its young founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, to allow an experienced business leader to take the reins.\nNow, Schmidt will become CEO of Relativity Space at a critical moment in the company\u2019s history. He may offer the rocket startup both capital and experience to help guide it through the launch of Terran R. Additionally, Schmidt is quite well-connected in Washington, D.C., which could potentially assist Relativity Space in working with government officials on future launches.\nRelativity Space is known for producing its rockets with unusual techniques, including the use of 3D printers, automated robots, and artificial intelligence. The company previously announced a plan to launch the first private space mission to Mars by 2024. However, certain challenges have delayed those audacious milestones.\nIn 2023, Relativity Space successfully launched its Terran 1 rocket, demonstrating that its 3D-printed technology could function effectively. However, Terran 1 failed to reach orbit. A month later, the startup announced that it would discontinue Terran 1 to focus entirely on developing the Terran R.\nThe Long Beach-based rocket company reportedly faced cash shortages in 2024 and struggled to raise additional funding, Bloomberg previously reported. Previous investors in Relativity Space include Mark Cuban, BlackRock, and Fidelity.\nWhile running a rocket company is quite different from managing a search engine company, Schmidt has proven to be a valuable operator who can effectively grow startups in the past. With fierce competition in the space industry \u2014 from companies such as SpaceX, Rocket Lab, and Blue Origin \u2014 it seems Relativity Space could benefit from someone like Schmidt at the helm.\n\ntitle3:\nRocket Companies to acquire Redfin for $1.75B\ndescription3:\nRedfin is being acquired in an all-stock transaction that values the real estate listing platform at $1.75 billion.\nThe acquiring company is Rocket Companies, a Detroit, Michigan-based finance and real estate holding firm that owns various brands, including Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Money (formerly Truebill), and Rocket Loans.\nThe combined entity will essentially pool the two companies\u2019 respective strengths in home search services and financing.\n\u201cRocket and Redfin\u2019s approaches to lending and brokerage service have always been two halves of one vision to make the whole home-buying process magical,\u201d Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman said in a statement. \u201cWe want a customer to be able to check her phone to find out what she can afford, see which homes are just right for her, schedule a tour with a local, expert Redfin agent, and get pre-qualified for a loan, all in a matter of minutes.\u201d\nFounded in Seattle in 2004, Redfin runs a residential real estate brokerage platform for the U.S. and Canadian markets. The self-proclaimed \u201cAmazon of real estate\u201d went public in 2017, and its shares generally traded flat at around $20 in the subsequent few years. But as with many tech companies, Redfin soared during the pandemic, with its stock hitting an all-time high of $96 in early 2021, before plummeting to below $10 for much of the past three years.\nRedfin\u2019s shares had slipped more than 30% in the past couple of weeks after its Q4 2024 earnings missed analysts\u2019 expectations and its current-quarter forecast was considered weak.\nRocket Companies, for its part, went public in 2020, and today has a market cap of $31 billion. The company\u2019s proposed bid of $12.50 per share represents a 63% premium over Redfin\u2019s volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the month leading up to March 7, 2025. The offer entails exchanging 0.7926 shares of Rocket Companies\u2019 Class A stock for each share of Redfin common stock, with Rocket Companies\u2019 shareholders owning 95% of the new combined entity and Redfin shareholders owning 5%.\nWhile both boards of directors have already approved the transaction, it does still require Redfin\u2019s shareholders to rubberstamp the deal, which Redfin says it expects to happen in Q3, 2025. Kelman, who has led Redfin since 2005, will continue at the helm and report to Rocket\u2019s CEO, Varun Krishna.\nThis article was updated to clarify that Redfin will remain a public company as part of Rocket Companies.\n\ntitle4:\nBluesky is weighing a proposal that gives users consent over how their data is used for AI\ndescription4:\nSpeaking at the SXSW conference in Austin on Monday, Bluesky CEO Jay Graber said the social network has been working on a framework for user consent over how they want their data to be used for generative AI.\nThe public nature of Bluesky\u2019s social network has already allowed others to train their AI systems on users\u2019 content, as was discovered last year when 404 Media came across a dataset built from 1 million Bluesky posts hosted on Hugging Face.\nBluesky competitor X, meanwhile, is feeding users\u2019 posts into sister company xAI to help train its AI chatbot Grok. Last fall, it changed its privacy policy to allow third parties to train their AI on users\u2019 X posts, as well. The move, followed by the U.S. elections that elevated X owner Elon Musk\u2019s status within the Trump administration, helped fuel another exodus of users from X to Bluesky.\nAs a result, Bluesky\u2019s open source, decentralized X alternative has grown to over 32 million users in just two years\u2019 time.\nHowever, the demand for AI training data means the new social network has to think about its AI policy, even though it doesn\u2019t plan to train its own AI systems on users\u2019 posts.\nSpeaking at SXSW, Graber explained that the company has engaged with partners to develop a framework for user consent over how they would want their data to be used \u2014 or not used \u2014 for generative AI.\n\u201cWe really believe in user choice,\u201d Graber said, saying that users would be able to specify how they want their Bluesky content to be used.\n\u201cIt could be something similar to how websites specify whether they want to be scraped by search engines or not,\u201d she continued.\n\u201cSearch engines can still scrape websites, whether or not you have this, because websites are open on the public internet. But in general, this robots.txt file gets respected by a lot of search engines,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you need something to be widely adopted and to have users and companies and regulators to go with this framework. But I think it\u2019s something that could work here.\u201d\nThe proposal, which is currently on GitHub, would involve getting user consent at the account level or even at the post level, then ask other companies to respect that setting.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on it with other people in the space concerned about how AI is affecting how we view our data,\u201d Graber added. \u201cI think it\u2019s a positive direction to take.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
