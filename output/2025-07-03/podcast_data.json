Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

The bill, which is expected to be signed into law by Trump on July 4, will cause the federal EV tax credit to end in September \u2014 a $7,500 incentive that Slate had counted on to help its all-electric pickup clear that mark.\nWhen Slate came out of stealth mode in April, the startup heavily promoted that its all-electric pickup would start at \u201cunder $20,000\u201d with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit. That language was still on Slate\u2019s website as recently as yesterday according to the Web Archive.\nThe change is a potential blow to the young company\u2019s attempt to make a radically affordable electric vehicle.\nSlate didn\u2019t provide a precise price for the EV at its launch event; and it has yet to say what the actual starting price of its vehicle will be, sans-credit. A Slate spokesperson declined to comment on the change.\nThe company won\u2019t start building the truck until the end of 2026 at the earliest. Slate\u2019s business is also built around making this vehicle highly customizable, which means it\u2019s possible that few people will buy the base model to begin with.\nThe sub-$20,000 price had been a big attraction point for the brand new company\u2019s product, and it was a major focus following its April launch event.\nThe auto industry has \u201cdriven prices to a place that most Americans simply can\u2019t afford,\u201d chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said during the event. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to change that.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,\u201d CEO Chris Barman added at the time.\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle rolls out its new Veo 3 video-generation model globally\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nGoogle on Thursday said it has begun rolling out its Veo 3 video generation model to Gemini users in more than 159 countries.\nVideo generation via the new model is available only to paying subscribers of Google\u2019s AI Pro plan and is capped at three videos per day.\nVeo 3, which Google showed off in May, lets users generate videos up to eight seconds long using text prompts.\nGoogle\u2019s Josh Woodward has said that the company is working on adding image-to-video generation capabilities to Gemini.\n\ntitle2:\nStripe\u2019s first employee, the founder of fintech Increase, sort of bought a bank\ndescription2:\nIt\u2019s an open secret in the fintech world that the founder and CEO of startup Increase, Darragh Buckley, has been trying for years to \u201cbuy a bank,\u201d as one person familiar with the landscape told TechCrunch.\nA couple of weeks ago, he basically succeeded.\nHe bought a big enough stake in Twin City Bank to trigger a public disclosure of the transaction by the Federal Reserve Board. Such share purchases are then subject to FDIC approval. Twin City is a small community bank in Longview, Washington, about an hour north of Portland, Oregon. The stake had to be in excess of 10% to trigger the disclosure.\nBuckley confirmed the deal to TechCrunch but declined to say how big of a stake he purchased. Whether he owns 11% or, say, 51%, we understand he is not the sole owner. Still, anything upward of 10% makes him a major shareholder. (For comparison, public companies have to disclose all ownership stakes of 5% or more.)\nThe assumption in the industry was that Buckley wanted a bank to further the ambitions of Increase, his banking-as-a-service (BaaS) startup, multiple sources told TechCrunch.\nWhat\u2019s particularly wild is that a mysterious entity \u2014 most likely one of Buckley\u2019s competitors \u2014 was so opposed to this deal that it hired an agency to pitch the press on writing negative stories about it and him.\nBut, Buckley told TechCrunch, this was actually his third investment in a Washington community bank and his interests are not what his competitors think.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nThis is not an effort for Increase to own the bank, he said. \u201cTwin City Bank is, and will remain, a community-focused bank,\u201d he said.\nSilicon Valley finds a banking shortcut\nIncrease offers an API platform that allows financial services to be programmatically served. It performs tasks like automated clearing house transactions, wires, real-time payments, etc. Increase\u2019s customers are largely other fintechs like Ramp, Check, and Pipe.\nAs Stripe\u2019s first employee, Buckley has \u201ca great reputation as an engineer among his peers,\u201d one person in the fintech industry told TechCrunch. Even some BaaS competitors refer business to Increase when they can\u2019t handle it themselves.\nLike most fintechs, Increase partners with (and shares revenue with) FDIC-insured banks to offer such regulated services. Obtaining banking licenses themselves is difficult and expensive. Even Chime, which offers checking and savings accounts and recently had an IPO, is not an FDIC-insured bank but has banking partners.\nIn Increase\u2019s case, it works with Grasshopper Bank and First Internet Bank of Indiana. (Buckley said he has no personal investment in either one.)\nHowever, BaaS is a crowded, competitive market. That\u2019s led a small number of them to find a workaround to stand out: buying small community banks directly and doing away with banking partners.\nThe biggest example of this is William Hockey, co-founder of Plaid, whose current fintech, Column, bought Northern California National Bank for $50 million in 2021. Another example is a Kansas City bank called Lead, bought and led by former Block executives Jackie Reses, Lead\u2019s CEO, and Ronak Vyas, CTO.\nThe dangers of fintech partnerships\nBuckley insists he has no plans to turn Twin City into his company\u2019s personal partner bank or to swell its revenues with lots of fintech partners like Increase\u2019s customers. The latter, he knows, can be dangerous.\nFor example, Evolve Bank \u2014 a partner to many fintechs, from Affirm to Stripe \u2014 was the target of a large ransomware attack in 2024. This was shortly after the Federal Reserve System issued a cease-and-desist consent order to Evolve over problems it found with the bank\u2019s risk management systems. Evolve was ordered to implement pages of compliance fixes. (The bank was also associated with the meltdown of BaaS startup Synapse.)\n\u201cTwin City Bank shouldn\u2019t support sponsor banking,\u201d Buckley explained, referring to banking partnerships with fintechs. \u201cSponsor banking requires very specific capability and capacity to supervise partners safely and soundly. Only specialized banks should do it.\u201d\nSo why make such a big investment if not to benefit Increase? Because he likes community banks. They are the underdogs of the banking world.\n\u201cThere\u2019s perhaps a prevalent view in the financial technology industry that community banks can\u2019t grow on their own. But community banks\u2019 strength is their relationships and knowledge,\u201d he said.\nIf Buckley\u2019s plan for the bank ever changes, his BaaS competitors will be watching. As for the mysterious entity hoping to stop him: It\u2019s too late. He said he received the FDIC\u2019s \u201cnon-objection for control\u201d approval and the deal has already closed.\n\ntitle3:\nWho is Soham Parekh, the serial moonlighter Silicon Valley startups can't stop hiring?\ndescription3:\nIn the last week, social media users have shared dozens of stories about encounters with Soham Parekh, a software engineer who seems to have been simultaneously working at multiple Silicon Valley startups \u2014 unbeknownst to the companies \u2014 for the last several years.\nBut who is Parekh, how did he pull off his career as a serial moonlighter, and why can\u2019t Silicon Valley get enough of him?\nOrigins of virality\nThe saga all started when Suhail Doshi \u2014 CEO of image generation startup Playground AI \u2014 shared a post Tuesday on X that began: \u201cPSA: there\u2019s a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He\u2019s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware.\u201d\nDoshi claims that, roughly a year ago, he fired Parekh from Playground AI after he found out he was working at other companies. \u201c[I] told him to stop lying/scamming people. He hasn\u2019t stopped a year later,\u201d Doshi wrote.\nPSA: there\u2019s a guy named Soham Parekh (in India) who works at 3-4 startups at the same time. He\u2019s been preying on YC companies and more. Beware.\nI fired this guy in his first week and told him to stop lying / scamming people. He hasn\u2019t stopped a year later. No more excuses. \u2014 Suhail (@Suhail) July 2, 2025\nThat post from Doshi received roughly 20 million views and prompted several other founders to share their run-ins with Parekh as well.\nFlo Crivello, the CEO of Lindy, a startup that helps people automate their workflows with AI, said he hired Parekh in recent weeks, but fired him in light of Doshi\u2019s tweet.\nHoly shit. We hired this guy a week ago. Fired this morning. He did so incredibly well in interviews, must have a lot of training. Careful out there. https://t.co/XP33febCYs \u2014 Flo Crivello (@Altimor) July 2, 2025\nMatt Parkhurst, the CEO of Antimetal, a startup that uses AI to cut down on enterprises\u2019 cloud spending, confirmed that Parekh was the company\u2019s first engineering hire in 2022. He said Antimetal quickly let Parekh go after they realized he was moonlighting at other companies.\nTechcrunch event Save $450 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter. Scale faster.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nFunnily enough, Soham was our first engineering hire in 2022\nReally smart and likable; enjoyed working with him\nWe realized pretty quickly that he was working at multiple companies and let him go\nI can\u2019t imagine the amount of equity he\u2019s left on the table https://t.co/vXGlHxF1QH \u2014 Matt (@mprkhrst) July 2, 2025\nParekh also seems to have worked at Sync Labs, a startup that makes an AI lip-synching tool, where he even starred in a promotional video. He was ultimately let go.\nAt some point, Parekh applied to several Y Combinator-backed startups. Haz Hubble, the co-founder of Pally AI, a Y Combinator-backed startup building an \u201cAI relationship management platform,\u201d says he offered Parekh a founding engineer role. Adish Jain, the co-founder of YC-backed Mosaic \u2014 an AI video editing startup \u2014 said he interviewed Parekh for a role, too.\nTechCrunch has reached out to these companies for comment, but they did not immediately respond.\nsomething weird about when we offered soham\u2026\nhe was very pro-equity vs salary\nlike dramatically so\nmaybe because he knows that\u2019s what founders wanna hear?\nbut it doesn\u2019t fit with trying to earn as much money as possible if he knows he\u2019s gonna get fired shortly after\ni\u2026 \u2014 Haz Hubble (@hazhubble) July 2, 2025\nIt turns out that Parekh did quite well in many of these interviews and received offers, largely because he\u2019s a gifted software engineer.\nFor instance, Rohan Pandey, a founding research engineer of the YC-backed startup Reworkd, told TechCrunch that he interviewed Parekh for a role and he was a strong candidate. Pandey, who is no longer with the startup, says Parekh was one of the top three performers on an algorithms-focused interview they gave candidates.\nPandey said the Reworkd team suspected something was off with Parekh. At the time, Parekh told Reworkd he was in the U.S. \u2014 a requirement for the job \u2014 but the company didn\u2019t believe him. They ran an IP logger on a Zoom link from Parekh and located him in India.\nomg just remembered my fav soham parekh story\ncall 1: says he\u2019s in US but we suspect he\u2019s in india\ncall 2: we call his bs, he admits \u201cwas in india last week to visit family, but now back in US\u201d\ncall 3: @asimdotshrestha puts an IP logger on zoom link and it shows up in mumbai \ud83d\udc80 https://t.co/Skclonmtx2 \u2014 Rohan Pandey (@khoomeik) July 3, 2025\nPandey recalled other things Parekh said often didn\u2019t add up, and some of his GitHub contributions and previous roles didn\u2019t quite make sense either. That seems to be a common experience when dealing with Parekh.\nAdam Silverman, co-founder of the AI agent observability startup, Agency, told TechCrunch his company also interviewed Parekh. Silverman said Parekh sent him a cold DM about a job opening at Agency, and they set up a meeting. Parekh had to reschedule that meeting five times, according to Silverman and emails from Parekh viewed by TechCrunch.\nSilverman says he was also impressed by Parekh\u2019s technical ability, but in the interview, he insisted on working remotely. Much like with Reworkd, that was a red flag for Agency.\nRoy Lee, the CEO of the \u201ccheat on everything\u201d AI startup, Cluely, tells TechCrunch he interviewed Parekh twice for a role. Lee said Parekh interviews quite well and \u201cseemed to have strong react knowledge,\u201d referencing a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\nLee says Cluely did not end up hiring Parekh. However, several other companies clearly did.\nParekh\u2019s perspective\nParekh made an appearance on the Technology Business Programming Network (TBPN) on Thursday to tell co-hosts John Coogan and Jordi Hays his side of the story and explain why he\u2019s worked at so many companies.\nHe admitted that he\u2019s been working at multiple jobs simultaneously since 2022. Parekh claims he was not using AI tools or hiring junior software engineers to assist him with his workload.\nAll that work has made Parekh a much better programmer, he believes, but notes that it\u2019s taken a toll.\nParekh said he\u2019s notorious among his friends for not sleeping. He repeated several times throughout the interview that he works 140 hours a week, which comes out to 20 hours a day, seven days a week. That seems to be borderline impossible \u2014 or at the very least, extremely unhealthy and unsustainable.\nParekh also said he took multiple jobs because he was in \u201cfinancial jeopardy,\u201d implying he needed all the income he could get from his various employers. He claims he deferred going to a graduate school program he had been accepted to, and instead decided to work at several startups simultaneously.\nNotably, Doshi shared a copy of Parekh\u2019s resum\u00e9 that claims he received a masters degree from Georgia Institute of Technology.\nWhen TBPN\u2019s co-hosts asked why Parekh didn\u2019t just ask one company to raise his salary and help with his financial struggles, Parekh said he liked to keep a boundary between his professional and private life. (But he had also opted for low salaries and high equity at all his jobs, which doesn\u2019t quite add up with his financial crisis story. However, Parekh declined to share more about it.)\nParekh told the hosts he genuinely loved his work, and it was not solely about the money. He says he was very invested in the missions of all the companies where he worked.\nHe also admitted that he\u2019s not proud of what he\u2019s done, and he doesn\u2019t endorse it.\nWhat now?\nSome are calling Parekh a scam artist and a liar, but in classic Silicon Valley fashion, Parekh appears to be trying to turn his viral moment into a business.\nParekh announced his newest employer, which he claims to be exclusively working at: Darwin Studios, a startup working on AI video remixing.\nHowever, Parekh quickly deleted the post after announcing it, as did the founder and CEO of the startup, Sanjit Juneja.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Parekh requesting an interview regarding this article, however, he has not yet accepted. Instead, a spokesperson representing him sent TechCrunch a statement from Darwin\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cSoham is an incredibly talented engineer and we believe in his abilities to help bring our products to market,\u201d said Juneja.\nWe\u2019ve seen countless startups turn their viral, often controversial, moments into businesses in the last year. One of the most famous is Cluely, which is known for creating provocative marketing campaigns. It\u2019s rage bait, but it\u2019s attention-grabbing, and it was enough to land Cluely a $15 million seed round from Andreessen Horowitz.\nPerhaps Parekh will land a similar fortune in the future.\nUpdate 8:12pm PT: This story initially cited a previous name the TBPN show went by.
