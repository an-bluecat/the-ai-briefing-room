Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

Wang says Meta\u2019s research teams will collaborate with Midjourney to bring its technology into future AI models and products.\n\u201cTo ensure Meta is able to deliver the best possible products for people it will require taking an all-of-the-above approach,\u201d Wang said. \u201cThis means world-class talent, ambitious compute roadmap, and working with the best players across the industry.\u201d\nThe Midjourney partnership could help Meta develop products that compete with industry-leading AI image and video models, such as OpenAI\u2019s Sora, Black Forest Lab\u2019s Flux, and Google\u2019s Veo. Last year, Meta rolled out its own AI image generation tool, Imagine, into several of its products, including Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. Meta also has an AI video generation tool, Movie Gen, that allows users to create videos from prompts.\nThe licensing agreement with Midjourney marks Meta\u2019s latest deal to get ahead in the AI race. Earlier this year, CEO Mark Zuckerberg went on a hiring spree for AI talent, offering some researchers compensation packages worth upwards of $100 million. The social media giant also invested $14 billion in Scale AI, and acquired the AI voice startup Play AI.\nMeta has held talks with several other leading AI labs about other acquisitions, and Zuckerberg even spoke with Elon Musk about joining his $97 billion takeover bid of OpenAI (Meta ultimately did not join the offer, and OpenAI denied Musk\u2019s bid).\nWhile the terms of Meta\u2019s deal with Midjourney remain unknown, the startup\u2019s CEO, David Holz, said in a post on X that his company remains independent with no investors; Midjourney is one of the few leading AI model developers that has never taken on outside funding. At one point, Meta talked with Midjourney about acquiring the startup, according to Upstarts Media.\nMidjourney was founded in 2022 and quickly became a leader in the AI image generation space for its realistic, unique style. By 2023, the startup was reportedly on pace to generate $200 million in revenue. The startup sells subscriptions starting at $10 per month. It offers pricier tiers, which offer more AI image generations, that cost as much as $120 per month. In June, the startup released its first AI video model, V1.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

With the release of Apple\u2019s software updates arriving in September, the tech giant is adding another option for enterprise customers: the ability to configure the use of an enterprise version of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nApple has already seen the demand for ChatGPT for Enterprise, which OpenAI says now has over 5 million business customers. These companies use the AI service to connect with their own internal data when using AI agents.\nHowever, what\u2019s interesting about the way Apple\u2019s integration with ChatGPT for Enterprise has been structured is that it\u2019s not hard-coded to only restrict or allow ChatGPT itself.\nInstead, Apple\u2019s support documents indicate that IT administrators will be able to restrict or allow any \u201cexternal\u201d artificial intelligence provider, not just OpenAI\u2019s technology. That leaves the door open for Apple to forge other deals with large AI players used in the enterprise environment, without having to recode things at the protocol level.\nAs Apple has rolled out new AI features aimed at its devices\u2019 end users \u2014 like writing tools or visual intelligence, for example \u2014 it\u2019s also rolled out ways for IT departments to control access to those features.\nWhile the company fully believes in its Private Cloud Compute architecture, it knows that it can take time for companies to agree to make changes to sensitive systems and data. That\u2019s why it leaves it up to businesses to decide if data should be processed in the cloud or on the device, for example.\nIn addition to letting businesses pick and choose which AI features to enable, this setup allows businesses to decide whether employees\u2019 AI requests can go to ChatGPT\u2019s cloud service, even when the business doesn\u2019t have its own enterprise deal with OpenAI. (ChatGPT, you\u2019ll recall, has been integrated with Apple Intelligence across Apple\u2019s software platform to handle AI requests that Apple\u2019s own cloud can\u2019t. Because requests never go from Apple\u2019s cloud to ChatGPT directly \u2014 it\u2019s either/or \u2014 it\u2019s easier to disable the ChatGPT setting.)\nWhile AI updates are a highlight of the enterprise-related updates due out in the fall, Apple is also rolling out other new features to its largest customers.\nIt will launch an API for its Apple Business Manager service, which will allow the service\u2019s functions to be integrated into other IT tools, like MDM products, inventory management services, or help desks, among others. It\u2019s also debuting new tools for Device Management to make it easier to migrate devices to a different management service \u2014 something that often comes up in M&A scenarios when a new company takes over employee devices and assets.\nApple\u2019s Return to Service solution, which lets devices quickly get wiped and readied for the next user, will now offer the option to leave all apps installed, saving time and bandwidth since IT admins and users won\u2019t need to reinstall them. Plus, Return to Service will become available for Vision Pro for the first time.\nOn shared Macs, an authenticated Guest Mode lets employees log in with account credentials from their identity provider, then has their data (but not apps) erased upon logout. Another option lets businesses add NFC readers to Macs, so employees can just tap their watch or phone to log in.\nThese tools will also roll out in September as part of Apple\u2019s broader software updates for iPhone, iPad, Mac and more.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Bloomberg was first to report the news, which pushed the semiconductor chip company\u2019s stock up more than 7%. Trump said Intel has agreed to the proposal.\nIntel declined to comment.\nThe news comes during a pivotal \u2014 and recently volatile \u2014 time for Intel. CEO Lip-Bu Tan is currently restructuring the chipmaker, shuttering certain divisions and laying off workers in a bid to focus on its core businesses and catch up to rivals like Nvidia.\nEarlier this month, Trump pushed Tan to resign because of perceived conflicts of interest. Tan later met with Trump to find out a way to assuage the president and figure out ways for the company and government to work together.\nWhile speaking to the White House press pool, Trump acknowledged the resignation push.\n\u201cI said well if that\u2019s right he should resign and he came in and he saw me we talked for a while. I liked him a lot,\u201d Trump said, according to emailed comments from the press pool. \u201cI thought he was very good. I thought he was somewhat a victim but you know nobody\u2019s a total victim I guess, and I said, you know what, I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel. And he said, I would consider that. I said, well, I\u2019d like you to do that because Intel\u2019s been left behind as, you know, compared to Jensen. And some of our friends Nvidia.\u201d\nTrump continued, \u201cI said I think it would be good having the United States as your partner. He agreed. And they\u2019ve agreed to do it and I think it\u2019s a great deal for them and I think it\u2019s a great deal.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nSuch federal government ownership of a major corporation would mark a dramatic departure from long-standing U.S. policy. Government equity stakes in private companies are extremely rare in the U.S. and highly controversial, with notable exceptions occurring during the 2008-2009 financial crisis when the government took temporary ownership stakes in companies like General Motors, AIG, and a few major banks to prevent economic collapse.\nThe government systematically sold those stakes back to private investors over the following several years.\nThe Intel deal, which is expected to be announced later Friday, comes days after the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank agreed to make a $2 billion investment in Intel. That deal was couched as a commitment to advanced technology and semiconductors in the U.S. Under that agreement, SoftBank agreed to buy Intel common stock at $23 per share. Intel shares were trading around $25 on Friday afternoon.\nTechCrunch has reached out to the White House for comment.\nWe\u2019re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

China\u2019s government is urging companies to use domestic chips instead, The Information reported.\nThis comes a month after companies including Nvidia were given the green light to start selling its AI chips designed for China\u2019s market.\nAn Nvidia spokesperson sent TechCrunch the following statement, \u201cWe constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions. Cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have \u2018backdoors\u2019 in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them.
