    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday April 28), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nTechCrunch Mobility: Slate\u2019s \u2018transformer\u2019 EV truck breaks cover and Tesla\u2019s dueling realities\ndescription0:\nWelcome back to TechCrunch Mobility \u2014 your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here for free \u2014 just click TechCrunch Mobility!\nBusy week, so let\u2019s get to it. Starting with federal regulations! Woohoo. Exciting stuff.\nI\u2019m talking about the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s new Automated Vehicle Framework, which includes a standing general order (SGO) on crash reporting for vehicles equipped with certain advanced driver-assistance systems and automated driving systems. There were also some changes to the Automated Vehicle Exemption Program (AVEP).\nBriefly, the AVEP handles language and processes of domestic and imported vehicles receiving exemptions. I want to spend a bit more time on the SGO, which has more significant changes. The Trump administration says it streamlines the process; others, like Consumer Reports, disagree.\nThe SGO ends a 24-hour reporting requirement and instead allows companies five days to submit a report if a vehicle with a Level 2 system is involved in a crash. As Consumer Reports notes, the new order also changes reporting requirements for when a vehicle with Level 2 driving automation has been towed away after a crash.\nIn the past, any vehicle with a Level 2 or above advanced driver-assistance system involved in a crash that DID NOT involve a fatality or hitting a vulnerable road user like a pedestrian or cyclist still had to report it within five days. Now the rule will only apply to vehicles with ADS (automated driving systems), which cuts out the bulk of vehicles on the road today.\nThat means if a Tesla that has Autopilot engaged (or a GM vehicle with Super Cruise or Ford with its BlueCruise system on) crashes and must be towed, it doesn\u2019t need to report that to the feds as long as the incident did not involve a fatality, an individual being transported to a hospital for medical treatment, a pedestrian or other vulnerable road user being struck, or an air bag deployment.\nReporting is still required for any vehicle with Level 2 ADAS (like Tesla Autopilot) or ADS that is in a crash in which there is a fatality, an air bag is deployed, a person is transported to the hospital, or a vulnerable road user is hit.\nDuring an interview at a Semafor event, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy seems to give a nod to those rules (although he says \u201cautonomous\u201d and not \u201cADAS\u201d) when he said, \u201cWhat we want to do is be able to get good data, but if there\u2019s a scraping of paint off of an autonomous vehicle, the reporting requirements became very laborious and challenging, and it slowed the process down.\u201d\nThink I got this wrong? Reach out.\nOK, on to the rest.\nA little bird\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nSlate, the Bezos-backed EV startup, broke cover at an event in Long Beach, California. Many of the details that senior reporter Sean O\u2019Kane reported in his initial scoop were finally presented to the public.\nEarlier in the week, we published some other insider details thanks to some little birds that describe how leaders have internally described the Slate EV as a \u201ctransformer\u201d \u2014 as in the animated \u201cmore than meets the eye\u201d series. Turns out, that is exactly what the company is pitching to customers.\nGot a tip for us?

Jay Park, co-founder and managing partner at Prysm, has joined Electra\u2019s board of directors.\nFora, a travel agent startup based in New York, raised $60 million across Series B and C rounds. Josh Kushner\u2019s Thrive co-led the $40 million Series C round.\nThe venture arm of United Airlines has invested an undisclosed amount in JetZero, a startup developing a blended wing body design.\nNotable reads and other tidbits\nImage Credits:Bryce Durbin\nAutonomous vehicles\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai received some attention for remarks during the company\u2019s earnings call about its self-driving vehicle unit Waymo. In response to a question, he said, as part of a longer answer, \u201cThere\u2019s future optionality around personal ownership as well.\u201d\nWaymo has talked vaguely about licensing its tech (presumably to automakers) before, so I wouldn\u2019t read too much into this. But it\u2019s certainly notable that Pichai said it in an earnings call.\nTesla has started testing its autonomous ride-hail service with employees in Austin and the Bay Area ahead of the company\u2019s planned robotaxi launch this summer.\nVolkswagen of America and Uber plan to launch a commercial robotaxi service \u2014 using autonomous electric VW ID. BUZZ vehicles \u2014 in multiple U.S. cities over the next decade.\nThe companies expect to launch a commercial service in Los Angeles by late 2026, although it will initially include human safety drivers. The news brought me back to 2017-18 \u2014 an era of partnership announcements, many of which never materialized. VW has a lot of work to do before it launches commercially, including gaining even the most basic testing permit.\nElectric vehicles, charging, & batteries\nAidan Gomez, the co-founder and CEO of generative AI startup Cohere, joined Rivian\u2019s board. I don\u2019t want to read too deeply into the appointment, but it does signal Rivian\u2019s interest in applying AI to its own venture while positioning itself as a software leader \u2014 and even provider \u2014 within the automotive industry.\nFaraday Future somehow still exists and its board has appointed founder Jia Yueting as the company\u2019s co-CEO, three years after he was sidelined following an internal probe into allegations of fraud. Side note: A Securities and Exchange Commission investigation remains ongoing.\nTesla earnings supported a hypothesis I\u2019ve had cooking in my brain for a while now. The company exists in contradictory realities. In one, Tesla\u2019s profits are down 71% YoY, automotive revenues continue to fall, and its energy business is exposed to the U.S.-China trade war. In the other, Tesla is really an AI company that finally has the attention of its CEO Elon Musk and is on the cusp of launching an autonomous vehicle ride-hailing service and a cheaper EV \u2014 although it has yet to do either.\nInvestors grabbed on to the Tesla-is-an-innovator reality with both hands and they really don\u2019t want to let go \u2014 even if the reality is that anti-Musk sentiment is affecting the brand and is even an official risk in its regulatory filing. Musk\u2019s comments about allocating more time to Tesla and less at DOGE helped push them there. If you want to catch up on all the nuggets in the earnings report and call, scroll through our Tesla earnings wrap-up.\nRide-hailing\nThe Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company charged customers for its Uber One subscription service without their consent.\nWhat is Lyft\u2019s loss is Uber\u2019s gain. Delta SkyMiles members in the United States can now start earning points when they ride with Uber or order delivery through Uber Eats as part of a recently announced exclusive partnership between the two companies. (Lyft had a partnership with Delta.)\n\ntitle1:\nEverything you need to know about the AI chatbot\ndescription1:\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it\u2019s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\nTo see a list of 2024 updates, go here.\nApril 2025\nOpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance\nOpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI\u2019s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\nOpenAI aims to make its new \u201copen\u201d AI model the best on the market\nOpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI\u2019s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step \u2014 sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 \u2014 claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that \u201cGPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won\u2019t be a separate system card released for it.\u201d\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI\u2019s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI\u2019s top-reported score.\nOpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.\nOpenAI\u2019s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks\nOpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI\u2019s safety report.\nOpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini\nOpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI\u2019s previous models.\nOpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers\nOpen AI introduced a new section called \u201clibrary\u201d to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company\u2019s X post.\nAll of your image creations, all in one place.\nIntroducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations\u2014rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) April 15, 2025\nOpenAI could \u201cadjust\u201d its safeguards if rivals release \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if \u201canother frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.\u201d The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\nOpenAI is building its own social media network\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s X and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\nOpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI\u2019s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\nOpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities\nOpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model \u2014 GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano \u2014 with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It\u2019s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek\u2019s upgraded V3.\nOpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT\u2019s GPT-4 at the end of April\nOpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI\u2019s API.\nOpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon\nOpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\nOpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\nOpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT\nIt looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new \u201cImageGen\u201d watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT\u2019s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: \u201cStructured Thoughts,\u201d \u201cReasoning Recap,\u201d \u201cCoT Search Tool,\u201d and \u201cl1239dk1.\u201d\nOpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students\nOpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI\u2019s premium service, which offers access to the company\u2019s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\nChatGPT users have generated over 700M images so far\nMore than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\nOpenAI\u2019s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI\u2019s o3 \u201creasoning\u201d model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company\u2019s new image-generation tool\u2019s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. \u201cWe are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,\u201d he wrote.\nMarch 2025\nOpenAI plans to release a new \u2018open\u2019 AI language model\nOpeanAI intends to release its \u201cfirst\u201d open language model since GPT-2 \u201cin the coming months.\u201d The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT\u2019s restrictions on image generation\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now \u201cevolved\u201d its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI\u2019s model behavior.\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic\u2019s standard for linking AI models with data\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic\u2019s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\nOpenAI\u2019s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cSpirited Away.\u201d The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn\u2019t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT\u2019s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI\u2019s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company\u2019s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company\u2019s API service. The company\u2019s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI\u2019s chief operating officer, will lead the company\u2019s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\nOpenAI\u2019s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company\u2019s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT\u2019s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are \u201cmore direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,\u201d a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.\nOpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India\nOpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI\u2019s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot\u2019s defamatory hallucinations\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. \u201cThe GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,\u201d said Joakim S\u00f6derberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. \u201cIf it\u2019s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn\u2019t enough. You can\u2019t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.\u201d\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, \u201cgpt-4o-mini-tts,\u201d that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called \u201cgpt-4o-transcribe\u201d and \u201cgpt-4o-mini-transcribe\u201d. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 \u201creasoning\u201d AI model to deliver \u201cconsistently better responses.\u201d It\u2019s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI \u201creasoning\u201d models could\u2019ve arrived decades ago\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for \u201creasoning\u201d could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a \u201cnew model\u201d that\u2019s \u201creally good\u201d at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt \u201cPlease write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.\u201d OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\nwe trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.\nPROMPT:\nPlease write a metafictional literary short story\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents \u2014 automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks \u2014 using the company\u2019s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI\u2019s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI\u2019s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI\u2019s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI \u2018agents\u2019\nOpenAI intends to release several \u201cagent\u201d products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a \u201chigh-income knowledge worker\u201d agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting \u201cPhD-level research,\u201d are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It\u2019s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\nChatGPT can directly edit your code\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\nChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI\u2019s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT\u2019s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model\u2019s launch.\nFebruary 2025\nOpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a \u2018unified\u2019 next-gen release\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \u201csimplified\u201d product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \u201cintegrates a lot of [OpenAI\u2019s] technology,\u201d including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI\u2019s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn\u2019t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model\u2019s thought process\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step \u201cthought\u201d process. ChatGPT users will see an updated \u201cchain of thought\u201d that shows more of the model\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot\u2019s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for \u2018deep research\u2019\nOpenAI announced a new AI \u201cagent\u201d called deep research that\u2019s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the \u201cagent\u201d is intended for instances where you don\u2019t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\nJanuary 2025\nOpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user\u2019s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models\u2019 responses to human replies for that same post.\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest \u2018reasoning\u2019 model\nOpenAI launched a new AI \u201creasoning\u201d model, o3-mini, the newest in the company\u2019s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both \u201cpowerful\u201d and \u201caffordable.\u201d\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are 85% male, report says\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI\u2019s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI\u2019s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech\u2019s faults\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\nOperator, OpenAI\u2019s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT\u2019s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren\u2019t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT\u2019s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI\u2019s website.\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number \u2014 no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can\u2019t upgrade to one of OpenAI\u2019s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn\u2019t supported without a valid email.\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\nChatGPT\u2019s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like \u2018chatty\u2019 and \u2018Gen Z\u2019\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \u201ctraits\u201d they\u2019d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \u201cChatty,\u201d \u201cEncouraging,\u201d and \u201cGen Z.\u201d However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it\u2019s possible they went live prematurely.\nFAQs:\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\nWho uses ChatGPT?\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\nYes.\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n\ntitle2:\nDeel files countersuit against Rippling as rivalry escalates\ndescription2:\nIn the latest development of an increasingly public dispute between HR and payroll services rivals, Deel has filed a countersuit against Rippling.\nTo recap: Rippling publicly announced on March 17 that it was suing Deel over alleged corporate espionage, with accusations ranging from violation of the RICO racketeering act (typically used to prosecute organized crime) to misappropriation of trade secrets and unfair competition. Deel is now slamming that lawsuit as part of a \u201ccampaign to try to impugn Deel\u2019s reputation.\u201d\nThat original lawsuit included an affidavit from the alleged spy that reads like a movie script. Deel had previously denied all wrongdoing.\nNow the startup is taking things a step further. In a blog post Friday, Deel announced it has filed a civil suit against Rippling in the Superior Court in Delaware.\nDeel\u2019s complaint, dated April 24 and reviewed by TechCrunch, paints an unflattering picture of Rippling CEO Parker Conrad, describing the executive as \u201chaunted by his previous failures, and now fueled by suffocating jealousy at his inability to fairly compete with Deel in the marketplace.\u201d\nDeel also alleged that Rippling was not remitting its customers\u2019 payroll tax and social benefits dollars to local taxation authorities, but rather \u201ccategorizing and reporting these funds as its own earnings.\u201d It went on to claim that \u201cnot only does Rippling steal these funds from its clients, but also from its own employees by using a similar scheme.\u201d\nIn response, Conrad took to X to post that, \u201cNowhere does Deel dispute our central allegation \u2013 that @Bouazizalex personally recruited a spy to steal rippling\u2019s trade secrets, and personally directed the theft.\u201d\nSpecifically, Deel filed three motions addressing Rippling\u2019s March lawsuit, including:\nA motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds in favor of Ireland \u2014 arguing the case should be resolved where \u201cRippling previously initiated litigation\u201d against Keith O\u2019Brien, the alleged spy, and has now named Deel and several executives, including CEO and co-founder Alex Bouaziz.\nA motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) \u2014 citing \u201cRippling\u2019s failure to state a viable claim against Deel.\u201d\nAn anti-SLAPP motion \u2014 \u201dto stem Rippling\u2019s attempt, through litigation, to infringe on Deel\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d\nIn its complaint, Deel makes counter-accusations, alleging that Rippling solicited Deel employees \u201cto pass on to Rippling confidential commercially sensitive information about Deel.\u201d The filing further accuses Rippling of placing its own \u201cinsider at Deel, essentially allowing it to eavesdrop on Deel\u2019s internal communications without Deel\u2019s permission.\u201d\nAs of April 14, Rippling was attempting to serve Alex Bouaziz with legal papers. However, French bailiffs hired by Rippling couldn\u2019t seem to find Bouaziz. On April 15, TechCrunch reported that Deel\u2019s CEO was in Dubai, further complicating Ripple\u2019s efforts to serve him. A Deel spokesperson told TechCrunch on Friday: \u201cAlex lives in Israel. He was in Dubai for a few days for Passover with his family, something he\u2019s done for the past several years.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nStartups Weekly: Tech IPOs and deals proceed, but price matters\ndescription3:\nWelcome to Startups Weekly \u2014 your weekly recap of everything you can\u2019t miss from the world of startups.

Plus, there\u2019s still money to be deployed into emerging markets.\nVibe coding: Supabase, an open source database startup that benefits from the hype around vibe coding tools, raised a $200 million Series D just seven months after its C round at a reported $900 million valuation, which now officially increased to $2 billion.\nAdaptive Computer, a vibe coding startup that differentiates itself by focusing on non-programmers from day 1, also raised funding: a $7 million seed round led by Pebblebed.\nToo many chats: Manychat, which provides an AI-enabled tool for businesses to manage and automate conversations across multiple messaging channels, raised a $140 million Series B led by Summit Partners.\nSpotting flaws: Endor Labs, a startup that builds tools to scan AI-generated code for vulnerabilities, locked a $93 million Series B round led by DFJ Growth.\nSovereign AI: Formerly known as Xayn, Berlin-based legal AI startup Noxtua raised a $92.2 million Series B that follows its pivot into developing sovereign AI for law-related use cases such as drafting legal documents.\nShear money: Fintech API brokerage startup Alpaca picked up a $52 million Series C to further expand internationally.\nVirtual CISO: Cynomi, a London- and Tel Aviv-based startup that provides SMBs with an AI-powered \u201cvirtual CISO,\u201d raised a $37 million Series B co-led by Insight Partners and Entr\u00e9e Capital.\nSuperpowers: After gathering a 150,000-person waitlist, health tech startup Superpower launched publicly and announced it raised a $30 million Series A backed by several celebrities.\nDebt financing: Froda, a Swedish fintech startup that developed a debt financing platform for SMBs, secured a $22.7 million Series B led by Swedish fund Incore Invest.\nCheat code: Chungin \u201cRoy\u201d Lee, a 21-year-old Columbia student who was suspended after developing a job interview cheating tool, raised $5.3 million in seed funding for his startup, Cluely, which offers an AI tool to \u201ccheat on everything.\u201d\nCopy-paste: Backed by more than 75 unicorn founders and VCs, Fluent Ventures is distributing $40 million to international founders, replicating proven business models in emerging markets.\nLast but not least\nTechstars accelerator new fund raising $150 million Image Credits:Techstars (opens in a new window)\nIn case you missed it, Techstars recently updated its standard deal: It will now invest $220,000 into startups entering its three-month program. That\u2019s $100,000 more than previously, with new deal terms that mirror Y Combinator\u2019s.\n\ntitle4:\nChinese AI startup Manus reportedly gets funding from Benchmark at $500M valuation\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nChinese startup Manus AI, which works on building tools related to AI agents, has picked up $75 million in a funding round led by Benchmark at a roughly $500 million valuation, according to Bloomberg.\nThe company will use the money to expand to new markets, including the U.S., Japan, and the Middle East, Bloomberg noted, citing people familiar with the matter.\nBloomberg\u2019s report suggests that the fresh round has quintupled the valuation of Manus, which previously raised somewhere north of $10 million from backers including Tencent and HSG (formerly Sequoia China).\nManus came into the spotlight in March when the company launched a demo of a general AI agent that could complete various tasks. (In TechCrunch\u2019s testing, it didn\u2019t work quite as well as advertised.) The company later launched paid subscription plans costing between $39 per month and $199 per month.\"\n\nResponse:",
