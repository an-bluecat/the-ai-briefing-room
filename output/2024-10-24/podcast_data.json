Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Instead, OpenAI is planning to grant access first to companies it works closely with in order for them to build their own products and features, according to a source familiar with the plan.\nAnother source tells The Verge that engineers inside Microsoft \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s main partner for deploying AI models \u2014 are preparing to host Orion on Azure as early as November. While Orion is seen inside OpenAI as the successor to GPT-4, it\u2019s unclear if the company will call it GPT-5 externally. As always, the release plan is subject to change and could slip. OpenAI and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.\nDo you work at OpenAI? I\u2019d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com.\nOrion has been teased by an OpenAI executive as potentially up to 100 times more powerful than GPT-4; it\u2019s separate from the o1 reasoning model OpenAI released in September. The company\u2019s goal is to combine its LLMs over time to create an even more capable model that could eventually be called artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\nIt was previously reported that OpenAI was using o1, code named Strawberry, to provide synthetic data to train Orion. In September, OpenAI researchers threw a happy hour to celebrate finishing training the new model, a source familiar with the matter tells The Verge.\nThat timing lines up with a cryptic post on X by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, in which he said he was \u201cexcited for the winter constellations to rise soon.\u201d If you ask ChatGPT o1-preview what Altman\u2019s post is hiding, it will tell you that he\u2019s hinting at the word Orion, which is the winter constellation that\u2019s most visible in the night sky from November to February (but it also hallucinates that you can rearrange the letters to spell \u201cORION\u201d).\nEven ChatGPT thinks Sam Altman is teasing Orion. Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge\n\ntitle1:\nTesla stock surges as analysts react to Q3 earnings, Musk predictions\ndescription1:\nElon Musk attends 'Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk' session during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three on June 19, 2024 in Cannes, France.\nTesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock's best day since 2013, following the company's better-than-expected earnings report.\nThe company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts' expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\n\"We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,\" analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\nTesla's profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a \"potentially unsustainable driver\" of earnings and cash flow.\nAutomakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can't meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.\nTesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company's Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called \"Actually Smart Summon.\"\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that his \"best guess\" is that \"vehicle growth\" will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing \"lower cost vehicles\" and the \"advent of autonomy.\" Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\nEven bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk's forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, \"Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),\" and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk's 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a \"maybe.\" They set their estimate at 14%.\nIt \"clearly depends on the company's ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,\" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.\nA grain of salt\nMusk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\nBernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: \"The tone of Tesla's conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.\"\nMusk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn't happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete.\nThe Bernstein analysts wrote, \"We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.\"\nThey pointed to Musk's \"long history of being overly optimistic about FSD\" and said crowdsourced research that shows \"Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors\" on robotaxis.\nThe share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla's loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.\n\ntitle2:\nUnitedHealth says Change Healthcare hack affects over 100 million, the largest-ever US healthcare data breach\ndescription2:\nMore than 100 million individuals had their private health information stolen during the ransomware attack on Change Healthcare in February, a cyberattack that caused months of unprecedented outages and widespread disruption across the U.S. healthcare sector.\nThis is the first time that UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the U.S. health insurance provider that owns the health tech company, has put a number of affected individuals to the data breach, after previously saying it anticipated the breach to include data on a \u201csubstantial proportion of people in America.\u201d\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services first reported the updated number on its data breach portal on Thursday.\nUHG spokesperson Tyler Mason said in a brief statement: \u201cWe continue to notify potentially impacted individuals as quickly as possible, on a rolling basis, given the volume and complexity of the data involved and the investigation is still in its final stages.\u201d\nThe ransomware attack and data breach at Change Healthcare stands as the largest known digital theft of U.S. medical records, and one of the biggest data breaches in living history. The ramifications for the millions of Americans whose private medical information was irretrievably stolen are likely to be life lasting.\nUHG began notifying affected individuals in late July, which continued through October.\nThe stolen data varies by individual, but Change previously confirmed that it includes personal information, such as names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, and government identity documents, including Social Security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, and passport numbers. The stolen health data includes diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging and care and treatment plans, and health insurance information \u2014 as well as financial and banking information found in claims and payment data taken by the criminals.\nChange Healthcare is one of the largest handlers of health, medical data, and patient records, as it processes patient insurance and billing across the U.S. healthcare sector, including thousands of hospitals, pharmacies, and medical practices. As such, Change handles huge amounts of health and medical-related information on around a third of all Americans, the company\u2019s chief executive Andrew Witty told lawmakers in May.\nThe cyberattack became public on February 21 when Change Healthcare pulled much of its network offline to contain the intruders, causing immediate outages across the U.S. healthcare sector that relied on Change for handling patient insurance and billing.\nUHG attributed the cyberattack to ALPHV/BlackCat, a Russian-speaking ransomware and extortion gang, which later took credit for the cyberattack.\nThe ransomware gang\u2019s leaders later vanished after absconding with a $22 million ransom paid by the health insurance giant, stiffing the group\u2019s contractors who carried out the hacking of Change Healthcare out of their new financial windfall. The contractors took the data they stole from Change Healthcare and formed a new group, which extorted a second ransom from UHG, while publishing a portion of the stolen files online in the process to prove their threat.\nThere is no evidence that the cybercriminals subsequently deleted the data. Other extortion gangs, including LockBit, have been shown to hoard stolen data, even after the victim pays and the criminals claim to have deleted the data.\nIn paying the ransom, Change obtained a copy of the stolen dataset, allowing the company to identify and notify the affected individuals whose information was found in the data.\nEfforts by the U.S. government to catch the hackers behind ALPHV/BlackCat, one of the most prolific ransomware gangs today, have so far failed. The gang bounced back following a takedown operation in 2023 to seize the gang\u2019s dark web leak site.\nMonths after the Change Healthcare breach, the U.S. State Department upped its reward for information on the whereabouts of the ALPHV/BlackCat cybercriminals to $10 million.\nCorporate consolidation and poor security blamed for data breach\nPortions of Change Healthcare\u2019s network remain offline as the company continues to recover from the February cyberattack. Lawmakers are also investigating the breach and the effect on the millions of Americans whose health data was irreversibly stolen.\nDuring a House hearing into the cyberattack in April, UnitedHealth\u2019s CEO Witty confirmed that the cybercriminals broke into one of its employee systems using stolen credentials that were not protected with multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security feature that can help to protect against the misuse of password theft.\nBy gaining access to a critical internal system using only a stolen password, the ransomware gang was able to reach other parts of Change Healthcare\u2019s network and deploy ransomware.\nUnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty testifies before the Senate Finance committee on Capitol Hill on May 1, 2024, in Washington, DC. Image Credits:Kent Nishimura / Getty Images\nIt\u2019s unclear why the system was not protected with MFA, but this will likely remain a key part of the ongoing investigations by lawmakers and the government. Witty told lawmakers that the organization has since rolled out and now enforces MFA following the cyberattack.\nLawmakers homed in on how UHG handles so much data and generates so much revenue and failed at basic cybersecurity.\nAccording to its 2023 full-year earnings report, UHG made $22 billion in profit on revenues of $371 billion. Witty made $23.5 million in executive compensation the same year.\nWhile the lack of MFA was abused in this case, the sheer size and wealth of highly sensitive data that Change Healthcare collects and stores made it a target in itself, lawmakers said.\nChange Healthcare merged with U.S. healthcare provider Optum in 2022 as part of a $7.8 billion deal by UnitedHealth Group. The deal brought the two healthcare giants under UHG and allowed Optum, which owns physician groups and provides tech and data to insurance companies and healthcare services, broad access to patient records handled by Change.\nUnitedHealth Group collectively provides over 53 million U.S. customers with benefit plans and another 5 million outside of the United States, according to its latest full-year earnings report. Optum serves about 103 million U.S. customers.\nThe deal faced scrutiny by U.S. federal antitrust authorities, who sued to block UHG from buying Change Healthcare and merging it with Optum, arguing that UnitedHealth would get an unfair competitive advantage by gaining access to \u201cabout half of all Americans\u2019 health insurance claims pass each year.\u201d A judge ultimately approved the deal.\nThe Justice Department reportedly began cranking up its investigation into UHG and its potential anticompetitive practices in the months prior to the Change Healthcare hack.\nUpdated with UHG comment.\nRead more:\n\ntitle3:\nNvidia supplier SK Hynix posts record quarterly profit as AI boom drives demand\ndescription3:\nSK Hynix logo displayed on a phone screen as seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on January 30, 2023.\nSouth Korea's SK Hynix , one of the world's largest memory chipmakers, on Thursday posted record quarterly profit, boosted by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in generative AI.\nHere are SK Hynix's third-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:\nRevenue: 17.57 trillion won ($12.7 billion) vs. 18.11 trillion won\n17.57 trillion won ($12.7 billion) vs. 18.11 trillion won Operating profit: 7.03 trillion won ($5.08 billion) vs. 6.8 trillion won\nOperating profit in the July-September quarter hit its highest level, rebounding from a loss of 1.8 trillion won during the same period last year.\nQuarterly revenue grew about 94% year-on-year from 9.1 trillion won.\nThe South Korean chip giant is a key supplier to Nvidia and has benefitted from a boom in artificial intelligence servers.\nSK Hynix said in its earnings release Thursday that demand for AI memory, particularly from data center customers, continued to be strong in the third quarter, allowing it to expand sales of premium products such as HBM.\nHBM is a type of dynamic random access memory, known as DRAM, in which chips are vertically stacked to save space and reduce power consumption. DRAM is often used in laptops, workstations and PCs. SK Hynix, Micron Technology and Samsung Electronics are the three main manufacturers of HBM chips.\nSales of HBM products were also up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than three times from the same period last year, with the company expecting continued growth.\n\ntitle4:\nWhy Meta and Snap are spending billions on AR glasses\ndescription4:\nAfter a decade of development and billions of dollars, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in September pulled back the curtain on one of the company's most ambitious projects: an augmented reality prototype called Orion. A week earlier, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel took the stage at its annual Snap Partner Summit to introduce its AR capable, 5th-generation Spectacles. Both companies see massive potential for the technology, with a grand vision for AR glasses to usurp smartphones as the next generation of computing.\n\"This is a major leap forward for technology,\" Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer, told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in an exclusive interview. \"It's a big step forward for our sort of goal to help define the next generation of computing.\"\nThe dream of augmented and mixed reality is something tech giants have been pursuing for years.\nEarlier this year, Apple started selling its Vision Pro virtual reality headset for $3,500. Over a decade ago, Google was first to market in 2013 with Google Glass, an early attempt at an AR device, but the product faced challenges and was ultimately canceled. Microsoft has also invested in AR technology for well over a decade, launching its HoloLens headset for enterprise in 2016. Failing to gain traction, the HoloLens was discontinued in October.\n\"We're in our adolescence,\" said Tuong Nguyen, Gartner director analyst. \"We see a lot of potential, but we haven't quite reached that potential yet.\"\nWhile Snap and Meta have debuted AR prototypes, they're still years away from selling those devices to consumers. The technology is too costly to mass produce. For now, Meta plans to use Orion as a developer device for its employees.\n\"We're going to use it mostly internally to build out the software we need to,\" Zuckerberg said at the Meta Connect conference in September. \"We're also going to work with a handful of partners externally to make sure we get a diversity of content.\"\nSnap similarly plans to invest in building out its ecosystem, renting its AR glasses to developers who commit to paying $99 a month for a year for the Spectacles.\n\"We've really tried to lower the barrier to folks getting started with this new technology,\" Spiegel told Boorstin. \"We're at a unique moment where both consumers and developers are really ready for something new.\"\nWatch the video as CNBC's Julia Boorstin tries Meta and Snap's augmented reality glasses and explores the future of this cutting-edge tech.\"\n\nResponse:",
