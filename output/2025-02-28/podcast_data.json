Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday March 3), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nSergey Brin says RTO is key to Google winning the AGI race\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nGoogle co-founder Sergey Brin sent a memo to employees this week urging them to return to the office \u201cat least every weekday\u201d in order to help the company win the AGI race, The New York Times reports. Brin told employees that working 60 hours a week is a \u201csweet spot\u201d for productivity.\nWhile Brin\u2019s memo is not an official policy change for Google, which requires workers to come to work in person three days a week, it does show the pressure Silicon Valley giants are feeling to compete in AI. The memo also indicates that Brin believes Google could build AGI, a superintelligent AI system on par with human intelligence.\nBrin has reportedly returned to Google in recent years to help the company regain its footing in the AI race. Google was caught by surprise by OpenAI\u2019s 2022 release of ChatGPT, but has worked diligently to catch up with industry leading AI models of its own.\n\ntitle1:\nIntel delays its Ohio chip factory to 2030\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nIntel\u2019s first chip fabrication plant in Ohio may not open until 2030 at the earliest.\nAccording to a report in The Columbus Dispatch, Intel has slowed the building of its promised $28 billion semiconductor project in central Ohio for the second time this year. Construction won\u2019t be completed until 2030, the chipmaker told the publication, and the factory might not actually open until 2031.\nThe factory, one of two Intel plans to build in Ohio, was originally scheduled to begin operating this year. Intel told The Columbus Dispatch that it remains committed to the project and has already invested $3.7 billion locally.\nIntel\u2019s financial woes are reportedly a big reason for the chip facility\u2019s delayed opening. According to The Columbus Dispatch, Intel EVP Naga Chandrasekaran told employees in a message on Friday that the delayed timeline will allow Intel to better \u201cmanage [its] capital responsibly\u201d and align its factory operation with market demand.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Intel for more information and will update this post if we hear back.\n\ntitle2:\nMicrosoft hangs up on Skype: Service to shut down May 5, 2025\ndescription2:\nAfter kickstarting the market for making calls over the internet 23 years ago, Skype is closing down. Microsoft, which acquired the messaging and calling app 14 years ago, said it will be retiring it from active duty on May 5 to double down on Teams. Skype users have 10 weeks to decide what they want to do with their account.\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people are impacted. The most recent numbers that Microsoft had shared were in 2023, when it said it had more than 36 million users \u2014 a long way from Skype\u2019s peak of 300 million users.\n\u201cWe know this is a big deal for our Skype users, and we\u2019re very grateful for their support of Skype and all the learnings that have factored into Teams over the last seven years,\u201d Jeff Teper, president of Microsoft 365 collaborative Apps and platforms, told TechCrunch in an interview this week. \u201cAt this point, putting all our focus behind Teams will let us give a simpler message and drive faster innovation.\u201d\nBetween now and May 5, users will have the option to migrate all their contacts and chat data over to Microsoft\u2019s Teams platform. Alternatively, users can download their Skype data using the app\u2019s built-in export tool.\nThe business case\nThe news will come as little surprise to those who have followed Skype in recent years, and in many ways, the writing has been on the wall since 2016, when Microsoft debuted Teams.\nWhile Microsoft had launched a specific Skype for Business product in 2015, Teams\u2019 arrival signaled a new direction for Microsoft in the cloud communications space. Many likened Teams to a Slack clone, but the bigger ambition was to build a platform that would give space for collaboration and communication across a wide range of Microsoft and other apps, and that included video and text chatting \u2014 a direct overlap with Skype.\nMicrosoft then revealed plans to phase out Skype for Business in 2017, concluding those efforts four years later, in 2021. That same year, Microsoft selected Teams as the integrated communications app of choice on Windows 11, relegating Skype to the sidelines.\nFast-forward to December 2024, TechCrunch reported that Microsoft had stopped letting Skype users add credit to their accounts, or buy Skype phone numbers, pushing users to monthly subscriptions and Skype-to-phone plans instead.\nAnd so this takes us to today\u2019s news, signalling the end of a brand and company that was one of the first big tech startups to launch out of Europe in the dawdling days of dial-up.\nSkype\u2019s death knell comes two years after Microsoft started rolling out an entirely rebuilt, rearchitected Teams desktop and web app. In those two years, Teper says consumer calling minutes in Teams has grown fourfold, though he declined to say how many consumers make up its 320 million user base.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at a high enough scale that we feel great about the app [Teams] for personal use,\u201d Teper said. \u201cWe feel we have the mileage under our belt on the adoption by consumers, [who are] using Teams in their personal lives. We\u2019ve thought about [shutting down Skype] for a while, but we really felt like the product had to show the end-user adoption with consumers telling us it was ready.\u201d\nAnd Microsoft believes that consumers are now ready.\nUser numbers\nWhile Skype ushered in a new era of internet-based communication, starting with voice before expanding to video and file-sharing, the arrival of smartphones and a swathe of new messaging apps have taken a toll on Skype\u2019s user count through the years. For context, WhatsApp sailed past 2 billion users in 2020.\nWhen Skype filed for an IPO in 2010, it revealed 560 million registered users and 124 million monthly active users. But rather than going public in the wake of its spinoff from eBay (which it had acquired it in 2005), Microsoft tabled a $8.5 billion bid for Skype in 2011 and grew the platform to a peak of 300 million users in 2013.\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t made a habit of breaking out Skype user numbers in subsequent years, though it has teased the occasional data point. At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the company revealed that Skype had grown 70% month-on-month to 40 million daily users, as people sought ways to stay in touch with loved ones during lockdown \u2014 a trend that generated similar surges in rival platforms such as Zoom.\nThe most recent update Microsoft provided was via a blog post published in early 2023 announcing an integration between Skype and its Bing search engine, where it revealed that \u201cmore than 36 million people use Skype daily to connect through phone calls and chats\u201d globally.\nThe long and short of this, though, is that Teams\u2019 growth and Skype\u2019s flatlining is one reason Microsoft reckons now is a good time to go all in on Teams.\n\u201cSkype took a bump \u2014 as did Teams \u2014 during the pandemic, and Skype has largely been pretty stable in the last couple of years,\u201d Teper said. \u201cAnd we felt the time, and the feedback, was such that we could make the move.\u201d\nPhone home\nMicrosoft is encouraging users to move over to Teams Free. This offers some additional features not available in Skype, such as calendar integrations, but Teams Free lacks other key features that were hallmarks of Skype \u2014 specifically, phone-call functionality that allowed users to call mobile and landline numbers, as well as receive phone calls with a Skype phone number.\nMicrosoft began deprecating these services back in December, preventing users from adding any further credit to their accounts while also putting a halt on buying Skype numbers. Users were still able to make calls to phone numbers with a valid monthly subscription or any remaining credit they had, but the subscription renewals will come to an end on April 3.\nFor legacy users who still have credit in their accounts, Microsoft will be making a Skype Dial Pad available both in the Skype web portal and in Teams for an indefinite period.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll support [this] as long as users have credit and they\u2019re using this functionality,\u201d Microsoft VP of product Amit Fulay told TechCrunch.\nDespite the enterprise incarnation of Teams offering phone-calling functionality, Fulay confirmed that Teams Free won\u2019t support PSTN (public switched telephone network) services, mostly because of shifting consumer trends.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at usage of telephony for a while on Skype, and patterns have changed, usage has changed, and this is a step towards that,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have mobile data plans, and when this [telephony] functionality came out many years ago, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\nSystem migration\nDuring the transition period, Skype users will be able to download the Teams app and log in with their Skype credentials, with all their chats and contacts migrating over automatically. The Skype app will continue to work in tandem, through May 5, 2025.\nSkype to Teams migration. Image Credits:Microsoft\nAlternatively, users will be able to export their data, though in reality there likely isn\u2019t all that much they\u2019ll be able to do with it in terms of importing it anywhere else.\n\u201cWe wanted to make sure that during this transition, people aren\u2019t losing their contacts, their memories,\u201d Fulay said. \u201cWe want to make sure we preserve all the things people have shared. And if they choose to come to Teams, we\u2019ll restore all of their contacts and data.\u201d\nIf a user takes no action by May 5, Skype says it will retain user data until the end of the year, after which it will be deleted.\nBlurred lines\nOne of the big takeaways from all this is how the lines between the business and consumer realms have blurred, due in part to societal norms around technology and trends such as remote work.\nSkype began as a consumer product that spread into the business sphere, while Teams began as a business product that segued into consumer. Teams today, though, still feels like a business product, particularly due to its name. Do families and friends really see themselves as part of one big \u201cteam\u201d?\nTeper, for his part, doesn\u2019t see this as a problem, given that many of its existing products already transcend use-case boundaries.\n\u201cI think a lot of people will make the transition [from Skype to Teams],\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think about Word, Excel, PowerPoint, those are brands that work for business and personal use for people. We have kids and parents doing their homework in Word, and budgets in Excel, so we have good precedent about our tools being used in personal and work life.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle Sheets gets a Gemini-powered upgrade to analyze data faster and create visuals\ndescription4:\nGoogle is giving Sheets a Gemini-powered upgrade that is designed to help users analyze data faster and turn spreadsheets into charts using AI.\nWith this update, users can access Gemini\u2019s capabilities to generate insights from their data, such as correlations, trends, outliers, and more. Users now can also generate advanced visualizations, like heatmaps, that they can insert as static images over cells in spreadsheets.\nWhile the company announced the update last month, Google said on Friday that it\u2019s now available to all Workspace business users.\nTo get started, you need to click the Gemini icon on the top right-hand side of your spreadsheet. From there, you can ask things like \u201cpredict my net income for the next quarter based on historical data\u201d or \u201ccreate a simple heatmap of support cases by category and device.\u201d\nImage Credits:Google\nOther examples include a marketing manager asking Gemini to \u201cProvide some insights on my top 3 performing channels by conversion rate\u201d or a financial analyst asking Gemini to \u201cIdentify any anomalies in inventory levels for Product X.\u201d\nGemini is able to do all this by creating and running Python code and then analyzing the results to perform multi-layered analysis, Google says. For simpler requests, Gemini might still provide answers using formulas instead of Python code.\nThe company notes that data should be in a consistent format with clear headers and no missing values to allow for accurate results.\"\n\nResponse:",
