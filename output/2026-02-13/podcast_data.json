    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Monday February 16), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nMeta plans to add facial recognition to its smart glasses, report claims\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nMeta plans to add facial recognition to its smart glasses as soon as this year, according to a new report from The New York Times. The feature, internally known as \u201cName Tag,\u201d would allow smart glasses wearers to identify people and get information about them through Meta\u2019s AI assistant.\nMeta\u2019s plans could change, the report notes. The tech giant has been deliberating since early last year on how to release a feature that carries \u201csafety and privacy risks.\u201d\nAccording to an internal memo, the company had originally planned to release Name Tag to attendees of a conference for the visually impaired before releasing it to the public, but didn\u2019t end up doing that.\nMeta reportedly saw the political tumult in the United States as a good time to release the feature.\n\u201cWe will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,\u201d the document reads.\nMeta considered adding facial recognition technology to the first version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses back in 2021, but dropped the plans over technical challenges and ethical concerns. The NYT reports that the company has revived its plans as the Trump administration has grown closer to Big Tech, and following the unexpected success of its smart glasses.\n\ntitle1:\nAirbnb says a third of its customer support is now handled by AI in the US and Canada\ndescription1:\nAirbnb says its custom-built AI agent is now handling roughly a third of its customer support issues in North America, and it\u2019s preparing to roll out the feature globally. If successful, the company believes that in a year\u2019s time, more than 30% of its total customer support tickets will be handled by AI voice and chat in all the languages where it also employs a human customer service agent.\n\u201cWe think this is going to be massive because not only does this reduce the cost base of Airbnb customer service, but the quality of service is going to be a huge step change,\u201d CEO Brian Chesky said during the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call this week. This seems to suggest he believes the AI would do a better job than its human counterparts in resolving some issues.\nThe company also touted its recent hire of CTO Ahmad Al-Dahle, poached from Meta for his AI expertise, and its plans to create an AI-native experience.\nWith his guidance, Chesky said that Airbnb was poised to introduce an app that doesn\u2019t just search for you, but one that \u201cknows you.\u201d\n\u201cIt will help guests plan their entire trip, help hosts better run their businesses, and help the company operate more efficiently at scale,\u201d Chesky explained, adding that\u2019s why Airbnb brought Al-Dahle on board.\n\u201cAhmad is one of the world\u2019s leading AI experts. He spent 16 years at Apple, and most recently led the generative AI team at Meta that built the Llama models. He\u2019s an expert at pairing massive technical scale with world-class design, which is exactly how we\u2019re going to transform the Airbnb experience,\u201d Chesky noted.\nLike other businesses poised for disruption by AI, Airbnb\u2019s leadership is pushing the idea that it has a unique database and product that other AI chatbots can\u2019t replicate.\n\u201cA chatbot doesn\u2019t have our 200 million verified identities or our 500 million proprietary reviews, and it can\u2019t message the hosts, which 90% of our guests do,\u201d Chesky told analysts during the earnings call. Instead, he pitched the idea of layering AI over the Airbnb experience, which he claimed would help to accelerate growth.\nThe company forecast revenue growth would be in the \u201clow double digits\u201d this year, after pulling in $2.78 billion in the fourth quarter, above estimates of $2.72 billion. This quarter, it expects revenue of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion, above Wall Street forecasts of $2.53 billion.\nInvestors still wanted to know if AI platforms could be a risk in the long-term, assuming they moved into the short-term rentals market. Chesky, however, pushed back at that idea, saying that Airbnb isn\u2019t just the consumer-facing app; it\u2019s also the host app, the customer service, and the protections it offers, like insurance and user verifications.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built this over 18 years. We handle more than $100 billion in payments through the platform,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, AI chatbots serve a function similar to search, in that they deliver top-of-funnel traffic, he noted. That traffic also converts at a higher rate than traffic from Google, Chesky pointed out, suggesting that the shift to AI would benefit Airbnb.\nThe company is already using AI to power its search, with the feature now enabled for a \u201cvery small percentage\u201d of Airbnb\u2019s traffic, while it experiments with making its search more conversational. Later, the company plans to integrate sponsored listings within search.\nWhile Spotify this week told investors its best developers hadn\u2019t written a single line of code since December, thanks to AI, Airbnb offered a more high-level metric on its own internal AI adoption. The company said that 80% of its engineers now use AI tools, and it\u2019s working to get that to 100% soon.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI removes access to sycophancy-prone GPT-4o model\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nStarting Friday, OpenAI will cease providing access to five legacy ChatGPT models, including the popular but controversial GPT-4o model.\nThe 4o model has been at the center of a number of lawsuits concerning user self-harm, delusional behavior, and AI psychosis. It remains OpenAI\u2019s highest scoring model for sycophancy.\nIn addition to GPT-4o, the GPT-5, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and OpenAI o4-mini models have also been deprecated.\nOpenAI intended to retire GPT-4o in August, when it unveiled the GPT-5 model. But at the time, there was enough backlash for OpenAI to keep the legacy model available for paid subscribers, who could manually choose to interact with that model. In a recent blog post, OpenAI noted that only 0.1% of customers have been using GPT-4o, but for a company with 800 million weekly active users, that small percentage still amounts to 800,000 people.\nThousands of users have rallied against the retirement of 4o, citing their close relationships with the model.\n\ntitle3:\nFintech lending giant Figure confirms data breach\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nFigure Technology, a blockchain-based lending company, confirmed it experienced a data breach.\nOn Friday, Figure spokesperson Alethea Jadick told TechCrunch in a statement that the breach originated when an employee was tricked with a social engineering attack that allowed the hackers to steal \u201ca limited number of files.\u201d\nThe statement said the company is communicating \u201cwith partners and those impacted,\u201d and offering free credit monitoring \u201cto all individuals who receive a notice.\u201d\nFigure\u2019s spokesperson did not respond to a series of specific questions about the breach.\nThe hacking group ShinyHunters took responsibility for the hack on its official dark web leak website, saying the company refused to pay a ransom, and published 2.5 gigabytes of allegedly stolen data.\nTechCrunch saw a portion of the data, which included customers\u2019 full names, home addresses, dates of birth, and phone numbers.\nA member of ShinyHunters told TechCrunch that Figure was among the victims of a hacking campaign that targeted customers who rely on the single sign-on provider Okta. Other victims of the campaign include Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn).\n\ntitle4:\nRoku to launch streaming bundles as part of its efforts to continue growing its profitability\ndescription4:\nRoku shared its fourth-quarter earnings for 2025 this week, as well as some exciting plans in the pipeline. The company is rolling out new streaming bundles, expanding its $3 subscription service, Howdy, to more platforms, and partnering with more premium streaming services following the successful addition of HBO Max.\nLaunching bundles in 2026 is a smart move, as it could attract more viewers looking for enticing deals amid rising subscription prices. Many streaming platforms have been increasing their rates recently, and Roku aims to appeal to cost-conscious consumers. The positive impact of HBO Max on Roku\u2019s premium subscriptions has encouraged the company to continue this strategy by adding more top-tier partners, which is likely to drive growth going forward.\nAdditionally, Roku launched its ad-free subscription streaming service, Howdy, last year and plans to expand its availability beyond the Roku platform. While specific details remain undisclosed, Roku CEO Anthony Wood stated at CES last month that the goal is to distribute Howdy widely, saying, \u201cWe want to distribute it everywhere.\u201d\nOther highlights include Roku users streaming 145.6 billion hours of video in 2025, marking a 15% increase from 2024. The company is also nearing the milestone of 100 million streaming households, though it has decided to report this figure less frequently.\nFinancially, Roku delivered an impressive quarter, posting net income of $80.5 million, a rebound from a $35.5 million loss in the same period last year. Total revenue for Q4 2025 reached $1.4 billion, representing a 16% year-over-year increase.\nLooking ahead, Roku is optimistic, projecting total net revenue of $5.5 billion and gross profit of $2.4 billion.\n\u201cIn 2023, our priority was to rightsize our cost structure and reach adjusted EBITDA breakeven in 2024, and we achieved that goal a full year ahead of schedule,\u201d Wood told investors during the call yesterday afternoon. \u201cLooking ahead to 2026 and beyond, we are confident in our ability to sustain double-digit platform revenue growth while continuing to grow profitability.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
