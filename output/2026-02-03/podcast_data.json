Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday February 4), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nIntel will start making GPUs, a market dominated by Nvidia\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nAs Intel continues to try to turn itself around, its CEO promised that the company will start producing a new type of chip, one that has been made very popular by rival Nvidia.\nAt the Cisco AI Summit on Tuesday, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced that the company will start producing graphics processing units (GPUs). These are more specialized processors, compared to the CPUs Intel traditionally produces, and are used for gaming and tasks like training artificial intelligence models.\nTechCrunch reached out to Intel for more information.\nThe project will be overseen by Kevork Kechichian, the executive vice president and general manager of Intel\u2019s data center group, according to reporting from Reuters. Kechichian was hired in September among a slew of new engineer-focused hires.\nIntel also hired Eric Demers for the effort in January. Demers was previously at Qualcomm for more than 13 years, most recently serving as a senior vice president of engineering.\nThis initiative seems to be in relatively early stages as Tan said the company plans to develop its strategy around customer demands and needs.\nWhile Nvidia didn\u2019t invent the GPU, that specific kind of chip has played a large role in its success. Its GPUs for AI systems are so advanced and popular, the chipmaker currently holds a commanding market lead.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nIt\u2019s interesting to see Intel expand into this area now as Tan said the company would be consolidating and focusing on its core businesses when he took the helm as CEO last March. While GPUs are still semiconductors, of course, this is still a notable expansion.\n\ntitle1:\nXcode moves into agentic coding with deeper OpenAI and Anthropic integrations\ndescription1:\nApple is bringing agentic coding to Xcode. On Tuesday, the company announced the release of Xcode 26.3, which will allow developers to use agentic tools, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude Agent and OpenAI\u2019s Codex, directly in Apple\u2019s official app development suite.\nThe Xcode 26.3 Release Candidate is available to all Apple Developers today from the developer website and will hit the App Store a bit later.\nThis latest update comes on the heels of the Xcode 26 release last year, which introduced support for ChatGPT and Claude within Apple\u2019s integrated development environment (IDE) used by those building apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple\u2019s other hardware platforms.\nThe integration of agentic coding tools allows AI models to tap into more of Xcode\u2019s features to perform their tasks and perform more complex automation.\nThe models will also have access to Apple\u2019s current developer documentation to ensure they use the latest APIs and follow the best practices as they build.\nAt launch, the agents can help developers explore their project, understand its structure and metadata, then build the project and run tests to see if there are any errors and fix them, if so.\nImage Credits:Apple\nTo prepare for this launch, Apple said it worked closely with both Anthropic and OpenAI to design the new experience. Specifically, the company said it did a lot of work to optimize token usage and tool calling, so the agents would run efficiently in Xcode.\nXcode leverages MCP (Model Context Protocol) to expose its capabilities to the agents and connect them with its tools. That means that Xcode can now work with any outside MCP-compatible agent for things like project discovery, changes, file management, previews and snippets, and accessing the latest documentation.\nDevelopers who want to try the agentic coding feature should first download the agents they want to use from Xcode\u2019s settings. They can also connect their accounts with the AI providers by signing in or adding their API key. A drop-down menu within the app allows developers to choose which version of the model they want to use (e.g. GPT-5.2-Codex vs. GPT-5.1 mini).\nIn a prompt box on the left side of the screen, developers can tell the agent what sort of project they want to build or change to the code they want to make using natural language commands. For instance, they could direct Xcode to add a feature to their app that uses one of Apple\u2019s provided frameworks, and how it should appear and function.\nImage Credits:Apple\nAs the agent starts working, it breaks down tasks into smaller steps, so it\u2019s easy to see what\u2019s happening and how the code is changing. It will also look for the documentation it needs before it begins coding. The changes are highlighted visually within the code, and the project transcript on the side of the screen allows developers to learn what\u2019s happening under the hood.\nThis transparency could particularly help new developers who are learning to code, Apple believes. To that end, the company is hosting a \u201ccode-along\u201d workshop on Thursday on its developer site, where users can watch and learn how to use agentic coding tools as they code along in real time with their own copy of Xcode.\nAt the end of its process, the AI agent verifies that the code it created works as expected. Armed with the results of its tests on this front, the agent can iterate further on the project if need be to fix errors or other problems. (Apple noted that asking the agent to think through its plans before writing code can sometimes help to improve the process, as it forces the agent to do some pre-planning.)\nPlus, if developers are not happy with the results, they can easily revert their code back to its original at any point in time, as Xcode creates milestones every time the agent makes a change.\n\ntitle2:\nSkyryse lands another $300M to make flying, even helicopters, simple and safe\ndescription2:\nSkyryse, an El Segundo, California-based aviation automation startup, has raised more than $300 million in a Series C investment, pushing its valuation to $1.15 billion and into unicorn territory.\nThe round, which was announced Tuesday and led by Autopilot Ventures, provided a multimillion-dollar accelerant for the startup as it nears the end of a lengthy Federal Aviation Administration certification process for its flight control system. The capital will also be used to integrate its operating system, known as SkyOS, across numerous aircraft, including U.S. military Black Hawk helicopters.\nOther investors in this round include Fidelity Management & Research Company, ArrowMark Partners, Atreides Management LP, BAM Elevate, Baron Capital Group, Durable Capital Partners, Positive Sum, Qatar Investment Authority, RCM Private Markets Fund managed by Rokos Capital Management, and Woodline Partners. The startup, which was founded in 2016, has raised more than $605 million in equity capital.\nImage Credits:Skyryse\nSkyryse has made inroads with investors as well as the U.S. military, emergency medical service operators, law enforcement, and private operators for its simplified flight system. The startup has stripped out dozens of mechanical flight controls like gauges and switches and replaced them with a system containing several flight computers that automate the more complicated and dangerous aspects of flying.\nThis is not a fully autonomous system; a pilot must still handle the operations. But it\u2019s designed to automate the trickiest aspects of flying, enhance the skills of pilots, and improve safety.\nThat simplicity and ease of operation \u2014 a literal swipe of the finger on a touchscreen \u2014 has won over companies like United Rotorcraft, Air Methods, and Mitsubishi Corporation, which have contracts with Skyryse to integrate SkyOS on a variety of helicopters and airplanes.\nSkyryse started building and testing its system on helicopters, one of the most unstable aircraft to operate. But the idea is that SkyOS can be applied to any aircraft. That initial operating system, known as Skyryse One, automates takeoff and landing and fully automates hover and engine-out emergency landings. The company has since integrated the operating system on Black Hawk helicopters.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Skyryse must now complete formal flight testing and verification to achieve full certification.\n\ntitle3:\nFrench police search X office in Paris, summon Elon Musk for questioning\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nFrench police and Europol searched the local office of X, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office announced on Tuesday.\nThe raid is part of an ongoing investigation launched in 2025 on allegations of \u201cfraudulent extraction of data\u201d of an automated data-processing system \u201cby an organized group.\u201d\nFrench prosecutors\u2019 cybercrime unit said the investigation has now been expanded to cover other alleged crimes, including complicity in possession and distribution of child sexual abuse material, privacy violations, and Holocaust denial.\nThe expansion of the investigation comes as X and its owner Elon Musk face widespread criticism for allowing its Grok AI to be used to generate nonconsensual imagery, including child abuse imagery, of other people on its platform.\nMusk, who bought X (previously Twitter) in 2022, and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino were summoned for questioning on April 20. Unnamed X staffers were also summoned for the same week, per the prosecutor\u2019s announcement.\nWhen reached for comment, X spokesperson Rosemarie Esposito referred to a statement posted on X\u2019s Global Government Affairs account, in which the company said \u201cthe allegations underlying today\u2019s raid are baseless and X categorically denies any wrongdoing.\u201d\nA spokesperson for eMed, where Yaccarino is now the chief executive, did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Lores, who has been the chair of PayPal\u2019s board since July 2024, will also take up the role of president.\nPayPal said the appointment was made because the company\u2019s pace of change and execution was \u201cnot in line with the Board\u2019s expectations\u201d given broader market trends.\nChriss joined PayPal in September 2023 from Intuit, succeeding Dan Schulman. PayPal\u2019s CFO and COO, Jamie Miller, will take over as interim CEO until Lores joins the company.\nThe appointment comes as PayPal on Tuesday reported lower than expected revenue and profit in the fourth quarter, as consumer spending dipped amid a broader cost of living crisis and a softening labor market. The company also forecast a dip in its full-year profit, which surprised investors, as Wall Street had broadly expected the company to forecast growth instead.\nPayPal\u2019s shares were down about 17.9% in premarket trading on Tuesday.\nLores, who served as president and CEO of HP for over six years, said that apart from product innovation, PayPal will hold itself accountable for delivering quarterly accounts.\n\u201cThe payments industry is changing faster than ever, driven by new technologies, evolving regulations, an increasingly competitive landscape, and the rapid acceleration of AI that is reshaping commerce daily. PayPal sits at the center of this change, and I look forward to leading the team to accelerate the delivery of new innovations and to shape the future of digital payments and commerce,\u201d Lores said in a statement.\"\n\nResponse:",
