Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday October 8), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title1:\nAnthropic and IBM announce strategic partnership\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nTech behemoth IBM is teaming up with AI research lab Anthropic to bring AI into its software.\nArmonk, New York-based IBM announced it will be adding Anthropic\u2019s Claude large language model family into some of its software products on Tuesday. The first product to tap Claude will be IBM\u2019s integrated development environment, which is already available to a select group of customers.\nIBM also announced it created a guide in partnership with Anthropic on how enterprises can build, deploy, and maintain enterprise-grade AI agents.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out to IBM for more information on the future of the partnership.\nAnthropic has been making a big push into the enterprise sector since it released Claude Enterprise in September 2024.\nThe company also announced a deal to bring Claude to consulting giant Deloitte\u2019s nearly 500,000-person global workforce on Monday. Anthropic said this would be the largest enterprise rollout for the company yet.\nA July study conducted by Menlo Ventures found that enterprises prefer Claude models over any other AI models, including OpenAI\u2019s. The study found that usage of OpenAI\u2019s models by enterprises has been declining since 2023.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla reveals slightly cheaper 'standard' versions of the Model 3 and Model Y\ndescription2:\nTesla has spent more than a year teasing that \u201cmore affordable models\u201d of its vehicles were on the way, and on Tuesday, the company finally revealed them. The company is now selling a more bare-bones version of the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y SUV, which start at $36,990 and $39,990, respectively.\nThe new versions, each dubbed \u201cStandard,\u201d get an estimated 321 miles of range on a full battery, and will come with fewer features than the more premium rear-wheel or all-wheel drive variants when they ship later this year. They don\u2019t even have Autopilot, the company\u2019s basic advanced driver assistance system. (The new models only come with traffic-aware cruise control; Autosteer, which completes the \u201cAutopilot\u201d feature-set, is missing.)\nThe release of the cheaper models is supposed to help push Tesla back into growth after it saw sales decline in 2024. But the pricing is not as low as some may have hoped, especially considering that CEO Elon Musk once teased the idea of a $25,000 Tesla \u2014 before he ultimately killed that project.\nThe new Model 3 does not even dip below the $35,000 price threshold that Tesla promoted in a run-up to the car\u2019s launch in 2016. That sticker price, which helped put Tesla on the map, was never really offered save for a few months as an off-menu ordering option.\nThe new cars are more different on the inside than the outside. While Tesla\u2019s cars are known for being minimalist, the Model 3 and Model Y Standard take the spartan approach to the limit. There\u2019s no second-row touchscreen. The steering wheel and side mirrors are manually adjusted. There\u2019s no FM/AM radio and just seven speakers compared to the 15 speakers and one subwoofer on the costlier versions. Only the first row has heated seats.\nOn the outside, Tesla ditched the light bar that adorns the nose of the more expensive Model Y variants. The glass roof is also gone on the Standard cars.\nMusk and other Tesla executives have joked in the past, and at length, about playing \u201cGame of Thrones but [for] pennies\u201d \u2014 an effort to describe the company\u2019s mad scramble to remove as much cost out of its cars as possible. That strip-it-down thinking appears to be the primary strategy of how the company approached the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nTesla plans to sell these versions in multiple global markets, including Europe. The expiration of the U.S. federal EV tax credit last month means these prices will be pretty straightforward in the United States, unless buyers live somewhere with strong state EV incentives.\nThat sets up an interesting calculus for new EV buyers. Major automakers are simultaneously pulling back plans for a number of more expensive electric vehicles, theoretically reducing competition, which could be a boon for Tesla.\nFord is working on a low-cost electric vehicle platform due out in 2027. General Motors is bringing back the Chevy Bolt. Upstart automakers like Rivian and Lucid Motors, and even newer entrants like Slate Auto, are pushing to release EVs in the next few years that are priced on either side of the Model 3 and Model Y Standard.\nMusk did tangible damage to Tesla\u2019s brand earlier this year when he got involved in the second Trump administration. Tesla rebounded to notch its best quarter ever as the EV tax credit expired and it is unclear how durable that momentum will be. The new Standard models will likely apply competitive pressure on Tesla\u2019s own offerings, not to mention the potential havoc it could wreak on the used market.\n\ntitle3:\nTrump's DOE proposes cutting billions in grants for GM, Ford, and lots of startups\ndescription3:\nThe Department of Energy is looking to cut billions more in federal funding, and many promising startups as well as automakers Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis could be affected by the Trump administration\u2019s decision.\nThe proposed cuts would cancel more than $500 million of contracts awarded to more than a dozen startups, according to a TechCrunch analysis of an internal document that has not become public yet. All of the proposed cuts are grants that had been awarded under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The proposed cancellations, many of which have not been reported before, come on top of more than $7.5 billion in contracts the Trump administration said it would cut last week.\nStartups might not be the only losers. Other companies slated to lose grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars include Daimler Trucks North America, Ford, General Motors, Harley-Davidson, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Stellantis, and Volvo Technology of America, according to the document viewed by TechCrunch. Sources confirmed with TechCrunch these are proposed cuts.\nGeneral Motors could lose at least $500 million in grant money issued from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. The money was going to be used to retool the Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan. The automaker announced in July 2024 it planned to produce electrified vehicles, including hybrids, at the plant.\nSome of the awards are significant and, if cut, will undoubtedly affect the startups\u2019 operations. Several were included in a list of proposed cuts that leaked last week, but many are new and have yet to be announced. TechCrunch has reached out to several of the companies and will update this article if they reply.\nTwo awards on the chopping block topped $100 million, including a $189 million award granted to materials startup Brimstone. Those funds would have helped the company build a plant to produce Portland cement, alumina, and other materials using less carbon dioxide.\nThe other went to Anovion, a Chicago-based startup that is working to build a factory to produce a domestic supply of synthetic graphite for lithium-ion batteries. Currently, Chinese companies dominate the graphite market.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nBattery materials startup Li Industries received $55.2 million under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to recycle LFP batteries in an attempt to wrest part of that supply chain from China.\nOther cement startups are on the list, too. Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime Systems was given an award for $86.9 million to build an ultra-low-carbon cement plant. Mountain View-based Furno, which is making a novel, modular cement kiln, would lose its $20 million grant to build a demonstration plant in Chicago.\nSeveral building materials companies were also on the list. CleanFiber and Hempitecture, which make insulation for homes and commercial buildings, are at risk of losing $10 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Skyven Technologies, which makes industrial heat pumps, and Luxwall, which makes super-insulated windows, would lose $15 million and $31 million, respectively.\nAt least one of the proposed cancelations seemingly cuts against the administration\u2019s goals of energy and AI dominance. TS Conductor, which could lose $28.2 million in grant money, makes advanced conductors for electric lines that promise to double or triple capacity on existing transmission lines. The technology could reduce bottlenecks on the grid and improve data centers\u2019 likelihood of receiving power sooner.\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle launches its AI vibe-coding app Opal in 15 more countries\ndescription4:\nGoogle is expanding access to Opal, its AI vibe-coding app, to 15 more countries. The app, which lets you create mini web apps using text prompts, is now available in Canada, India, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1, Honduras, Argentina, and Pakistan.\n\u201cWhen we opened up Opal to users in the U.S. we anticipated they might build simple, fun tools,\u201d said Megan Li, a senior product manager at Google Labs, in a blog post. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect the surge of sophisticated, practical and highly creative Opal apps we got instead. The ingenuity of these early adopters made one thing clear: we need to get Opal into the hands of more creators globally.\u201d\nOpal works by getting users to enter a description of the app they want to make, after which the tool uses different Google models to do so. Once the app is ready, users can open the editor panel to view and customize the visual workflow of inputs, outputs, and generation steps. They can click any step to review or edit the prompt, or add new steps manually using Opal\u2019s toolbar. Users can also publish their app to the web and share a link so others can test it with their own Google accounts.\nIn addition to the expansion, Google also announced improvements coming to Opal.\nThe tech giant says it has improved the debugging program but intentionally kept it no-code. Users can now run their workflow step by step in the visual editor or tweak specific steps in the console. Errors show up right where they happen to provide immediate context and eliminate guesswork.\nGoogle also says that it\u2019s made significant improvements to Opal\u2019s core performance. The company notes that previously it would take up to five seconds or more to create a new Opal. Now, it\u2019s worked to speed that up to make it easier to get started. Plus, users can now run steps in parallel, allowing complex workflows with multiple steps to execute simultaneously.\nWith the U.S. launch of Opal in July, Google joined a growing list of competitors including Canva, Figma, and Replit that are building tools to help nontechnical users design app prototypes without writing any code.\"\n\nResponse:",
