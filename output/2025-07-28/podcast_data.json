Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

The idea is that the AI can become a helper that can understand what the user is researching, predict what they want to do, and then take action on their behalf.\nHow well it works in practice remains to be seen, but Microsoft notes that Copilot Mode is still considered an experimental feature. It\u2019s also opt-in by default during these tests and is currently free for any Mac or PC users with access to Copilot.\nThere are a few main components to Copilot Mode at launch, with more on the way.\nOnce enabled, Edge users will be presented with a new tab page where they can search, chat, and navigate the web with Copilot\u2019s assistance. When visiting a specific web page, they can also turn to Copilot for more help. For example, Microsoft shows how someone might ask the AI companion if a recipe they\u2019re viewing could be made vegan instead, and Copilot suggests substitutions.\nThis type of question is something users might ask an AI chatbot today, but this saves the step of having to paste in the content they want to reference.\nOr, someone could just ask the AI to simply present the recipe itself so they can skip reading through the \u201clife story\u201d that now accompanies so many online recipes.\nImage Credits:Microsoft\nIn addition, Microsoft claims that Copilot can handle a variety of tasks on a user\u2019s behalf, like booking appointments, creating shopping lists, and drafting content.\nThis \u201cagentic\u201d use of the web is the next big leap in the AI browser race, but it\u2019s unclear if consumer adoption will naturally follow. The goal, of course, is to make it easier to perform everyday tasks, like reserving a room on Booking.com or a flight via Kayak. However, chatting back-and-forth with an AI to go through the options and your needs isn\u2019t necessarily better or faster than just doing it yourself, depending on your familiarity with the website in question.\nStill, Copilot does allow for voice input, which could be handy for people who aren\u2019t as tech-savvy when it comes to booking things online, or for those who have limited mobility. (Later on, Microsoft says users will be able to give Copilot the additional context it needs, like credentials or history, to manage more advanced actions, like bookings. For now, it\u2019s a bit more manual.)\nWhat\u2019s more interesting, perhaps, is Copilot\u2019s ability to be a research companion. With the user\u2019s permission, Copilot can view all open tabs to understand what the person is browsing. This could be useful if they\u2019re doing some type of product comparison or online research, like pricing flights or hotels across multiple sites. Again, these are use cases for AI chatbots, but baking it into the browser could speed up the process of translating the user\u2019s needs to the digital helper.\nIn the future, Copilot will also prompt people to pick up where they left off on a project or something they\u2019re researching, by recommending next steps, Microsoft says.\nThe company stresses that Copilot will only be able to access someone\u2019s browsing content when they choose to allow it, and this will be made transparent to the end user with visual cues. However, the idea that you can now toggle on or off a feature that\u2019s able to view and listen to you while you search could leave some people unsettled.\n\ntitle1:\nWaymo taps Avis to manage robotaxi fleet in Dallas\ndescription1:\nWaymo said it plans to launch a robotaxi service next year in Dallas, the latest city to be added to the Alphabet-owned company\u2019s growing commercial footprint that already includes Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nThis time around, Waymo is partnering with Avis Budget Group to manage its fleet of all-electric autonomous Jaguar I-Pace vehicles. Avis will handle general depot operations, including charging and maintaining the vehicles. Users will be able to hail a robotaxi through the Waymo app.\nWaymo has partnered with other companies before, including Uber in Austin and Atlanta and Moove in Phoenix. Avis is the first rental car company to help Waymo manage its fleet. And it\u2019s a partnership that will likely extend to other cities in the future.\nWaymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli said Avis will play a large in role helping the company scale its technology to new markets faster and more cost-effectively. He added that Waymo and Avis Budget Group intend to expand to more cities together over time.\nClose followers of Waymo may not be surprised by the Dallas launch announcement. Earlier this year, Waymo took one of its \u201croad trips\u201d to Dallas, where the company used its sensor-laden vehicles to map the city and conduct initial testing. Since then, Waymo has started testing its autonomous vehicles on public roads with a human safety operator behind the wheel. As it has in every other city it has launched in, Waymo will progress to fully autonomous testing once its tech has been further validated on Dallas streets.\nBonelli wouldn\u2019t disclose precise launch dates or how many vehicles would be in the initial robotaxi fleet. He did say Waymo will scale the fleet with Avis to hundreds of vehicles over time.\nAvis Budget Group CEO Brian Choi said the partnership marks a \u201cpivotal milestone in its evolution, from a rental car company to a leading provider of fleet management, infrastructure and operations to the broader mobility ecosystem.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Now it\u2019s sold that platform and delivered a \u201cmassive return on investment for Flexport.\u201d\nFlexport announced the sale on Monday to DAT Freight & Analytics but declined to disclose terms.\n\u201cOver the past 18 months, we rebuilt and relaunched the [Convoy] platform as a neutral digital freight execution layer that serves brokers, carriers, and shippers across the market,\u201d Flexport founder and CEO Ryan Petersen said in a statement. \u201cThat investment paid off. The platform is now stronger, more widely used, and far more valuable than when we acquired it. As the Convoy Platform matured, it was clear that to achieve its full potential, it needed to be a neutral infrastructure layer.\u201d\nPetersen wrote that the sale of Convoy\u2019s tech will allow his company to \u201cfocus our capital and energy on our core business\u201d of helping customers move freight around the world.\nThe sale comes just a few months after Flexport announced the rollout of a suite of AI-powered tools, and a plan to launch waves of new products for its customers twice a year \u2014 an approach inspired by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky.\nFlexport told TechCrunch at the time that the second product release will come in \u201clate summer.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nHarmonic, the Robinhood CEO's AI math startup, launches an AI chatbot app\ndescription3:\nHarmonic, an AI startup co-founded by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, announced Monday the beta launch of an iOS and Android chatbot app where users can access its AI model, Aristotle.\nWith this launch, the company aims to broaden access to Aristotle, which Harmonic claims to offer \u201challucination-free\u201d answers for questions involving mathematical reasoning \u2014 a bold claim given the reliability problems of today\u2019s AI models. Harmonic is focused on creating \u201cmathematical superintelligence\u201d or MSI; the startup eventually wants to help users with all fields that rely on math, including physics, statistics, and computer science.\n\u201c[Aristotle] is the first product available to people that does reasoning and formally verifies the output,\u201d said Harmonic CEO and co-founder Tudor Achim in an interview with TechCrunch. \u201cWithin the domains that Aristotle supports, which are quantitative reasoning domains, we actually do guarantee that there\u2019s no hallucinations.\u201d\nEventually, Harmonic says it also plans to release an API to let enterprises access Aristotle, as well as a web app for consumers.\nHarmonic says Aristotle achieved gold medal performance on the 2025 International Math Olympiad (IMO) through a formal test (meaning the problems were translated into a machine\u2011readable format). Google and OpenAI also developed AI models that achieved gold medal performance on this year\u2019s IMO, but through informal tests taken in natural language.\nHarmonic says it\u2019s not releasing other benchmarks for Aristotle at this time.\nThe beta launch of Aristotle comes just a few weeks since Harmonic raised $100 million in a Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins at an $875 million valuation. Achim claims that Harmonic is \u201cadvancing very rapidly along\u201d its path to achieving MSI and that investors believed that was a fair valuation given the scope of his startup\u2019s ambition.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nSeveral leading tech companies are focused on training their AI models to solve math problems. AI that can do math is valuable in its own right, but math is also considered a uniquely verifiable domain that demands core reasoning skills. Systems that develop these capabilities may prove useful in other domains as well.\nAchim says that Harmonic achieves its hyper-accurate solutions by having Aristotle produce responses in the open source programming language Lean. Before Aristotle gives an answer to users, he says the model double-checks that the solution is correct through an algorithmic process that doesn\u2019t involve AI. Harmonic\u2019s CEO notes that similar technology is used to verify outputs in high-stakes fields such as medical devices and aviation.\nEven in a narrow domain, achieving hallucination-free performance from an AI model is an incredibly difficult task. Studies have found that even leading AI models hallucinate a lot, and the problem doesn\u2019t appear to be getting better. OpenAI\u2019s latest AI reasoning models hallucinate more than its older ones.\n\ntitle4:\nAI data analyst startup Julius nabs $10M seed round\ndescription4:\nJulius AI, a startup that describes itself as an AI data analyst, announced it has raised a $10 million seed round led by Bessemer Venture Partners.\nHorizon VC, 8VC, Y Combinator, the AI Grant accelerator participated in the round along with several high-profile angel investors, including Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, Vercel CEO Guillermo Rauch, and Twilio co-founder Jeff Lawson, among others.\nFounder Rahul Sonwalkar launched Julius after graduating from Y Combinator in 2022, and pivoting away from the logistics startup he\u2019d been building during the accelerator program.\nJulius is designed to act like a data scientist by analyzing and visualizing extensive datasets and then performing predictive modeling from natural language prompts. Even with functionality similar to that found in ChatGPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and Google\u2019s Gemini, Julius has carved out its own niche. The company said it has more than two million users and generates more than 10 million visualizations.\n\u201cThe easiest way to use Julius is to just talk to it,\u201d Julius AI founder Rahul Sonwalkar told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. \u201cYou can talk to the AI like you would talk to an analyst on your team, and the AI, like a human would go, run the code and do the analysis for you.\u201d\nQuestions that Julius can answer and present in a chart include: \u201cCan you visualize how revenue and net income correlate for different industries in China versus US?\u201d\nJulius\u2019 specialization in data science even caught the eye of Harvard Business School (HBS) professor Iavor Bojinov last year. Bojinov was so impressed he asked Sonwalkar to modify Julius specifically for HBS\u2019 new required course called Data Science and AI for Leaders.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The morning after Elon Musk acquired Twitter (now X), reporters encountered two men with boxes outside of the company\u2019s headquarters. One of the two men was Sonwalkar, who introduced himself as a recently laid-off Twitter engineer \u201cRahul Ligma.\u201d\nDespite some notoriety gained from the stunt, Somwalkar insists that his startup is a lot more attention-worthy.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think many people know me for that anymore,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an earlier interview. \u201cI get recognized for Julius a lot more now.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
