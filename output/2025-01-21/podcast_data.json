Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday January 22), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nOpenAI teams up with SoftBank and Oracle on $500B data center project\ndescription0:\nOpenAI says that it will team up with Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and with Oracle, among others, to build multiple data centers for AI in the U.S.\nThe joint venture, called the Stargate Project, will begin with a large data center project in Texas and eventually expand to other states. The companies expect to commit $100 billion to Stargate initially and pour up to $500 billion into the venture over the next four years.\nThey promise it will create \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of jobs and \u201csecure American leadership in AI.\u201d\n\u201cThe Stargate Project is a new company which intends to [build] new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States,\u201d OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank said in a joint statement. \u201cThis project will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.\u201d\nThe companies made the announcement during a press conference at the White House on Tuesday, where President Donald Trump spoke about plans for investment in U.S. infrastructure. SoftBank chief Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison were in attendance.\nMicrosoft is also involved in Stargate as a tech partner. So are Arm and Nvidia. Middle East AI fund MGX will join SoftBank in its investment; MGX\u2019s first public deal was an investment in OpenAI.\nSoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle are also listed as \u201cinitial equity investors\u201d in Stargate.\n\u201cSoftBank and OpenAI are the lead partners for Stargate, with SoftBank having financial responsibility and OpenAI having operational responsibility,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cMasayoshi Son will be the chairman [of Stargate] \u2026 As part of Stargate, Oracle, Nvidia, and OpenAI will closely collaborate to build and operate this computing system.\u201d\nThe data centers could house chips designed by OpenAI someday. The company is said to be aggressively building out a team of chip designers and engineers, and working with semiconductor firms Broadcom and TSMC to create an AI chip for running models that could arrive as soon as 2026.\nSoftBank is already an investor in OpenAI, having reportedly committed $500 million toward the AI startup\u2019s last funding round and an additional $1.5 billion to allow OpenAI staff to sell shares in a tender offer. Oracle, meanwhile, has an ongoing deal with OpenAI to supply AI computing resources.\nSoftBank also earlier pledged to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years. Son and Trump have had a close working relationship since 2016, during Trump\u2019s first term, when Son announced that SoftBank would invest $50 billion in U.S. startups and create 50,000 jobs.\nThe Information previously reported that OpenAI was negotiating with Oracle to lease an entire data center in Abilene, Texas \u2014 a data center that could reach nearly a gigawatt of electricity by mid-2026. (A gigawatt is enough to power roughly 750,000 small homes.) Data center startup Crusoe Energy was said to be involved in the project, which was estimated to cost around $3.4 billion.\nThat Abilene site will be Stargate\u2019s first site, and OpenAI says that Stargate is \u201cevaluating potential sites across the country for more campuses as [it finalizes] definitive agreements.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear what connection, if any, Stargate has to a rumored partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI to spin up a $100 billion supercomputer. TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for additional information.\nLast year, The Information reported that Microsoft and OpenAI would build a series of data centers for AI beginning in five stages over the next several years, culminating in Stargate: a 5-gigawatt facility spanning several hundred acres of land. Stargate was expected to take between five and six years to complete, according to The Information. In the lead-up to its completion, Microsoft had reportedly planned to launch a smaller-scope data center for OpenAI around 2026.\nA number of tech leaders have called for the U.S. to up its investment in data centers, particularly as the AI industry continues to grow at an explosive pace. AI systems require enormous server banks to develop and run at scale.\nGoldman Sachs estimates that AI will represent about 19% of data center power demand by 2028. OpenAI has blamed a lack of available compute for delaying its products, and compute capacity has reportedly become a source of tension between the AI company and Microsoft, its close collaborator and major investor.\nMicrosoft, which recently announced it is on track to spend $80 billion on AI data centers, said in a recent blog post that the company\u2019s success depends on \u201cnew partnerships founded on large-scale infrastructure investments.\u201d In an interview with Bloomberg, Altman said that he believes it is urgent that what he perceives as barriers to building additional data center infrastructure in the U.S. be cleared.\n\u201cThe thing I really deeply agree with [President Trump] on is, it is wild how difficult it has become to build things in the United States,\u201d Altman said in that interview. \u201cPower plants, data centers, any of that kind of stuff. I understand how bureaucratic cruft builds up, but it\u2019s not helpful to the country in general.\u201d\nMassive data center projects have vocal critics who say that data centers often create fewer jobs than promised and tend to have severe environmental impacts. Data centers are typically water hungry, placing a strain on regions with insufficient water resources, and their high power requirements have forced some utilities to lean heavily on fossil fuels.\nThose concerns don\u2019t appear to be slowing investments any. Per a McKinsey report, capital spending on procurement and installation of mechanical and electrical systems for data centers could eclipse $250 billion in the next five years.\nIn January, Trump announced that Hussain Sajwani, an Emirati billionaire businessman who founded the property development giant DAMAC Properties, will invest $20 billion in new data centers across the U.S. Industry insiders have expressed skepticism of the deal\u2019s concreteness, however.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft is no longer OpenAI's exclusive cloud provider\ndescription1:\nMicrosoft was once the exclusive provider of data center infrastructure for OpenAI to train and run its AI models. No longer.\nCoinciding with the announcement of Stargate, OpenAI\u2019s massive new AI infrastructure deal with SoftBank, Oracle, and others, Microsoft says it has signed a new agreement with OpenAI that gives it \u201cright of first refusal\u201d on new OpenAI cloud computing capacity. That means that, going forward, Microsoft gets first choice over whether to host OpenAI\u2019s AI workloads in the cloud \u2014 but if Microsoft can\u2019t meet its needs, OpenAI can go to a rival cloud provider.\n\u201cOpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post. \u201cTo further support OpenAI, Microsoft has approved OpenAI\u2019s ability to build additional capacity, primarily for research and training of models.\u201d\nOpenAI has blamed a lack of available compute for delaying its products, and compute capacity has reportedly become a source of tension between the AI company and Microsoft, its close collaborator and major investor. In June, Microsoft, under shareholder pressure, permitted OpenAI to ink a deal with Oracle for additional capacity.\nIn the blog post, Microsoft reiterated that \u201ckey elements\u201d of its long-standing partnership with OpenAI remain in place through 2030, including its access to OpenAI\u2019s IP, revenue-sharing arrangements, and exclusivity on OpenAI\u2019s APIs.\nThat assumes, of course, that OpenAI doesn\u2019t achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) under the two companies\u2019 agreed-upon definition before then. When OpenAI develops AI systems that can generate at least $100 billion in profits, Microsoft will lose access to the company\u2019s technology, according to a reported agreement between the firms.\nOpenAI is said to be considering nullifying the agreement in a possible bid to secure more Microsoft funding.\n\u201cThe OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure and is also available through the Azure OpenAI Service,\u201d the blog post reads. \u201cThis agreement means customers benefit from having access to leading models on Microsoft platforms and direct from OpenAI.\u201d\nWe\u2019ve reached out to OpenAI and Microsoft for more information and will update this post if we hear back.\nTechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Despite the layoffs, Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh said that Stripe intends to still grow its headcount by 17% \u201cto land at about 10,000\u201d by the end of the year. Doing the math, that means Stripe has about 8,550 employees currently.\nMcIntosh said the cuts are happening because it \u201cbecame clear there were several team-level changes needed\u201d to ensure Stripe had \u201cthe right people in the right roles and locations to execute against\u201d its plans.\nIn November 2022, Stripe announced that it was laying off 14% of its workers, impacting around 1,120 of its then 8,000-person workforce.\nThe company has long been expected to go public but has instead continued to raise funds and conduct tender offers to provide liquidity to employees. It was valued at $70 billion as of last July.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for TechCrunch Fintech here.\nWant to reach out with a tip?

The group\u2019s legal counsel includes Brad Bondi, the brother of Trump\u2019s attorney general pick, Pam Bondi.\nTikTok briefly went dark on Saturday but reinstated itself shortly before President Trump signed an executive order on Monday delaying any potential ban for 75 days.\nIt\u2019s not clear if TikTok\u2019s owner ByteDance has seriously considered the offer, Bloomberg reported. Others floated as potential buyers include Elon Musk, Amazon, Oracle, and a syndicate headed by billionaire Frank McCourt.\n\ntitle4:\nNvidia passes Apple again to become world's most valuable company\ndescription4:\nJensen Huang, Nvidia's founder, president and CEO, speaks about the future of artificial intelligence and its effect on energy consumption and production at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 27, 2024.\nNvidia passed Apple in market value on Tuesday, once again becoming the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world.\nShares of the chipmaker rose over 2% on Tuesday, and shares are up about 5% so far in 2025 after rising 171% in 2024 and nearly 239% in 2023, reflecting insatiable demand for the company's artificial intelligence chips.\nMeanwhile, Apple shares slid 3% on Tuesday. They're now down 11% this year after gaining 30% in 2024. The iPhone maker has developed its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features for its phones and laptops, but its business doesn't have the same level of exposure to the AI boom.\nNvidia has the vast majority of market share for graphics processing units, or GPUs, which have become essential for developing and deploying AI software such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. While revenue growth has slowed, it still nearly doubled to $35.08 billion in the most recent quarter.\nApple was the first company to reach the $1 trillion, $2 trillion and $3 trillion market cap milestones. Nvidia previously passed Apple in June and then again in November.\nAt Tuesday's close, Nvidia had a market cap of about $3.45 trillion, versus Apple at $3.35 trillion.Microsoft is just behind them at $3.2 trillion. A major buyer of Nvidia's GPUs, Microsoft said earlier this month that it expected to spend $80 billion on AI data centers in fiscal 2025.\nIn November, Nvidia joined the Dow Industrial Average, replacing Intel, and joining Apple and Microsoft in the blue-chip index.\nWATCH: Nvidia's outperformance will continue and growth rates will remain higher\"\n\nResponse:",
