Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

And based on the company\u2019s results, there may be reason to.\nNvidia reported revenue of $57 billion in the third quarter, 62% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The company\u2019s net income on a GAAP basis was $32 billion, 65% higher year-over-year. Both revenue and profit results beat Wall Street expectations.\nThe revenue picture shows a company booming thanks largely to its data center business. Revenue generated by Nvidia\u2019s data center business was a record $51.2 billion, up 25% from the previous quarter and up 66% from a year ago. The remaining $5.8 billion in revenue came from Nvidia\u2019s gaming business with $4.2 billion, followed by sales in professional visualization and automotive.\nNvidia\u2019s CFO Colette Kress noted in a statement to shareholders its data center business has been fueled by an acceleration of computing, powerful AI models, and agentic applications. During the company\u2019s Q3 call, Kress said in this past quarter, the company announced AI factory and infrastructure projects amounting to an aggregate of 5 million GPUs.\n\u201cThis demand spans every market, CSPs, sovereigns, modern builders enterprises and super computing centers, and includes multiple landmark build outs,\u201d Kress said.\nBlackwell Ultra, a GPU unveiled in March and available in several configurations, has been particularly strong and is now the leader within the company. Previous versions of the Blackwell architecture also saw continued strong demand, according to the company.\nHuang said sales of its Blackwell GPU chips \u201care off the charts.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cBlackwell sales are off the charts, and cloud GPUs are sold out,\u201d Huang said in the company\u2019s Q3 earnings statement. \u201cCompute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We\u2019ve entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once.\u201d\nKress did note that the company\u2019s shipments of H20, a data center GPU designed for generative AI and high-performance computing, were 50 million, a disappointing result due to its inability to sell to China.\n\u201cSizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,,\u201d Kress noted on the earnings call. \u201cWhile we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments, and will continue to advocate for America\u2019s ability to compete around the world.\u201d\nImportantly, Nvidia is forecasting more growth with a projected revenue of $65 billion in the fourth quarter, helping push its share price up more than 4% in after-hours trading.\nThe upshot, at least in Huang\u2019s view: forget about the bubble, there is only growth.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\u201d Jensen said during the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cFrom our vantage point, we see something very different.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nAdobe to buy Semrush for $1.9 billion\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nAdobe said on Wednesday that it has agreed to acquire search engine optimization company Semrush for about $1.9 billion in cash, as the Photoshop maker seeks to augment its suite of marketing offerings.\nIn a statement, Adobe said it would offer $12 per share for Semrush, almost double the latter\u2019s closing price of $6.89 on Tuesday, before news of the deal. Semrush had a market capitalization of about $1 billion as of Tuesday\u2019s close.\nBy acquiring Semrush, Adobe is betting that companies will choose to invest in optimizing their content and web pages to be more visible to AI tools, as people increasingly use AI chatbots, agents, and AI browsers to do everything from getting the news and finding recipes to shopping and booking their travel. This is a fresh, big market for existing search engine optimization players like Semrush, particularly as this change in consumer behavior drives increasing traffic to websites from generative AI tools.\nIndeed, as of October, traffic to retail websites from generative AI chatbots increased 1,200% compared to a year earlier, per Adobe Analytics data.\nSemrush has been investing in what it calls \u201cgenerative engine optimization,\u201d and recently launched a tool for tracking and improving website performance using both traditional SEO techniques and optimization for AI engines, like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, Grok, and Perplexity.\n\u201cBrand visibility is being reshaped by generative AI, and brands that don\u2019t embrace this new opportunity risk losing relevance and revenue,\u201d said Anil Chakravarthy, president of Adobe\u2019s Digital Experience Business. \u201cWith Semrush, we\u2019re unlocking GEO for marketers as a new growth channel alongside their SEO, driving more visibility, customer engagement and conversions across the ecosystem.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nSpotify acquires music database WhoSampled\ndescription2:\nSpotify has acquired the community-run database tracking sampled music, WhoSampled, the company announced Wednesday. The streaming service had also shared the news as part of its Wednesday blog post about new song credits features.\nDeal terms were not disclosed, but Spotify confirmed to TechCrunch the acquisition is for both the WhoSampled team and database. (The company had only a handful of employees, per data on PitchBook and LinkedIn, which both confirm around 10 staffers.)\nLaunched in 2008, London-based WhoSampled offers an extensive database of songs, samples, covers, remixes, artists, and more. According to its website, it\u2019s now tracking more than 1.2 million songs and nearly 622,000 samples. That data is powering Spotify\u2019s latest features, like its upcoming music discovery tool SongDNA, also announced on Wednesday.\nImage Credits:Spotify\nHowever, WhoSampled was known to Spotify for some time, as it had partnered with the streamer back in 2016 to allow its users to access their Spotify playlists and saved tracks in its app.\nIn WhoSampled\u2019s announcement about the acquisition, the company said its stand-alone platform and brand would remain after the deal\u2019s closure, and it expected to offer some user-facing improvements as it becomes part of Spotify\u2019s larger business. For instance, the company said moderation times for submissions would be sped up, the site will be able to remove display ads in the weeks ahead, and its mobile apps will become free downloads with free subscriptions.\n\u201cThrough our recent discussions with Spotify, it became clear that we share a strong belief in the power of musical context \u2014 and a vision for helping listeners go deeper into the songs they love,\u201d the post penned by the WhoSampled team reads. \u201cSpotify has shown a genuine commitment to our mission, and we couldn\u2019t have found a better home for WhoSampled,\u201d it stated.\n\ntitle3:\nRising data center electricity use risks blackouts during winter storms\ndescription3:\nThe explosive growth of data centers could threaten the stability of the electrical grid this winter, according to an industry overseer.\nAcross North America, demand for electricity this winter is expected to be 2.5% higher than last year for a total of 20 gigawatts, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) said in a report released this week. In recent years, winter demand grew by 1% or less.\nData centers are driving a significant chunk of that growth, especially in the mid-Atlantic, U.S. West, and U.S. Southeast, \u201careas where a lot of data center development is occurring,\u201d Mark Olson, NERC manager of reliability assessments, told E&E News.\nThe report specifically calls out data center expansion in Texas, saying that it is \u201ccontributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls.\u201d That stat might be particularly worrisome to Texans, who nearly five years ago suffered through massive power outages during an intense cold snap.\nAt the time, natural gas power plants tripped offline as wellheads froze, slashing the supply of natural gas. Meanwhile, demand for the fossil fuel soared as residential and commercial customers tried to keep homes and offices warm. (The governor publicly blamed wind turbines, despite knowing that they were only a small part of the problem.)\nThis year, NERC said the situation in Texas isn\u2019t likely to be as dire as it was in February 2021, in part because so many batteries have been added to the state\u2019s grid. Those batteries can step in to provide electricity if gas-fired power plants can\u2019t deliver as intended. Plus, they can react more quickly to smaller perturbations than \u201cpeaker\u201d power plants, most of which run on natural gas and require minutes to spin up.\nStill, Texas isn\u2019t entirely in the clear.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nMost of the batteries deployed in Texas can deliver electricity for a few hours at a time. That\u2019s suitable in circumstances where demand tends to peak for a short time, like in the evening when people return from work.\nBut as NERC notes, data centers tend to draw electricity consistently throughout the day. If a prolonged cold snap hits the state, keeping those batteries sufficiently charged to deliver power to all customers \u2014 data centers included \u2014 will become more challenging, NERC said.\nIf this winter passes without a significant storm, then NERC anticipates no problems with any region\u2019s electrical grid. But over the last five years, there have been four severe storms, the organization said, which could force grid operators to import electricity, ask large customers to curtail their use, or as a last resort institute rolling blackouts.\n\ntitle4:\nTarget joins OpenAI\u2019s growing list of retail apps\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI is pushing deeper into retail, with Target set to debut a new ChatGPT-powered app for shoppers in coming weeks.\nThe news follows OpenAI\u2019s move last month to start adding dedicated retail apps to ChatGPT, including Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow. It also comes as OpenAI races to rake in AI-driven commerce via new products like \u201cInstant Checkout\u201d that let users make purchases within conversations with retailers like Etsy and Shopify.\nThe Target app in ChatGPT will launch in beta next week, and it will let shoppers ask for ideas, browse, and build multi-item baskets, shop for food, and check out, according to OpenAI.\nThe deal deepens OpenAI\u2019s existing enterprise partnership with Target. Target will now roll out ChatGPT Enterprise across its 18,000 employees at its headquarters to be used for things like better supply chain forecasting and streamlining store processes. Target will also further integrate OpenAI\u2019s models into digital tools that power everything from employee support and customer service to AI-driven shopping assistants and personalized gift finders.\"\n\nResponse:",
