Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

His sources say that the Siri chatbot, which would be integrated into iOS 27, could be the focal point of Apple\u2019s WWDC presentation in June.\nThe Siri chatbot, internally codenamed \u201cCampos,\u201d will work with both voice and text inputs. Apple senior vice president Craig Federighi had previously stated that he didn\u2019t want Siri to be a chatbot, and rather, that he wanted Apple\u2019s AI options to be \u201cintegrated so it\u2019s there within reach whenever you need it.\u201d But it appears that the game plan has changed amid increased pressure from the success of other companies\u2019 AI chatbots.\nApple may also sense a potential threat because OpenAI is planning to enter the hardware space, led by none other than former Apple design head Jony Ive.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Apple has been lagging behind in the AI race. The company delayed its rollout of a \u201cmore personalized Siri\u201d multiple times and spent last year shopping around for an AI partner, testing out the technology of competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic for a potential deal. Ultimately, Apple chose Google\u2019s Gemini as its AI partner, which the two tech giants confirmed earlier this month.\n\ntitle1:\nNot to be outdone by OpenAI, Apple is reportedly developing an AI wearable\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nApple may be developing its own AI wearable, according to a report published Wednesday by The Information. The device will be a pin that users can wear on their clothing, and that comes equipped with two cameras and three microphones, the report says.\nShould the rumored device come to market, it would mark another sign that the AI hardware market is heating up. This news follows comments made Monday by OpenAI Chief Global Affairs Officer Chris Lehane, who told a Davos crowd that his company will likely announce its highly anticipated first AI hardware device in the second half of this year. Additional reporting suggests that the device may be a pair of earbuds.\nApple\u2019s device is described as a \u201cthin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum-and-glass shell,\u201d which engineers hope to make the same size as an AirTag, \u201conly slightly thicker.\u201d The pin will also have two cameras (one with a standard lens and another with a wide-angle) for pictures and video, as well as a physical button, a speaker, and a Fitbit-like charging strip on its back, according to the report.\nApple may even be in the process of trying to accelerate development of this product to compete with OpenAI\u2019s. The pin could potentially be released in 2027 and involve 20 million units at launch, the report notes. TechCrunch reached out to Apple for more information.\nBut it remains to be seen if consumers want this kind of AI device. Two Apple alums previously founded Humane AI, a startup which also sold an AI pin. Humane\u2019s pin also included built-in microphones and a camera. However, it floundered upon release, and the company had to shut down operations and sell its assets to HP within two years of its product launch.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenEvidence hits $12B valuation, with new round led by Thrive, DST\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nVCs who have backed OpenEvidence are apparently not worried about new health information products from OpenAI and Anthropic.\nOn Wednesday, the startup announced that it raised an additional $250 million in Series D funding at a $12 billion valuation, co-led by Thrive Capital and DST.\nThat\u2019s double the valuation from its last raise in October: $200 million at $6 billion, led by GV. It has now raised a total of $700 million, the company says, from backers including Sequoia, Nvidia, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Bond, Craft Ventures, Mayo Clinic, and others.\nOpenEvidence is an AI-powered medical information platform, similar to what WebMD was for the previous internet generation, but it\u2019s geared toward doctors. This puts it somewhat more in competition with Anthropic\u2019s Claude for Healthcare, which is intended for patients, payers, and providers, whereas ChatGPT\u2019s new health product is aimed more at consumers.\nThe company says that the free, ad-supported platform served 18 million clinical consultations from verified healthcare professionals in the U.S. in December alone. That compares to about 3 million searches per month a year ago. It also said that it had surpassed $100 million in revenue.\n\ntitle3:\nBlue Origin's satellite internet network TeraWave will move data at 6 Tbps\ndescription3:\nJeff Bezos\u2019 space company Blue Origin has just announced a satellite internet network called TeraWave, which will be capable of offering data speeds up to 6 Tbps, and geared toward enterprise, data center, and government customers.\nThe TeraWave constellation will use a mix of 5,280 satellites in low-Earth orbit and 128 in medium-Earth orbit, and Blue Origin plans to deploy the first ones in late 2027. It\u2019s not immediately clear how long Blue Origin expects it will take to build out the whole network.\nThe low-Earth orbit satellites Blue Origin is building will use RF connectivity and have a max data transfer speed of 144 Gbps, while the medium-Earth variety will use an optical link that can achieve the much higher 6 Tbps speed. For reference, SpaceX\u2019s Starlink currently maxes out at 400 Mbps \u2014 though it plans to launch upgraded satellites that will offer 1 Gbps data transfer in the future.\n\u201cTeraWave adds a space-based layer to your existing network infrastructure, providing connectivity to locations unreachable by traditional methods,\u201d the new website for the satellite network reads.\nThe announcement of the TeraWave network comes just a few months after Bezos\u2019 other company, Amazon, announced a rebrand of its own satellite network geared toward consumers. That network, called Leo, will ultimately consist of around 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit and offers more traditional broadband speeds.\nTaken together, these two networks could provide more robust competition to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, which has become the leading satellite internet provider with more than 9 million customers. Starlink currently sells its connectivity to regular consumers, commercial customers (like airlines), and governments.\nThat said, the two networks from Amazon and Blue Origin are distinct.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cWe identified an unmet need with customers who were seeking enterprise-grade internet access with higher speeds, symmetrical upload/download speeds, more redundancy, and rapid scalability for their networks. TeraWave solves for these problems,\u201d Blue Origin said in a statement to TechCrunch.\nBlue Origin has spent years in development on a number of projects, and is best-known for the short trips to space it offers on its small New Shepard rocket.\nThe company has recently started to emerge as a multi-faceted commercial space player. In 2025, the company successfully launched its mega-rocket, New Glenn, for the first time and then repeated the feat months later. It also landed the booster stage on just its second attempt, and launched its first commercial payload for NASA.\nThe company plans to send a robotic lander to the surface of the moon this year on the third New Glenn launch. Now, with TeraWave, it will add \u201csatellite manufacturer and operator\u201d to its growing list of offerings.\n\ntitle4:\nSources: Project SGLang spins out as RadixArk with $400M valuation as inference market explodes\ndescription4:\nA pattern is emerging in the AI infrastructure world: popular open source tools are transforming into venture-backed startups worth hundreds of millions of dollars. The latest example is RadixArk, the commercial company behind SGLang, an increasingly popular tool that helps AI models run faster and cheaper.\nRadixArk was recently valued at about $400 million in a funding round led by Accel, according to two people familiar with the matter, a notable amount for a startup that was only announced last August. TechCrunch could not confirm the size of the funding.\nThe news comes as some of the team responsible for maintaining SGLang, which is used by companies like xAI and Cursor to accelerate AI model training, has transitioned to the recently launched commercial startup. RadixArk originated as SGLang in 2023 inside the UC Berkeley lab of Databricks co-founder Ion Stoica.\nThe startup previously raised angel capital from investors, including Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, the people said.\nYing Sheng, a key contributor to SGLang and a former engineer at xAI, left Elon Musk\u2019s AI startup to become the co-founder and CEO of RadixArk, according to a LinkedIn announcement she made last month. Sheng was previously a research scientist at Databricks.\nRadixArk\u2019s Ying Sheng, Accel, and Lip-Bu Tan did not respond to a request for comment.\nBoth SGLang and RadixArk focus on optimizing inference processing \u2014 essentially allowing models to run faster and more efficiently on the same hardware. Together with model training, inference represents a large portion of the server costs associated with AI services. As a result, tools that optimize the process can create enormous savings almost immediately.\nTechcrunch event Disrupt 2026 Tickets: One-time offer Tickets are live!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nRadixArk isn\u2019t alone in making this transition from open source project to well-funded startup. vLLM, a more mature project for optimizing inference, has also made the leap. The newly formed company has had conversations about raising upwards of $160 million in funding at a valuation of about $1 billion, Forbes reported last month.\nThree people familiar with that deal tell TechCrunch that Andreessen Horowitz is leading the investment into vLLM, though the final numbers of that investment remain to be seen. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment. vLLM co-founder Simon Mo characterized the information about this round \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d in a statement to TechCrunch, though he declined to specify which details were incorrect.\nLike SGLang, vLLM was incubated in Ion Stoica\u2019s lab at UC Berkeley. Stoica, a professor at UC Berkeley, is the famed co-founder of Databricks as well as a number of other startups.\nSeveral large tech companies already run their inference workloads using vLLM, and SGLang has also gained significant popularity over the last six months, Brittany Walker, a general partner at CRV, told TechCrunch. Her firm did not back either company.\nRadixArk is continuing to develop SGLang as an open source AI model engine. The startup is also building Miles, a specialized framework designed for reinforcement learning, which allows businesses to train AI models to become smarter over time.\nWhile most of its tools remain free, RadixArk has started charging fees for hosting services, a person familiar with the company told TechCrunch.\nStartups providing inference infrastructure for developers have seen a surge in funding in recent months, underscoring the continued importance of the inference layer for AI. Baseten recently secured $300 million at a $5 billion valuation, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. This follows a similar move by rival Fireworks AI, which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation last October.\"\n\nResponse:",
