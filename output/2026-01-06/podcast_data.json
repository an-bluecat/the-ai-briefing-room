Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

This past weekend, X users asked Grok to create sexualized deepfakes of real people \u2014 including children. Instead of refusing these requests or activating any sort of guardrail, Grok complied, effectively generating child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and other nonconsensual sexual content of real people.\nxAI is now under investigation by international authorities in the European Union, the United Kingdom, India, Malaysia, and France.\n\ntitle1:\nCES 2026: Everything revealed, from Nvidia\u2019s debuts to AMD\u2019s new chips to Razer\u2019s AI oddities\ndescription1:\nCES 2026 is in full swing in Las Vegas, with the show floor open to the public after a packed couple of days occupied by press conferences from the likes of Nvidia, Sony, and AMD and previews from Sunday\u2019s Unveiled event.\nAs has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies\u2019 messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We\u2019ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.\nLet\u2019s dive right in, starting with some of Monday\u2019s biggest players.\nNvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company\u2019s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.\nThe Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.\nAnd Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company\u2019s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.\nAMD\u2019s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships\nAMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nBeyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD\u2019s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.\nBoston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots\nHyundai\u2019s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they\u2019re working with Google\u2019s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.\nAmazon\u2019s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you\u2019d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon\u2019s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.\nOn the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.\nRazer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko\nIn the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.\nThen there\u2019s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We\u2019ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.\nLego Smart Bricks mark the company\u2019s first CES appearance\nLego joined CES for the first time to hold a behind-closed-doors showcase of its Smart Play System, which includes bricks, tiles and Minifigures that can all interact with each other and play sounds, with the debut sets both having a Star Wars theme. Senior Writer Amanda Silberling has all the details here.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta pauses international expansion of its Ray-Ban Display glasses\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nMeta is pausing its plans to sell its Ray-Ban Display glasses outside the U.S. due to \u201cunprecedented demand and limited supply,\u201d the company said on Tuesday. Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.\n\u201cSince launching last fall, we\u2019ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,\u201d the company said. \u201cBecause of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we\u2019ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.\u201d\nMeta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.\nUnveiled in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.\nAt CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.\nMeta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City.\n\ntitle3:\nIntel is building a handheld gaming platform including a dedicated chip\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nIntel is looking to double down on gaming hardware with a new chip and platform for portable gaming devices.\nThe platform will include hardware and software, Intel vice president and general manager of PC products, Daniel Rogers, announced at CES on Monday. It will be built off of the company\u2019s Intel Core Series 3 processors, known as Panther Lake, which was announced last year and is now being rolled out in a variety of PCs.\nThis future platform includes a chip specifically for handheld gaming devices, according to reporting from IGN, which was confirmed by TechCrunch.\nThese Panther Lake chips are the company\u2019s first built on its 18A manufacturing process, which started production in 2025.\nIntel is no stranger to the gaming industry and has been building chips for gaming PCs since the 1990s. The company leaned more heavily into gaming in 2022 with the release of its Intel Arc GPUs.\nEntering the handheld gaming space would be an interesting development, though, as the market is currently dominated by AMD. AMD just announced a new processor designed for gaming PCs, AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, in its CES keynote on Monday, in addition to new ray tracing and graphics technologies for gaming.\nRogers said Intel will share more details about its new products for handheld gaming devices later this year.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The Intel subsidiary and publicly traded company later expanded to tackle autonomous driving through its chips and software.\nNow, co-founder and president Amnon Shashua is taking the company into what he calls Mobileye 3.0. And that means robotics and a hefty acquisition.\nThe Israeli company announced Tuesday during CES in Las Vegas it has reached a deal to acquire Mentee Robotics \u2014 a startup co-founded by Shashua in 2022 \u2014 for $900 million. Under the agreement, Mobileye will buy Mentee Robotics for about $612 million in cash and up to 26.2 million shares of common stock. Shashua, who is the chairman, co-founder, and a significant shareholder of Mentee, recused himself from the Mobileye board\u2019s consideration and approval, according to the company.\nThe transaction, which was approved by the Mobileye board and Intel, its largest shareholder, is expected to close in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to modestly increase Mobileye\u2019s operating expenses in 2026 by a low-single-digit percentage.\n\u201cToday marks a new chapter for robotics and automotive AI, and the beginning of Mobileye 3.0,\u201d Shashua said Tuesday. \u201cBy combining Mentee\u2019s breakthroughs in humanoid robotics with Mobileye\u2019s expertise in automotive autonomy, and its proven ability to productize advanced AI, we have a unique opportunity to lead the evolution of physical AI across robotics and autonomous vehicles on a global scale.\u201d\nMentee Robotics, which is developing humanoid robots, will continue as an independent unit within Mobileye. Of course, with Shashua as brains and shareholder between the two companies, there will surely be plenty of overlap.\nThe benefits for Mobileye aren\u2019t entirely obvious except that every one seems to be jumping into the humanoid robot game these days. Officially, Mobileye said the acquisition \u201cbroadens the scope of the business with a decisive step toward Physical Artificial Intelligence in general.\u201d Specifically, systems that are designed to understand context and intent as well as act natural with humans and the physical world.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nIn other words, Mobileye, and Shashua, seem to want to move beyond the technology used to allow vehicles to navigate the world and apply it to humanoid robots as well. The company suggests in its announcement it has the funds to get it there, noting that its current automotive revenue pipeline \u2014 driven by its advanced vehicle autonomy and core advanced driver assistance tech \u2014 is $24.5 billion over the next eight years. The company said that pipeline figure is up more than 40% compared to January 2023.\nOf course, the development of humanoid robots that can eventually go into production will be a costly enterprise. Mentee stands to gain considerably as it can tap into Mobileye\u2019s resources, which include advanced AI training infrastructure \u2014 aka compute.\nThe acquisition news comes a day after Mobileye announced another customer win for its next-generation chip built for hands-off advanced driver assistance systems. The company announced Monday that a \u201ctop 10 automaker\u201d struck a deal to buy 9 million of its EyeQ6H-based Surround ADAS systems. Volkswagen Group announced in March it would also use the chip. Mobileye now estimates future delivery of more than 19 million EyeQ6H-based Surround systems.\"\n\nResponse:",
