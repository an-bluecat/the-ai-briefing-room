Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Leaked documents obtained by tech blogger Ed Zitron provide more of a glimpse into OpenAI\u2019s financials \u2014 specifically its revenue and compute costs over the past couple of years.\nZitron reported this week that in 2024, Microsoft received $493.8 million in revenue share payments from OpenAI. In the first three quarters of 2025, that number jumped to $865.8 million, according to documents he viewed.\nOpenAI reportedly shares 20% of its revenue with Microsoft as part of a previous deal where the software giant invested over $13 billion in the powerful AI startup. (Neither the startup nor the people in Redmond have publicly confirmed this percentage.)\nHowever, this is where things get a little sticky, because Microsoft also shares revenue with OpenAI, kicking back about 20% of the revenues from Bing and Azure OpenAI Service, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Bing is powered by OpenAI, and the OpenAI Service sells cloud access to OpenAI\u2019s models to developers and businesses.\nThe source also told TechCrunch that the leaked payments refer to Microsoft\u2019s net revenue share, not the gross revenue share. In other words, they don\u2019t include whatever Microsoft paid to OpenAI from Bing and Azure OpenAI royalties. Microsoft deducts those figures from its internally reported revenue share numbers, according to this person.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t break out how much it makes from Bing and Azure OpenAI in its financial statements, so it\u2019s difficult to estimate how much the tech giant is kicking back.\nNevertheless, the leaked documents provide a window into the hottest company on the private markets today \u2014 and not just how much it makes in revenue, but also how much it\u2019s spending in comparison to that revenue.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nSo, based on that widely reported 20% revenue-share statistic, we can infer that OpenAI\u2019s revenue was at least $2.5 billion in 2024 and $4.33 billion in the first three quarters of 2025 \u2014 but very likely to be more. Previous reports from The Information put OpenAI\u2019s 2024 revenue at around $4 billion, and its revenue from the first half of 2025 at $4.3 billion.\nAltman also recently said OpenAI\u2019s revenue is \u201cwell more\u201d than reports of $13 billion a year, will end the year above $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate (which is a projection, not guidance on actual revenue), and that the company could even hit $100 billion by 2027.\nPer Zitron\u2019s analysis, OpenAI may have spent roughly $3.8 billion on inference in 2024. That spend increased to roughly $8.65 billion in the first nine months of 2025. Inference is the compute used to run a trained AI model to generate responses.\nOpenAI has historically almost exclusively relied on Microsoft Azure to provide compute access, though it has also struck deals with CoreWeave and Oracle, and more recently with AWS and Google Cloud.\nPrevious reports put OpenAI\u2019s entire compute spend at roughly $5.6 billion for 2024 and its \u201ccost of revenue\u201d at $2.5 billion for the first half of 2025.\nA source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that while OpenAI\u2019s training spend is mostly non-cash \u2014 meaning, paid by credits Microsoft awarded OpenAI as part of its investment \u2014 the firm\u2019s inference spend is largely cash. (Training refers to the compute resources needed to initially train a model.)\nWhile not a complete picture, these numbers imply that OpenAI could be spending more on inference costs than it is earning in revenue.\nAnd those implications promise to add to the incessant AI bubble chatter that has seeped into every conversation from New York City to Silicon Valley. If model giant OpenAI really still is in the red running its models, what might this mean for the massive investments at jaw-dropping valuations for the rest of the AI world?\nOpenAI declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment.\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

Konwinski is a Databricks co-founder and the co-founder of the AI research and venture capital firm Laude.\n\u201cIf you talk to PhD students at Berkeley and Stanford in AI right now, they\u2019ll tell you that they\u2019ve read twice as many interesting AI ideas in the last year that were from Chinese companies than American companies,\u201d Konwinski said onstage at the Cerebral Valley AI Summit this week.\nIn addition to investing through Laude, the venture fund he launched last year with NEA veteran Pete Sonsini and Antimatter CEO Andrew Krioukov, Konwinski also runs the Laude Institute, an accelerator that offers grants to researchers.\nMajor AI labs, including OpenAI, Meta, and Anthropic, continue to innovate significantly, yet their innovations remain largely proprietary rather than open source. Moreover, these companies are sucking up top academic talent by offering multimillion-dollar salaries that dwarf what these experts can earn in universities.\nKonwinski argued that for ideas to truly flourish, they need to be freely exchanged and discussed with the larger academic community. He pointed out that generative AI emerged as a direct result of the Transformer architecture, a pivotal training technique introduced in a freely available research paper.\n\u201cThe first nation that makes the next \u2018Transformer architectural level\u2019 breakthrough will have the advantage,\u201d Konwinski said.\nKonwinski argues that in China, the government supports and encourages AI innovation, whether from labs like DeepSeek or Alibaba\u2019s Qwen, to be open sourced, which allows others to build upon them and which, he contends, will inevitably lead to more breakthroughs.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nHe believes this stands in stark contrast to the U.S., where, as he puts it, \u201cthe diffusion of scientists talking to scientists that we always have had in the United States, it\u2019s dried up.\u201d\nKonwinski argues that this trend poses not only a risk to democracy but also a business threat to major U.S. AI labs. \u201cWe\u2019re eating our corn seeds; the fountain is drying up. Fast-forward five years, the big labs are gonna lose too,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure the United States stays number one and open.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nEverything you need to know about the AI chatbot\ndescription2:\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.\n2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.\nOpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI\u2019s transition to a for-profit.\nIn 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it\u2019s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.\nBelow, you\u2019ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year.

In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they\u2019ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it\u2019s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company\u2019s AI \u201cagent\u201d tool, for up to 90 days \u2014 even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator\u2019s.\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.

Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and \u201ctraits\u201d they\u2019d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like \u201cChatty,\u201d \u201cEncouraging,\u201d and \u201cGen Z.\u201d However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it\u2019s possible they went live prematurely.\nFAQs:\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\nWho uses ChatGPT?\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\nYes.\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Gemini and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\nThis story is continually updated with new information.\n\ntitle3:\nTesla releases detailed safety report after Waymo co-CEO called for more data\ndescription3:\nTesla has published the most detailed look at the performance and relative safety of its advanced driver-assistance software, just a few weeks after Waymo\u2019s co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana at TechCrunch Disrupt called on companies to release more data.\nOn a new section of its website, Tesla claims that in North America, owners using the company\u2019s Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software are driving around 5 million miles before a major collision and around 1.5 million miles before a minor collision.\nThat\u2019s a far lower rate than the national average based on statistics provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). That data shows people get in a major collision every 699,000 miles, and a minor one every 229,000, at least according to Tesla\u2019s interpretation.\nTesla has been releasing \u201cvehicle safety reports\u201d on a quarter-by-quarter basis for a while. But those reports have been repeatedly panned for being insufficient. And Tesla has released almost no information about the safety performance of the Robotaxi trial it\u2019s been running in Austin, Texas, this year, which still has employees in the driver\u2019s seat monitoring for safety reasons.\nWaymo, the leading robotaxi company in the U.S. at the moment based on cars deployed and customers served, has published detailed data showing its vehicles are around 5x safer than human drivers, and 12x safer with respect to pedestrians. At last month\u2019s Disrupt conference, Mawakana was asked to name other companies she felt were making roads safer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s on that list, because they\u2019re not telling us what\u2019s happening with their fleets,\u201d said Mawakana, without naming Tesla.\n\u201cI think there is a responsibility, if you\u2019re going to put vehicles on the road, and you\u2019re going to remove the driver from behind the wheel, and you\u2019re going to have someone in some other room observing the fleet who can take over their vehicles, it is incumbent upon you to be transparent about what\u2019s happening,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd if you are not being transparent, then it is my view that you are not doing what is necessary in order to actually earn the right to make the road safer.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Plus, meet the hundreds of startups innovating across every sector. San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nWaymo didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday about whether Mawakana believes Tesla\u2019s new data is sufficient.\nOne of the repeated criticisms of Tesla\u2019s quarterly safety reports is that it focused on Autopilot, a far less advanced driver-assistance system than the Full Self Driving (Supervised) software, or FSD \u2014 which, despite its name, does not make a car fully autonomous. Autopilot was designed to be used on highways, which typically see a lower rate of crashes (when including minor collisions).\nTesla has finally broken out all this data. The new section of Tesla\u2019s website claims that drivers using FSD travel about 2.9 million miles between major collisions, while NHTSA data shows all drivers travel about 505,000 miles per major collision. Tesla claims FSD users drive about 986,000 miles between minor collisions, while NHTSA data shows all drivers travel around 178,000 miles per minor collision.\nTesla is also finally showing how it defines these terms for the first time.\nThe carmaker is using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, specifically 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 563.5. Tesla defines \u201cmajor collisions\u201d as crashes with higher-severity impacts where a vehicle\u2019s airbags \u201cor other non-reversible pyrotechnic restraints\u201d are deployed. The company also says that if FSD was active \u201cat any point within five seconds leading up to a collision event,\u201d then it includes that crash in this dataset.\n\u201cThis calculation ensures that our reported collision rates for FSD (Supervised) capture not only collisions that occur while the system is actively controlling the vehicle, but also scenarios where a driver may disengage the system or where the system aborts on its own shortly before impact,\u201d Tesla says.\nIn its FAQ section, Tesla states that it will update the data every quarter and that it will \u201creflect a rolling twelve-month aggregation of miles and collisions in an effort to remain relevant to recent trends and progress.\u201d The company says it won\u2019t release other information, like injury rates, because it is collecting this data automatically from the vehicles.\n\u201cInstead, Tesla focuses on objective and programmatic metrics such as collision frequency and airbag deployment rates. Airbag deployments serve as a reliable proxy for collision severity,\u201d the company writes.\n\ntitle4:\nFive people plead guilty to helping North Koreans infiltrate US companies as 'remote IT workers'\ndescription4:\nFive people have pleaded guilty to helping North Koreans defraud U.S. companies by posing as remote IT workers, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on Friday.\nThe five people are accused of working as \u201cfacilitators\u201d who helped North Koreans get jobs by providing their own real identities, or false and stolen identities of more than a dozen U.S. nationals. The facilitators also hosted company-provided laptops in their homes across the U.S. to make it look like the North Korean workers lived locally, according to the DOJ press release.\nThese actions affected 136 U.S. companies and netted Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime $2.2 million in revenue, said the DOJ.\nThe latest round of guilty pleas is part of a years-long effort by American authorities to disrupt North Korea\u2019s ability to make money from cybercrime. For years, North Korea has successfully infiltrated hundreds of Western companies posing as remote IT workers \u2014 as well as investors and recruiters \u2014 as part of a scheme to fund its internationally sanctioned nuclear weapons program. In recent years, the U.S. government has fought back, indicting people involved in the scheme, and imposing sanctions on international fraud networks.\n\u201cThese prosecutions make one point clear: the United States will not permit [North Korea] to bankroll its weapons programs by preying on American companies and workers,\u201d U.S. Attorney Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones said in a press release. \u201cWe will keep working with our partners across the Justice Department to uncover these schemes, recover stolen funds, and pursue every individual who enables North Korea\u2019s operations.\u201d\nThree of the people \u2014 U.S. nationals Audricus Phagnasay, Jason Salazar, and Alexander Paul Travis \u2014 each pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy.\nProsecutors accused the three of helping North Koreans posing as legitimate IT workers, whom they knew worked outside of the United States, to use their own identities to obtain employment, helped them remotely access their company-issued laptops set up in their homes, and also helped the North Koreans pass vetting procedures, such as drug tests.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

The scheme saw U.S. companies pay around $1.28 million in salaries, most of which was sent to the North Korean IT workers overseas, per the DOJ.\nThe fourth U.S. national who pleaded guilty is Erick Ntekereze Prince, who ran a company called Taggcar, which supplied to U.S. companies allegedly \u201ccertified\u201d IT workers but whom he knew worked outside of the country and were using stolen or fake identities. Prince also hosted laptops with remote access software at several residences in Florida, and earned more than $89,000 for his work, the DOJ said.\nAnother participant in the scheme who pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy and another count of aggravated identity theft is Ukrainian national Oleksandr Didenko, who prosecutors accuse of stealing U.S. citizens\u2019 identities and selling them to North Koreans so they could get jobs at more than 40 U.S. companies.\nAccording to the press release, Didenko earned hundreds of thousands of dollars for this service. Didenko agreed to forfeit $1.4 million as part of his guilty plea.\nThe DOJ also announced that it had frozen and seized more than $15 million in cryptocurrency stolen in 2023 by North Korean hackers from several crypto platforms.\nCrypto companies, exchanges, and blockchain projects, have become one of the favorite targets for North Korean hackers, who stole more than $650 million in crypto in 2024, and more than $2 billion so far this year.\"\n\nResponse:",
