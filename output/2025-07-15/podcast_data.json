Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday July 16), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon's Kuiper satellites to get boost from rival SpaceX\ndescription0:\nAmazon\u2019s race to challenge SpaceX in orbit is getting a helping hand from its chief competitor: SpaceX, which will launch the next batch of Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper internet satellites skyward on Wednesday.\nA flock of 24 Kuiper internet satellites will ride aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket before dawn. The mission, dubbed KF-01, has a 27-minute launch window that opens at 2:18 a.m. ET and will lift off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Once complete, it will bring the total number of Kuiper satellites on orbit to 78. Amazon ultimately plans to deploy more than 3,200 spacecraft in its first-generation constellation in low Earth orbit, aiming to stake a serious claim in the satellite internet market \u2014 a market that is currently dominated by Starlink\u2019s network of roughly 8,000 satellites.\nWhile Kuiper and SpaceX may make for strange bedfellows, Jeff Bezos\u2019 Amazon inked a three-launch deal with SpaceX back in December 2023. That agreement came scarcely two months after the e-commerce giant faced a lawsuit from shareholders over an earlier decision not to consider SpaceX when it doled out its first round of lucrative launch contracts, even though the Falcon 9 is the most reliable rocket flying today.\nThe catch is, at least half of Kuiper\u2019s initial constellation must be deployed by the end of July 2026, per its license from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. The clock is ticking: among the other selected launch providers \u2014 United Launch Alliance (ULA), Arianespace, and Blue Origin \u2014 only ULA has an operational rocket available to carry satellites to orbit. ULA launched the first two batches of Kuiper satellites; the first batch launched in April.\nBlue Origin, Bezos\u2019 other company, will eventually carry Kuiper satellites on its massive New Glenn rocket, but it has only flown once so far, and it did not manage to recover the booster. The second launch is currently scheduled for August 15.\n\ntitle1:\nMeta fixes bug that could leak users' AI prompts and generated content\ndescription1:\nMeta has fixed a security bug that allowed Meta AI chatbot users to access and view the private prompts and AI-generated responses of other users.\nSandeep Hodkasia, the founder of security testing firm AppSecure, exclusively told TechCrunch that Meta paid him $10,000 in a bug bounty reward for privately disclosing the bug he filed on December 26, 2024.\nMeta deployed a fix on January 24, 2025, said Hodkasia, and found no evidence that the bug was maliciously exploited.\nHodkasia told TechCrunch that he identified the bug after examining how Meta AI allows its logged-in users to edit their AI prompts to regenerate text and images. He discovered that when a user edits their prompt, Meta\u2019s back-end servers assign the prompt and its AI-generated response a unique number. By analyzing the network traffic in his browser while editing an AI prompt, Hodkasia found he could change that unique number and Meta\u2019s servers would return a prompt and AI-generated response of someone else entirely.\nThe bug meant that Meta\u2019s servers were not properly checking to ensure that the user requesting the prompt and its response was authorized to see it. Hodkasia said the prompt numbers generated by Meta\u2019s servers were \u201ceasily guessable,\u201d potentially allowing a malicious actor to scrape users\u2019 original prompts by rapidly changing prompt numbers using automated tools.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Meta confirmed it fixed the bug in January and that the company \u201cfound no evidence of abuse and rewarded the researcher,\u201d Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels told TechCrunch.\nNews of the bug comes at a time when tech giants are scrambling to launch and refine their AI products, despite many security and privacy risks associated with their use.\nMeta AI\u2019s stand-alone app, which debuted earlier this year to compete with rival apps like ChatGPT, launched to a rocky start after some users inadvertently publicly shared what they thought were private conversations with the chatbot.\n\ntitle2:\nGoogle Discover adds AI summaries, threatening publishers with further traffic declines\ndescription2:\nAs publishers fret about decreased traffic from Google, the search giant has begun rolling out AI summaries in Discover, the main news feed inside Google\u2019s search app on iOS and Android. Now, instead of seeing a headline from a major publication, users will see multiple news publishers\u2019 logos in the top-left corner, followed by an AI-generated summary that cites those sources.\nThe app warns that these summaries are generated with AI, \u201cwhich can make mistakes.\u201d\nImage Credits:Google\nThe feature is not yet appearing for all news stories within the Google app. In tests, TechCrunch was able to view the AI summaries firsthand across both iOS and Android apps in the U.S.\nReached for comment, a Google spokesperson confirmed this is not a test, but actually a U.S. launch. The feature will appear on iOS and Android in the U.S., with a focus on trending lifestyle topics like sports and entertainment. Google also noted the feature will make it easier for people to decide what pages they want to visit.\nIn addition to the summaries, Google has been trying out other ways to present the news displayed in Discover. Though not flagged as powered by AI, some stories will include a set of bullet points below the headline or will be grouped with similar news.\nFor instance, a story about President Trump\u2019s Ukraine deal also included links to other stories about Trump\u2019s latest actions. Meanwhile, a story from The Washington Post about ICE was followed by bullet points that summarized the story\u2019s content.\nImage Credits:Google\nThe update to the search app comes as a number of publishers have been experimenting with AI on their own sites, including The Wall Street Journal, Yahoo, Bloomberg, USA Today, and others. Startups, too, have gotten in on the action, as with Particle, a news reader that uses AI to not only summarize stories but also allow users to see different sides or ask follow-up questions to better understand the topic covered.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nDespite these trials, there\u2019s significant concern in the publishing industry about how the shift to AI is impacting website traffic and referrals. With features like Google\u2019s AI Overviews and AI Mode, users no longer have to visit a website directly to get answers to their search queries \u2014 it can be summarized for them automatically or shared in a chatbot-style interface. Outside of Google, this same trend is seen across other AI apps, like ChatGPT or Perplexity.\nRecently, Google tried to appease publishers with the launch of Offerwall, a feature that allows publishers to generate revenue beyond the more traffic-dependent options, like ads. With Offerwall, publishers who use Google Ad Manager can try out different methods to provide access to their content, like micropayments or having users take surveys, sign up for newsletters, watch ads, and more.\nBut for many publishers, these tools are coming too late, as traffic is already in a steep decline.\nA story by The Economist this week noted that worldwide search traffic fell by 15% year-over-year as of June, citing data from market intelligence company Similarweb.\nEarlier data from the firm also found that the number of news searches on the web that result in no click-throughs to news websites had grown from 56% in May 2024, when AI Overviews launched, to nearly 69% as of May 2025. Organic traffic also declined, dropping from over 2.3 billion visits at its peak in mid-2024 to fewer than 1.7 billion, it noted.\nAmid this shift, Google Discover still remained a source for clicks, even as traffic from Google Search declined. But that may no longer be the case if the AI summaries roll out more broadly within the Google app.\nUpdated after publication with Google\u2019s comment confirming it\u2019s a U.S. launch.\n\ntitle3:\nA former OpenAI engineer describes what it\u2019s really like to work there\ndescription3:\nThree weeks ago, an engineer named Calvin French-Owen, who worked on one of OpenAI\u2019s most promising new products, resigned from the company.\nHe just published a fascinating blog post on what it was like to work there for a year, including the sleepless sprint to build Codex. That\u2019s OpenAI\u2019s new coding agent that competes with tools like Cursor and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Code.\nFrench-Owen said he didn\u2019t leave because of any \u201cdrama,\u201d but because he wants to get back to being a startup founder. He was a co-founder of customer data startup Segment, which was bought by Twilio in 2020 for $3.2 billion.\nSome of what he revealed about the OpenAI culture would surprise no one, but other observations combat some misconceptions about the company. (He could not be immediately reached for comment.)\nFast growth: OpenAI grew from 1,000 to 3,000 people in the year he was there, he wrote.\nThe LLM model maker certainly has reasons for such hiring. It is the fastest-growing consumer product ever, and its competitors are also growing fast. In March, it said that ChatGPT had over 500 million active users and climbing quickly.\nChaos: \u201cEverything breaks when you scale that quickly: how to communicate as a company, the reporting structures, how to ship product, how to manage and organize people, the hiring processes, etc.,\u201d French-Owen wrote.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nLike a small startup, people there are still empowered to act on their ideas with little to no red tape. But that also means that multiple teams are duplicating efforts. \u201cI must\u2019ve seen half a dozen libraries for things like queue management or agent loops,\u201d he offered as examples.\nCoding skill varies, too, from seasoned Google engineers who write code that can handle a billion users, to newly minted PhDs who do not. This, coupled with the flexible Python language, means that the central code repository, aka \u201cthe back-end monolith,\u201d is \u201ca bit of a dumping ground,\u201d he described.\nStuff frequently breaks or can take excessive time to run. But top engineering managers are aware of this and are working on improvements, he wrote.\n\u201cLaunching spirit\u201d: OpenAI doesn\u2019t seem to know yet that it\u2019s a giant company, right down to running entirely on Slack. It feels very much like move-fast-and-break-things Meta in its early Facebook years, he observed. The company is also full of hires from Meta.\nFrench-Owen described how his senior team of around eight engineers, four researchers, two designers, two go-to-market staff, and a product manager built and launched Codex in only seven weeks, start to finish, with almost no sleep.\nBut launching it was magic. Just by turning it on, they got users. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a product get so much immediate uptick just from appearing in a left-hand sidebar, but that\u2019s the power of ChatGPT.\u201d\nSecretive fishbowl: ChatGPT is a highly scrutinized company. This led to a culture of secrecy in an attempt to clamp down on leaks to the public. At the same time, the company watches X. If a post goes viral there, OpenAI will see it and, possibly, respond to it. \u201cA friend of mine joked, \u2018this company runs on twitter vibes,\u2019\u201d he wrote.\nBiggest misconception: French-Owen implied that the biggest misconception about OpenAI is that it isn\u2019t as concerned about safety as it should be. Certainly a lot of AI safety folks, including former OpenAI employees, have criticized its processes.\nWhile there are doomsayers worrying about theoretic risks to humanity, internally there\u2019s more focus on practical safety like \u201chate speech, abuse, manipulating political biases, crafting bio-weapons, self-harm, prompt injection,\u201d he wrote.\nOpenAI isn\u2019t ignoring the long-term potential impacts, he wrote. There are researchers looking at them, and it\u2019s aware that hundreds of millions of people are using its LLMs today for everything from medical advice to therapy.\nGovernments are watching. Competitors are watching (and OpenAI is watching competitors in return). \u201cThe stakes feel really high.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nAV startup Pronto.ai acquires off-road autonomous vehicle rival SafeAI\ndescription4:\nThe Venn diagram of engineers who know a little bit about AI, self-driving, and mining has a small intersection. Pronto.ai CEO Anthony Levandowski wants as many of those people as possible. And an acquisition is helping him achieve that goal.\nThe San Francisco-based startup, which has developed a self-driving system designed for haulage trucks and other off-road vehicles used at construction and mining sites, has acquired competitor SafeAI, TechCrunch has learned.\nTerms of the deal have not been disclosed. However, Levandowski said the acquisition is a talent and technology play. The bulk of the small 12-person startup\u2019s engineering team and its IP will come over to Pronto. A source familiar with the deal said the SafeAI acquisition price was in \u201cthe millions.\u201d\n\u201cIn the autonomous haulage system space, there\u2019s really kind of two players \u2014 it\u2019s SafeAI and us,\u201d Levandowski told TechCrunch in a recent interview, adding that SafeAI and Pronto have taken different approaches to the market. \u201cWe\u2019ve been growing a ton and needed to add more people and resources to the team, so it made sense to purchase them \u2026 have more wood behind fewer arrows so that we could grow faster.\u201d\nPronto, which was co-founded with Ognen Stojanovski in 2018, uses advanced sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to operate haul trucks autonomously. Pronto also uses Pollen Mobile, a peer-to-peer open source mobile data network the startup launched in 2022 that allows it to exchange data anonymously and at high speeds without relying on legacy carriers. Pollen is used to support sites with little to no connectivity.\nPronto has kept its team fairly lean at about 40 people. The SafeAI acquisition will help Pronto serve more customers, including internationally, Levandowski said. Last year, Pronto extended a partnership with Heidelberg Materials North America, one of the largest build materials and cement producers in the world, following a pilot program at the company\u2019s Bridgeport Quarry in Texas. Pronto\u2019s technology is integrated into Komatsu haulage trucks, which operates autonomously at the site.\nEarlier this year, Pronto announced an agreement with Heidelberg to deploy more than 100 autonomous trucks and expand its team in Brazil.\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Pronto is known for its camera-only approach. SafeAI, which was founded in 2017 and raised $38 million in a Series B round of funding three years ago, uses multiple sensors, on-vehicle cameras, radar, and lidar. Pronto plans to offer the multi-sensor approach as well as use SafeAI\u2019s safety framework that has been ASIL D-certified, the highest safety integrity level in the industry.\"\n\nResponse:",
