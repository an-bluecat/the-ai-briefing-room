He has made great strides toward that goal, growing the product to 800 million weekly active users. Now Turley wants to take an even bigger swing: transforming ChatGPT into a new type of operating system full of third-party apps.\nI sat down with Turley this week on the outskirts of San Francisco\u2019s Fort Mason, a former U.S. military post where OpenAI held its third annual developer conference, to discuss how he\u2019s thinking about ChatGPT\u2019s future. You can find a transcript of our conversation at the bottom of this article.\nTo turn ChatGPT into an operating system, Turley tells me he\u2019s drawing inspiration from web browsers. Over the last decade, browsers have emerged as a new kind of operating system \u2014 not in the literal sense like macOS or Windows \u2014 because they\u2019ve become the main place people work on computers thanks to a variety of web applications. Turley sees ChatGPT evolving in a similar way: a platform that could change how people interact with software.\nOpenAI is reportedly developing a browser too. Turley doesn\u2019t confirm or deny this, but he does say browsers are \u201creally interesting.\u201d The company is also working with Jony Ive and a team of longtime Apple designers on a family of hardware devices. Given these efforts, it\u2019s easy to see how a ChatGPT operating system full of apps could become a central component of OpenAI\u2019s consumer ecosystem.\nOpenAI has been chasing this idea for a while. In 2023, the company launched an array of \u201cAI app store\u201d efforts such as ChatGPT plugins and the GPT Store. Those products didn\u2019t exactly take off, but OpenAI seems to have a better approach this time around.\nThe launch of apps aligns with OpenAI\u2019s desire to turn ChatGPT into an e-commerce destination. Apps from Expedia, DoorDash, and Uber could lead to more transactions in ChatGPT, something OpenAI can now facilitate and capture some of the revenue from. Having a product featured in ChatGPT could be a major source of business for both third parties and OpenAI.\nThis might also be OpenAI\u2019s most compelling pitch to developers yet. Third parties can now reach ChatGPT\u2019s 800 million users during their everyday conversations. Apps are part of ChatGPT\u2019s core experience, rather than in a separate store of widgets. Developers can also build more interactive experiences in ChatGPT, beyond just chatbots connected to their company\u2019s data.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nHowever, the business of running an operating system also comes with lots of messy problems, such as how to promote certain apps over others. Turley says OpenAI isn\u2019t ruling out letting some companies pay for their apps to have priority placement in ChatGPT, but the company is figuring out how to do this without hurting the user experience.\nThird-party developers likely also want access to ChatGPT user data. In a set of guidelines, OpenAI says app developers must \u201cgather only the minimum data required to perform the tool\u2019s function,\u201d but it\u2019s unclear what that means in practice. Turley says OpenAI may build out new features \u2014 such as a partitioned memory in ChatGPT \u2014 that could let users give fine-grained data access to developers.\nOne standout comment from our conversation was how Turley views ChatGPT as the \u201cdelivery vehicle\u201d for OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit mission: to develop and distribute artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 highly autonomous AI systems \u2014 in a way that benefits humanity. Some OpenAI researchers worry that the company\u2019s consumer business could overpower its nonprofit mission. But according to Turley, ChatGPT is how OpenAI will distribute AGI to the masses. How\u2019s that for a spin?\nHere\u2019s my conversation with Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, which has been edited for clarity and brevity.\nOpenAI\u2019s Head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley. Image Credits:OpenAI\nHow are you thinking about ChatGPT as a platform for other companies?\nI think we\u2019re gonna look back at ChatGPT in a couple years and feel like the current product is in the command line era. It\u2019s really powerful, but it\u2019s lacking something very important, which is affordances.\nIn the classic operating system world, that\u2019s obvious. We prefer going to Mac or Windows and opening applications versus remembering all the commands. It\u2019s kind of bonkers to me that we\u2019ve scaled the product to 800 million weekly active users with the form factor we have. This is a weird and hard [way] to grow category, and yet it\u2019s growing like crazy.\nThe evolution we\u2019re trying to make over the next few years is one where ChatGPT itself is more like an operating system where you can come and use applications. If you want to write, there\u2019s an app for that. If you want to code, there\u2019s an app for that. If you want to interact with goods and services, there are applications for you.\nBut we can\u2019t build everything ourselves. We\u2019re not going to have a music streaming service, or replicate Coursera\u2019s catalog of educational materials. We\u2019re not going to get into the business that Expedia and Booking.com are in. And for that reason, it makes sense to partner.\nThere\u2019s also a whole generation of apps that people are going to build that wouldn\u2019t have been possible previously. The Ubers of the world only exist because of the mobile platform, and I\u2019m really excited about what those might be for ChatGPT.\nWe also want to give developers, who have been with us since the beginning, access to ChatGPT\u2019s 800 million weekly users. If they\u2019re able to enhance ChatGPT and build real businesses on top of that, it creates more winners in the ecosystem.\nWhere do you draw inspiration from when building ChatGPT?\nYou can\u2019t go to one spot. I often tell job candidates they need to have first principles thinking, and if they\u2019re gonna try to run a playbook they saw at Meta or Google, you\u2019re actually gonna run out of competitors to copy. When it comes to [ChatGPT] or Sora, there\u2019s just zero precedent. So you kind of have to get your analogies from different places.\nI think browsers are really interesting because, in some ways, they\u2019ve become the operating system in the last 10 years. How many of us actually use desktop apps? You might use Excel or PowerPoint, but most of what we do actually happens in the browser via application-like things.\nI also spent some time looking at the early ads for the [Apple] PowerBook. It\u2019s kind of like ChatGPT where it was this appliance that nobody quite knew everything you could do with it. The ads were literally like \u201cIt\u2019s a calculator, it\u2019s an alarm clock.\u201d\nSo there isn\u2019t a single thing you can look at, but it behooves us to learn from history. If you just look at the last 10 years, there might not be the perfect analogous thing.\nYou mentioned browsers and devices there. How are you thinking about expanding ChatGPT into those form factors?\nOpenAI is the kind of place where you dream big. One category we have covered is productivity, which is effectively ChatGPT. But there are so many other product categories to be built, and they\u2019re all going to change with AI. Entertainment is one, which is why I\u2019m excited about Sora. Social media is another one. Obviously, hardware and access points to the internet are interesting too.\nYou should really think about what we\u2019re building as a family of products and applications that are tied together by your account, personalization, and identity layer. I\u2019m really excited that we\u2019re not boxing ourselves in. Even if we were just the ChatGPT company, there would be infinite things to build, but our ambition on what we can do for people just goes way beyond that.\nI\u2019m interested in hearing how you think the consumer business of OpenAI fits into the nonprofit mission. I\u2019ve heard some people say the consumer business funds the mission. How do you see it?\nThe OpenAI I joined was a research lab that might ship a demo or two. In fact, my job description at the time was framed to me as \u201chelping commercialize OpenAI technology\u201d \u2014 very open ended. At that time, the product existed to bring the research to life so that people actually get it. I think that was true and still is true, as you can see with Sora. The best way to start a grounded discourse on the profoundness of a technology is to ship something.\nThen we moved from that framing to, okay, maybe the product is more than that. Maybe the product is actually the way we fund the mission. It became evident at some point, even before I got to OpenAI, that this is all going to be very expensive.\nBut after ChatGPT, we started talking about it a bit differently. Our mission is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity, and reaches people. If you combine that with the insight that AGI is probably not this single moment in time, but rather a gradual thing, you have to think of product as the delivery vehicle of the mission. It\u2019s the way you actually benefit people in practice.\nIf you look at what these 800 million people are doing every week, ChatGPT is helping them achieve their goals. I don\u2019t know if you saw the guy in the keynote who taught himself to code at 89. That\u2019s insane to me. I talk to ChatGPT users who help their autistic kids by modeling social interactions. I talk to people who are entirely self-taught in a language based on what they do with ChatGPT. Like, that is the mission.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to talk about the consumer business as a funding vehicle. Rather, it\u2019s the expression. That is one way in which OpenAI has evolved, to me at least, since I\u2019ve joined.\nLet\u2019s dive deeper into the apps that were announced today. OpenAI has said that third parties can only take the \u201cminimum amount of data\u201d necessary to run an app in ChatGPT. How are you thinking about user privacy?\nFrom day one, we\u2019re going to ask developers to disclose to users what information they\u2019re requesting. We\u2019re also only going to let [apps] go live if they are reasonable in the data that they request. We published our developer guidelines [at launch] so people won\u2019t be surprised when we reject their app because it doesn\u2019t comply with our stance on privacy.\nOver the next month, we want to build ways for users to give fine-grained access to developers. I think Apple has done a phenomenal job with this, where you can share data just this time, or all the time, etc.\nTo do that well, we might need some concept of a partitioned memory in ChatGPT, which we\u2019re still thinking through. But we\u2019re really excited about the idea because you might want to keep certain conversations, like health, separate from others, such as music. Users may want to share one, but not the other, with an app. So we\u2019re going to have a lot more to share soon, because it\u2019s actually a combined research and engineering challenge to do this well.\nThe thing that\u2019s uncompromisable for us is transparency. We want users, at all points, to understand what data might be going to a third party, but the controls will come over time as we build them out.\nDoorDash and Instacart are two companies that will have apps in ChatGPT soon enough. If I want to order some snacks, how will ChatGPT know which one to go to?\nThis is the classic question. The best way to start is you show them both. If you\u2019ve used one of them before, we\u2019ll prioritize that one. If you\u2019ve used both, we\u2019ll ask which one you prefer. We could get more sophisticated over time. You could imagine one of these apps being much higher quality than another. Maybe there would be reason to prioritize one over the other.\nWe have multiple partners in the same product categories. I think the most graceful and respectful way to handle that is to serve both apps.\nAre you thinking about letting companies pay for their apps to have preferential spot placement in ChatGPT?\nThis is one of the things we\u2019re hoping to do some discovery on with developers. There\u2019s this trade-off. You could try to figure it all out in advance, and roll it out with the announcement, but that probably means you didn\u2019t talk to a lot of people. Or you could delay it, which means everyone\u2019s asking questions and doesn\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen, but it gives us the ability to actually engage.\nWe chose the latter just because we know that building this ecosystem is going to be a long game. It\u2019s not going to happen on day one, and therefore it\u2019s better to be thoughtful on what sort of distribution mechanisms are and aren\u2019t fair game.\nAt the end of the day, we want a great user experience. So if that would lead to apps [surfacing] that are irrelevant to the user, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d like it. If this was a lever that helped us prioritize apps that are really serious because they\u2019re clearly trying to invest in exposure, it could be a good thing. We have no point of view as of today. It\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s come up with different partners.\n\ntitle1:\nEven after Stargate, Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD, OpenAI has more big deals coming soon, Sam Altman says\ndescription1:\nAt nearly the same moment as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was expressing surprise over OpenAI\u2019s multibillion-dollar deal with competitor AMD \u2014 shortly after his company agreed to invest up to $100 billion into the AI model maker \u2014 Sam Altman was saying that more such deals are in the works.\nHuang appeared on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on Wednesday. When asked if he knew about the AMD deal before it was announced, he answered, \u201cNot really.\u201d\nAs TechCrunch previously reported, OpenAI\u2019s deal with AMD is unusual. AMD has agreed to grant OpenAI large tranches of AMD stock \u2014 up to 10% of the company over a period of years contingent on factors like increases in stock price. In exchange, OpenAI will use and help develop the chipmaker\u2019s next-generation AI GPUs chips. This makes OpenAI a shareholder in AMD.\nNvidia\u2019s deal is the reverse. Nvidia has invested in the AI model-making startup, making it a shareholder in OpenAI.\nWhile OpenAI has been using Nvidia gear for years through cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle OCI, and CoreWeave, \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re going to sell directly to them,\u201d Huang explained. He added that his company would still continue to supply gear to the cloud makers, too.\nThese direct sales, which include AI gear beyond GPUs like systems and networking, are intended to \u201cprepare\u201d OpenAI for the day when it is its own \u201cself-hosted hyperscaler,\u201d Huang said. In other words, when it\u2019s using its own data centers.\nBut Huang admits that OpenAI doesn\u2019t \u201chave the money yet\u201d to pay for all of this gear. He estimated that each gigawatt of AI data center will cost OpenAI \u201c$50 to $60 billion,\u201d to cover everything from the land and power to the servers and equipment.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nSo far, in 2025, OpenAI has commissioned 10 gigawatts\u2019 worth of U.S. facilities through its $500 billion Stargate deal with partners Oracle and SoftBank. (Plus, it penned a $300 billion cloud deal with Oracle.)\nIts partnership with Nvidia was for at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. Its partnership with AMD was for 6 gigawatts. Plus its \u201cStargate UK\u201d partnership involves expanding data centers in the U.K., and it has other European commitments. By some estimates, OpenAI has this year inked $1 trillion worth of such deals.\nSimilar to the AMD deal, Nvidia\u2019s deal has been criticized for being \u201ccircular,\u201d Bloomberg reported. The critics say Nvidia is essentially underwriting OpenAI\u2019s purchases, getting the AI startup\u2019s stock for its efforts.\nAltman to the world: Expect more\nAs Huang was dissecting OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure needs on CNBC, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s interview with Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s a16z Podcast dropped.\nDuring the podcast, a16z co-founder Ben Horowitz told Altman that he\u2019s \u201cvery impressed by deal structure improvement,\u201d referring to these most recent deals. Andreessen Horowitz is an OpenAI investor, so it would be shocking if he wasn\u2019t impressed. OpenAI has found a way to potentially obtain billions of dollars of equipment on someone else\u2019s dime. Repeatedly.\nWhen asked about these recent deals, Altman said, \u201cYou should expect much more from us in the coming months.\u201d\nAltman sees OpenAI\u2019s future models and upcoming other products as so much more capable, thereby fueling so much more demand, that \u201cwe have decided that it is time to go make a very aggressive infrastructure bet,\u201d he explained.\nThe problem is that OpenAI\u2019s revenue today is currently nowhere near a $1 trillion, though it is, by all accounts, growing rapidly, reportedly hitting $4.5 billion in the first half of 2025.\nYet Altman obviously believes that eventually all of this investment will pay for itself. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more confident in the research road map in front of us and also the economic value that will come from using those [future] models.\u201d\nBut, he said, OpenAI can\u2019t get to all of that economic lushness on its own.\n\u201cTo make the bet at this scale, we kind of need the whole industry, or big chunk of the industry, to support it. And this is from the level of electrons to model distribution and all the stuff in between, which is a lot. So we\u2019re going to partner with a lot of people,\u201d Altman said, with more deals expected in the coming months.\nSo stand by, tech industry. OpenAI is still wheeling and dealing.\n\ntitle2:\nZendesk says its new AI agent can solve 80% of support issues\ndescription2:\nZendesk announced Wednesday at its AI summit a string of LLM-driven products meant to reshape the company\u2019s reliance on human technicians.\nThe center of the new features is an autonomous support agent that Zendesk believes will solve 80% of support issues without human intervention. That system will be supplemented by a co-pilot agent, which will assist human technicians with the remaining 20% of issues, as well as an admin-layer agent, a voice-based agent, and an analytics agent.\nAccording to Shashi Upadhyay, Zendesk\u2019s president of Product, Engineering and AI, the new agents are part of a broader change in the support industry, as AI replaces much of the work that was previously done by humans.\n\u201cThe world\u2019s going to shift from software that\u2019s built for human users, to a system where AI actually does most of the work,\u201d Upadhyay told TechCrunch.\nIndependent benchmarks suggest that contemporary AI models are capable of taking on the work. TAU-bench, which was designed to measure a model\u2019s tool-calling ability, includes a scenario in which models have to process a returned product \u2014 a close analogue to many support tasks. The current leader, Claude Sonnet 4.5, solves 85% of issues on the test.\nAfter a chaotic investor fight in 2022, Zendesk has made a string of AI acquisitions that laid the groundwork for the current shift. The analytics agent launching today is built directly on the company\u2019s Hyperarc acquisition, which was completed in July. Earlier AI acquisitions include the QA and agentic service system Klaus (acquired in February 2024) and the automation platform Ultimate (acquired the following March).\nZendesk has previewed the new system with existing customers, and Upadhyay says the results have been promising.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Companies from Airbnb to Regal Theaters have already experimented with in-house chatbot support, often contracting directly with foundation model labs. But those systems typically deal with information retrieval rather than more complex troubleshooting or taking self-directed action.\nIf the new push for AI-based support is successful, the economic implications would be significant. Zendesk\u2019s Resolution Platform already supports nearly 20,000 customers, resolving 4.6 billion tickets each year. Beyond Zendesk, the U.S. employs 2.4 million customer service representatives \u2014 with far larger workforces in other countries.\n\ntitle3:\nSora's downloads in its first week was nearly as big as ChatGPT's launch\ndescription3:\nAfter OpenAI\u2019s video-generating app Sora surged to the No. 1 position on the U.S. App Store, it has now, technically, experienced a bigger first week than ChatGPT on iOS, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures. Its estimates show that Sora saw 627,000 iOS downloads in its first seven days of availability, compared with ChatGPT\u2019s 606,000 iOS downloads during its first week.\nThis isn\u2019t the fairest comparison, however, because ChatGPT was available only in the U.S. during its first week, while Sora is currently offered in the U.S. and Canada at launch. Still, Appfigures says that Canada contributed about 45,000 installs, so the Sora launch was about 96% of ChatGPT\u2019s launch, if the data had been based on the U.S. numbers only.\nThis level of consumer adoption is worth noting because Sora remains an invite-only app, while ChatGPT was more publicly available at launch. That makes Sora\u2019s performance more impressive.\nDuring its first day, Sora saw 56,000 app installs in short order, bumping the app to become the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store. By Friday, October 3, it reached No. 1. That surge had already put Sora\u2019s debut ahead of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and put it on par with xAI\u2019s Grok launch.\nA quick scan of social media provides plenty of anecdotes that support Appfigures\u2019 data. Sora videos, which uses the new Sora 2 video model and gives users the ability to generate realistic deepfakes, seem to be everywhere.

It has since seen between lows of 84,400 daily installs (on October 6) and 98,500 daily installs (on October 4).\nWhile that\u2019s not quite as high as earlier in the week, it\u2019s still decent numbers for an app that not everyone can yet use.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon Pharmacy is launching vending machines for prescription drugs\ndescription4:\nAmazon announced on Wednesday that it\u2019s debuting prescription vending machines at its One Medical clinics.
