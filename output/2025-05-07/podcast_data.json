Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure.

So it \u201ccaptures hundreds of subtle signals about each payment\u201d that other models would miss, she said.\nOne use case is improved fraud detection. Stripe\u2019s previous models \u201cgradually\u201d reduced card-testing attacks by 80% over two years. Card-testing attacks are a type of fraudulent activity in which someone tries to determine whether stolen card information is valid so that they can use it to make purchases.\nThe company claims that its new foundation model increased its detection rate for such attacks on large businesses \u201cby 64% practically overnight.\u201d\nShe added, \u201cPreviously, we couldn\u2019t take advantage of our vast data. Now we can.\u201d\nStripe, of course, isn\u2019t the only fintech to have built a model using AI for fraud detection. Just one example is Sardine, which describes itself as an AI risk platform for fraud, compliance, and credit underwriting, in February raised a $70 million Series C funding round led by Activant Capital.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nIn an interview, Will Gaybrick, Stripe\u2019s president of product and business, told TechCrunch that Stripe\u2019s generalized model is via self-supervised learning, and thus discovers its own features.\n\u201cWe have found over and over and over again in machine learning, generalized models outperform,\u201d he said. \u201cA big part of that is agility. It just performs better and adapts better to changes in fraud patterns.\nStripe also announced on Wednesday its intent to bring stablecoin-backed, multicurrency cards to businesses by partnering with other startups like Ramp, Squads, and Airtm. With such cards, businesses across multiple countries will be able to \u201coperate in the same currency for the first time,\u201d the companies claim.\nThe move comes just three months after Stripe completed its acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge.\nWith Orchestration, Stripe said it can better help businesses set up, manage, and optimize performance across multiple payment providers from its dashboard \u2014 whether or not they use Stripe as a payment processor.\nStripe also used the event to name numerous AI companies that use its billing product, including Windsurf, OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Perplexity, and ElevenLabs.\nMore recently, according to Vivek Sharma, Stripe\u2019s head of revenue automation, Nvidia migrated its \u201centire subscriber base\u201d to Stripe Billing in six weeks \u2014 a process that the fintech claims typically takes many months for a business to complete and marked the \u201cfastest-ever migration to Stripe Billing.\u201d (Nvidia was already a customer of Stripe Payments.)\nOther announcements by Stripe on Wednesday included the following:\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI and the FDA are reportedly discussing AI for drug evaluations\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI has met with officials from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the agency\u2019s use of AI to speed up drug evaluations, Wired reported on Wednesday.\nAccording to the report, OpenAI and the FDA have discussed a project called cderGPT, which seems to be an AI tool for the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE). The CDE regulates over-the-counter and prescription drugs in the U.S. Associates from Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE have reportedly been part of the talks as well.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for drug development processes to take more than a decade to complete. OpenAI\u2019s work with the FDA aims to accelerate a small portion of that timeline, toward the end, per Wired. AI has long been touted as a potential accelerant that could be used throughout drug development, making some notoriously slow steps more efficient. That said, there are unanswered questions around how to control for the unreliability of AI models.\n\ntitle2:\nTesla's 'Robotaxi' and 'Cybercab' trademarks hit roadblocks ahead of June launch\ndescription2:\nTesla\u2019s attempt to trademark the term \u201cRobotaxi\u201d in reference to its vehicles has been refused by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for being too generic, according to a new filing. Another application by Tesla to trademark the term \u201cRobotaxi\u201d for its upcoming ride-hailing service is still under examination by the office.\nIn addition, applications from Tesla for the trademark on the term \u201cCybercab\u201d have been halted due to other companies pursuing similar \u201cCyber\u201d trademarks. That includes one company that has applied for numerous trademarks related to aftermarket Cybertruck accessories.\nThe USPTO issued Tuesday what\u2019s known as a \u201cnonfinal office action\u201d on the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d trademark application, which means Tesla has three months to file a response or the office will abandon the application. A trademark lawyer representing Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTesla applied for the trademarks in October 2024 on the same day that it revealed the Cybercab, the purpose-built electric car that it hopes to one day use in its planned autonomous ride-hailing service. Tesla also submitted two similar trademark applications October 10 for the term \u201cRobobus,\u201d which are still under examination.\nThe trademark that was refused was assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14. Tesla said it would use the word in reference to \u201c[l]and vehicles; electric vehicles, namely automobiles; automobiles; and structural parts therefor,\u201d according to the original application.\nWhile the USPTO examiner found there were no conflicting trademarks in existence, it refused the application because it was \u201cmerely descriptive.\u201d The examiner wrote that the term \u201cRobotaxi\u201d is \u201cused to describe similar goods and services by other companies.\u201d\n\u201c[S]uch wording appears to be generic in the context of applicant\u2019s goods and/or services,\u201d the examiner wrote.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Available through May 9 or while tables last. Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nTesla will be allowed to submit evidence and arguments to support its argument in favor of the trademark. If it does, the USPTO wants Tesla to provide \u201c[f]act sheets, instruction manuals, brochures, advertisements and pertinent screenshots of applicant\u2019s website as it relates to the goods and/or services in the application, including any materials using the terms in the applied-for mark.\u201d\nIn other words, Tesla needs to give the agency specific plans for how and why it deserves the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d trademark.\nThe examiner also wrote that Tesla will need to tell the USPTO if \u201ccompetitors\u201d use the terms \u201cROBO, ROBOT, or ROBOTIC to advertise similar goods and/or services.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s other application for the \u201cRobotaxi\u201d trademark would cover the use of the word when offering transportation services, including \u201ccoordinating travel arrangements for individuals and for groups,\u201d \u201carranging time-based ridesharing services,\u201d and offering vehicle sharing or rentals. That application was also assigned to a USPTO examiner on April 14, but no decision has been filed.\nThis story has been updated to include information about the \u201cCybercab\u201d trademark applications.\n\ntitle3:\nAnthropic rolls out an API for AI-powered web search\ndescription3:\nAnthropic is launching a new API that allows its Claude AI models to search across the web. Developers using it can build Claude-powered apps that deliver up-to-date info, the company said in a press release published Wednesday.\nThe rollout of the API comes as AI companies look to augment their models in various ways that might attract new customers to their platforms. For its part, Anthropic last week debuted a tool to connect applications to Claude as well as an expanded \u201cdeep research\u201d capability that lets Claude search enterprise accounts, websites, and more.\n\u201cDevelopers can now augment Claude\u2019s comprehensive knowledge with current, real-world data by enabling the web search tool when making requests to [our] API,\u201d Anthropic wrote in its release. \u201cWith web search, developers can now build AI solutions that tap into current information without needing to manage their own web search infrastructure.\u201d\nWeb search is now available on our API.\nDevelopers can augment Claude's comprehensive knowledge with up-to-date data. pic.twitter.com/pRQf0ZKXUZ \u2014 Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) May 7, 2025\nWhen the web search API is enabled, Claude will use \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities to determine whether a given request would benefit from up-to-date information or specialized knowledge. If Claude decides to search the web, it\u2019ll generate a search query, retrieve results, analyze them, and provide an answer with citations.\nClaude can also refine its queries and conduct multiple searches, using earlier results to inform subsequent queries. Developers can customize this behavior as well as specify domains from which Claude is allowed and not allowed to search. Devs can also allow or prohibit web search use at the organization level, Anthropic says.\nPricing starts at $10 per 1,000 searches. Search works with Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, newer Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku models.\nDevs can block Claude from searching certain domains Image Credits:Anthropic\nIn related news, Anthropic is bringing web search to Claude Code, its tool that allows devs to tap Claude to complete various coding tasks. With web search enabled, Claude Code can access current API documentation, technical articles, and other information on development tools and libraries.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Cue\u2019s disclosure was part of his testimony regarding Apple and Google\u2019s estimated $20 billion-a-year deal that makes Google the default search engine on Safari.\nHe noted that searches on Safari declined for the first time last month, a change that he attributes to the increased use of AI.\nCue also stated that he believes AI search providers will end up replacing traditional search engines like Google, which is why Apple is actively looking to add these services to its browser. However, Cue noted that these services probably won\u2019t be the default, as he believes they still need to improve.\nApple has already had some discussions with Perplexity, Cue said.\"\n\nResponse:",
