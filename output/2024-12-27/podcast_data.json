In a blog post published on Friday, OpenAI\u2019s board said it will replace the company\u2019s existing structure with one that puts control into the hands of its for-profit arm.\nGoing into 2025, OpenAI plans to become a Public Benefit Corporation\u2060 (PBC), which is a for-profit company meant to operate for the good of society. This division will \u201crun and control OpenAI\u2019s operations and business,\u201d while OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit will retain a stake in the business but lose its oversight role.\nThe nonprofit will operate separately with its own leadership team and staff \u201cto pursue charitable initiatives in sectors such as health care, education, and science.\u201d The board said the structure will allow OpenAI to \u201craise the necessary capital\u201d to build toward artificial general intelligence while also creating \u201cone of the best resourced non-profits in history.\u201d OpenAI\u2019s competitors, including Anthropic and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, also operate as PBCs.\nRumors about OpenAI\u2019s transition into a for-profit company have been swirling for months as the company looks for ways to appeal to investors and raise money to keep its data-hungry AI models up and running. In September, Bloomberg reported that CEO Sam Altman would receive around a 7 percent equity stake as part of OpenAI\u2019s plans to become a for-profit company, something Altman reportedly denied.\n\u201cThe hundreds\u2060 of\u2060 billions\u2060 of\u2060 dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development show what it will really take for OpenAI to continue pursuing the mission,\u201d the board wrote. \u201cWe once again need to raise more capital than we\u2019d imagined. Investors want to back us but, at this scale of capital, need conventional equity and less structural bespokeness.\u201d\nUnder the structure outlined by OpenAI\u2019s board, the nonprofit would get shares in the PBC \u201cat a fair valuation determined by independent financial advisors.\u201d Concerns about keeping OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit board in control boiled over last year, when its members ousted Altman but later reinstated him.\n\ntitle1:\nBench shuts down, leaving thousands of businesses without access to accounting and tax docs\ndescription1:\nBench, a Canada-based accounting startup that offered software-as-a-service for small and medium-sized businesses, has abruptly shut down, according to a notice posted on its website.\n\u201cWe regret to inform you that as of December 27, 2024, the Bench platform will no longer be accessible,\u201d the notice reads. \u201cWe know this news is abrupt and may cause disruption, so we\u2019re committed to helping Bench customers navigate through the transition.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s entire website is currently offline except for the notice, leaving thousands of businesses in the lurch. Bench touted having more than 35,000 U.S. customers just hours before it was shut down, according to a snapshot saved by the Internet Archive.\nBench, which had raised $113 million from high-profile backers such as Shopify and Bain Capital Ventures, developed a software platform to help customers store and manage their bookkeeping and tax reporting documents.\nThe move is a shock to current and former customers. Justin Metros, the co-founder and CTO of Radiator, said years of his company\u2019s accounting and tax documents are still stored on the site, although he no longer uses the platform. He learned about the shutdown from TechCrunch.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone just shut down like that,\u201d Metros said. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d\nOthers are airing their concerns on social media, with one posting, \u201cas a customer, I\u2019m pissed,\u201d having just migrated from QuickBooks to Bench.\nBench\u2019s notice says its customers should file a six-month extension with the IRS to \u201cfind the right bookkeeping partner.\u201d It also says customers will be able to download their data by December 30 and will have until March 2025 to do so.\nThe notice recommends customers migrate to Kick, a new accounting startup that announced its $9 million seed raise in October 2024 in a round led by OpenAI and General Catalyst. Kick\u2019s CEO and founder, Conrad Wadowski, posted a message on LinkedIn to former Bench users about how Kick is \u201cworking to get your financials back in your hands.\u201d\nBench did not respond to requests for comment by TechCrunch as of press time. Wadowski did not respond directly to a question from TechCrunch about details of any possible agreement or other business relationship it had with Bench prior to the shutdown.\n\u201cAs you saw on the website, we\u2019re moving fast and are available to support many of Bench\u2019s customers with their bookkeeping needs,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nFounded in 2012, Bench employed more than 600 staff, according to a snapshot of its \u201cAbout\u201d page. The startup was backed by investors, including IT firm Sage, Contour Venture Partners, and Altos Ventures. It was also a member of the TechStars accelerator.\nBench last raised $60 million in a Series C round in 2021. Its co-founder and CEO, Ian Crosby, departed shortly after.\nCrosby posted on LinkedIn today that he was \u201cvery sad\u201d to see Bench shut down, alleging he had been replaced by unnamed board members who wanted to bring in \u201ca new professional CEO\u201d to take Bench in a different direction.\n\u201cI hope the story of Bench goes on to become a warning for VCs that think they can \u2018upgrade\u2019 a company by replacing the founder. It never works,\u201d Crosby wrote.\n\ntitle2:\nDo Kwon will be extradited to the US to face charges over Terra\u2019s $40 billion crypto crash\ndescription2:\nDo Kwon, the co-founder of the collapsed cryptocurrency firm Terraform Labs, will be extradited to the US to face federal fraud charges, as reported earlier by Bloomberg. The Montenegro Ministry of Justice announced the decision on Friday, which comes more than one year after the authorities arrested Kwon in the country.\nKwon faces charges in the US and South Korea after the TerraUSD stablecoin and its sister token Luna crashed in 2022, causing investors to lose $40 billion in the process. Both countries have issued extradition requests for Kwon, and have been awaiting Montenegro\u2019s decision for months.\n\ntitle3:\nCyber firm's Chrome extension hijacked to steal user passwords\ndescription3:\nData-loss prevention startup Cyberhaven says hackers published a malicious update to its Chrome extension that was capable of stealing customer passwords and session tokens, according to an email sent to affected customers, who may have been victims of this suspected supply-chain attack.\nCyberhaven confirmed the cyberattack to TechCrunch on Friday but declined to comment on specifics about the incident.\nAn email from the company sent to customers, obtained and published by security researcher Matt Johansen, said the hackers compromised a company account to publish a malicious update to its Chrome extension in the early morning of December 25. The email said that for customers running the compromised browser extension, \u201cit is possible for sensitive information, including authenticated sessions and cookies, to be exfiltrated to the attacker\u2019s domain.\u201d\nCyberhaven spokesperson Cameron Coles declined to comment on the email but did not dispute its authenticity.\nIn a brief emailed statement, Cyberhaven said its security team detected the compromise in the afternoon of December 25 and that the malicious extension (version 24.10.4) was then removed from the Chrome Web Store. A new legitimate version of the extension (24.10.5) was released soon after.\nCyberhaven offers products that it says protect against data exfiltration and other cyberattacks, including browser extensions, which allow the company to monitor for potentially malicious activity on websites. The Chrome Web Store shows the Cyberhaven extension has around 400,000 corporate customer users at the time of writing.\nWhen asked by TechCrunch, Cyberhaven declined to say how many affected customers it had notified about the breach. The California-based company lists technology giants Motorola, Reddit, and Snowflake as customers, as well as law firms and health insurance giants.\nAccording to the email that Cyberhaven sent to its customers, affected users should \u201crevoke\u201d and \u201crotate all passwords\u201d and other text-based credentials, such as API tokens. Cyberhaven said customers should also review their own logs for malicious activity. (Session tokens and cookies for logged-in accounts that are stolen from the user\u2019s browser can be used to log in to that account without needing their password or two-factor code, effectively allowing hackers to bypass those security measures.)\nThe email does not specify whether customers should also change any credentials for other accounts stored in the Chrome browser, and Cyberhaven\u2019s spokesperson declined to specify when asked by TechCrunch.\nAccording to the email, the compromised company account was the \u201csingle admin account for the Google Chrome Store.\u201d Cyberhaven did not say how the company account was compromised, or what corporate security policies were in place that allowed the account compromise. The company said in its brief statement that it has \u201cinitiated a comprehensive review of our security practices and will be implementing additional safeguards based on our findings.\u201d\nCyberhaven said it\u2019s hired an incident response firm, which the email to customers says is Mandiant, and is \u201cactively cooperating with federal law enforcement.\u201d\nJaime Blasco, the co-founder and CTO of Nudge Security, said in posts on X that several other Chrome extensions were compromised as apparently part of the same campaign, including several extensions with tens of thousands of users.\nBlasco told TechCrunch that he is still investigating the attacks and believes at this point that there were more extensions compromised earlier this year, including some related to AI, productivity, and VPNs.\n\u201cIt seems it wasn\u2019t targeted against Cyberhaven, but rather opportunistically targeting extension developers,\u201d said Blasco. \u201cI think they went after the extensions that they could based on the developers\u2019 credentials that they had.\u201d\nIn its statement to TechCrunch, Cyberhaven said that \u201cpublic reports suggest this attack was part of a wider campaign to target Chrome extension developers across a wide range of companies.\u201d At this point it\u2019s unclear who is responsible for this campaign, and other affected companies and their extensions have yet to be confirmed.\n\ntitle4:\nHow Google's Sundar Pichai navigated a pressure-filled year\ndescription4:\nIn this article GOOGL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., during Stanford's 2024 Business, Government, and Society forum in Stanford, California, April 3, 2024. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images\nGoogle's blowout earnings report in April, which sparked the biggest rally in Alphabet shares since 2015 and pushed its market cap past $2 trillion for the first time, tempered fear that the company was falling behind in artificial intelligence. As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. \"We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce,\" one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. \"How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?\" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. \"Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases\" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC.\nGoogle DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis (L) and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai open the tech titan's annual I/O developers conference focusing on how artificial intelligence is being woven into search, email, virtual meetings and more. Glenn Chapman | AFP | Getty Images\nThe AI race pressure cooker\nAfter the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had \"offended our users and shown bias,\" according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. \"We definitely messed up on the image generation,\" Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. \"It was mostly due to just not thorough testing.\" The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked \"How many rocks should I eat each day,\" the tool said, \"According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day.\" AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. \"We should act with urgency,\" Reid said. \"When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond.\"\nJaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty Images\nBeyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet.\nA search for vision\nAmid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year.\nA Google quantum processor \"Sycamore\" is held up to the camera wearing blue gloves.

Peter Kneffel | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\nBut as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. \"Google does not have one single visionary leader,\" a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. \"Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed.\" In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of \"chief scientist,\" but internally, he is now listed as an \"IC,\" or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google's scrappy roots. He's flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google's Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company's hit AI products in 2024.\nGoogle Co-Founder Sergey Brin speaks during a press conference after the third game of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google-developed supercomputer AlphaGo at a hotel in Seoul on March 12, 2016. Jung Yeon-Je | AFP | Getty Images\nAfter Brin's hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google's position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they've seen Brin walking around the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they're pursuing. Despite Brin's reemergence, several employees told CNBC they're doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn't strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it's hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat.\nCulture Clashes\nThrough the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company's AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco's waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams.\nGoogle DeepMind co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Demis Hassabis gives a conference during the Mobile World Congress (MWC), the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, in Barcelona on February 26, 2024. Pau Barrena | Afp | Getty Images\nA meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of \"Wicked\" actors, where one, labeled \"execs\" looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled \"Gemini\" while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as \"users.\" A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. \"Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company's future, and are proud to work here,\" the spokesperson said. A few employees say they're no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google's CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more \"cost efficiencies\" across the company in order to invest more in AI. \"I think any organization can always push a little further and I'll be looking at additional opportunities,\" Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a \"Central Reorg Support Team Partner.\" The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff's \"ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations.\" \"Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do,\" one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. \"Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people,\" another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down.\nPro-Palestinian protesters are blocked the Google I/O developer conference entrance to protest Google's Project Nimbus and Israeli attacks on Gaza and Rafah, at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, United States on May 14, 2024. Tayfun Coskun | Anadolu | Getty Images\nTouting its AI technology to clients, Pichai's leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn't violate any of the company's \"AI principles.\" However, documents and reports show the company's agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that \"Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations.\" In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google's security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. \"This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company \"carefully confirmed\" that every person terminated was involved in the protests. \"By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable.\" That round of job eliminations underscored Google's clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars' Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company's original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker's age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for \"Google,\" spelled out in the font of IBM's logo.\"\n\nResponse:",
