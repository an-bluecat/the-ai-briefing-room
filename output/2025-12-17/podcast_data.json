Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday December 18), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nAmazon appoints longtime AWS exec Peter DeSantis to lead new AI org\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy announced in a message to staff on Wednesday that longtime AWS executive Peter DeSantis will lead a new AI-focused organization within the company.\nThis organization will be responsible for Amazon\u2019s AI models like Nova, as well as silicon development and quantum computing, which help make AI tools faster and more efficient.\nDeSantis has spent 27 years at Amazon, including eight years as an SVP for AWS, the cloud provider that powers about one-third of the internet. At AWS\u2019s recent re:Invent event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership.\n\u201cWith our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,\u201d Jassy wrote.\nAmazon\u2019s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations. Last month, AWS announced a $50 billion investment in the U.S. government\u2019s AI infrastructure. Amazon is also reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and has already invested $8 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.\n\ntitle1:\nCisco says Chinese hackers are exploiting its customers with a new zero-day\ndescription1:\nOn Wednesday, Cisco announced hackers are exploiting a critical vulnerability in some of its most popular products that allows the full takeover of affected devices. Worse, there are no patches available at this time.\nIn a security advisory, Cisco said it discovered a hacking campaign on December 10 targeting Cisco AsyncOS software, and in particular the physical and virtual appliances Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager. The advisory said affected devices have a feature called \u201cSpam Quarantine\u201d enabled and are reachable from the internet.\nCisco noted that this feature is not enabled by default and does not need to be exposed to the internet, which may be good news. Michael Taggart, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, told TechCrunch that \u201cthe requirement of an internet-facing management interface and certain features being enabled will limit the attack surface for this vulnerability.\u201d\nHowever, Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher who tracks hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that this appears to be a particularly problematic hacking campaign since a lot of big organizations use the affected products, there are no patches available, and it\u2019s unclear how long the hackers had backdoors in the affected systems.\nAt this point Cisco is not saying how many customers are affected.\nWhen reached by TechCrunch, Cisco spokesperson Meredith Corley did not answer a series of questions, and instead said that the company \u201cis actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.\u201d\nContact Us Do you have more information about this hacking campaign? Such as what companies were targeted? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or Do you have more information about this hacking campaign? Such as what companies were targeted? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or email .\nThe solution Cisco is suggesting to customers right now is essentially to wipe and rebuild the affected products\u2019 software, as there is no patch available.\n\u201c\u200b\u200bIn case of confirmed compromise, rebuilding the appliances is, currently, the only viable option to eradicate the threat actors persistence mechanism from the appliance,\u201d the company wrote.\nThe hackers behind the campaign are linked to China and other known Chinese government hacking groups, according to Cisco Talos, the company\u2019s threat intelligence research team, which published a blog post about the hacking campaign.\nThe researchers wrote that the hackers are taking advantage of the vulnerability, which at this point is a zero-day, to install persistent backdoors, and that the campaign has been ongoing \u201csince at least late November 2025.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nInstacart\u2019s AI-driven pricing tool attracted attention \u2014 now the FTC has questions\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nAccording to Reuters, Instacart is currently getting the regulatory equivalent of a throat-clearing from the FTC, which has sent the grocery delivery platform a civil investigative demand regarding its AI-powered pricing tool, Eversight. Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.\nThe issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly different prices for identical groceries from the same stores \u2014 up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not ties to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn\u2019t mean much.\nDynamic pricing isn\u2019t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it\u2019s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.\nBut there\u2019s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn\u2019t optional). So while the investigation doesn\u2019t prove wrongdoing, it\u2019s hardly shocking that the FTC \u2014 which has investigated data-driven pricing strategies by other companies \u2014 is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone\u2019s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.\n\ntitle3:\nAdobe hit with proposed class-action, accused of misusing authors' work in AI training\ndescription3:\nLike pretty much every other tech company in existence, Adobe has leaned heavily into AI over the past several years. The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including Firefly \u2014 its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company\u2019s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.\nA proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books \u2014 including her own \u2014 to train the company\u2019s SlimLM program.\nAdobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be \u201coptimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.\u201d It states that SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a \u201cdeduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset\u201d released by Cerebras in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.\nLyon\u2019s lawsuit, which was originally reported on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe\u2019s program: \u201cThe SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.\u201d\n\u201cBooks3\u201d \u2014 a huge collection of 191,000 books that have been used to train GenAI systems \u2014 has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, a lawsuit against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to train its Apple Intelligence model. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works \u201cwithout consent and without credit or compensation.\u201d In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce also claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes.\nUnfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5 billion to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.\n\ntitle4:\nAmazon reportedly in talks to invest $10B in OpenAI as circular deals stay popular\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nAmazon is in early discussions to invest as much as $10 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would see the AI lab using the e-commerce giant\u2019s AI chips, CNBC reported.\nIf it materializes, the deal would value OpenAI at more than $500 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. The Information was first to report on the story.\nAmazon has been looking to diversify its bets in the AI race, which has so far seen it partner up with and invest $8 billion in Anthropic, a rival to OpenAI. The e-commerce giant earlier this month also unveiled the latest iteration in its Trainium series of chips, and outlined the development of the next installment of those chips, complementing its cloud computing offerings via Amazon Web Services.\nNews of the deal comes a couple months after OpenAI completed its transition to a for-profit model, which gives it more freedom to strike deals with investors other than Microsoft, one of the company\u2019s earliest backers with a stake of 27%.\nAmazon investing in OpenAI would mark the latest in a series of circular deals in the AI space \u2014 major hardware manufacturers and cloud providers strike deals with young AI companies to use their products, while the upstarts commit to using their data centers and chips for training their AI models.\nThis past March, OpenAI invested $350 million of equity into CoreWeave, which used the funds to buy chips from its backer Nvidia. Those same chips provide compute to OpenAI, which increases CoreWeave\u2019s revenue and in the end makes OpenAI\u2019s stake more valuable. Then in October, OpenAI signed a deal to pick up a 10% stake in AMD and committed to using the chipmaker\u2019s AI GPUs, and also signed a chip usage agreement with Broadcom that month. And in November, the ChatGPT maker signed a $38 billion cloud computing deal with Amazon.\nOpenAI and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\"\n\nResponse:",
