The news comes by way of Musk\u2019s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, who confirmed the reporting with The Wall Street Journal.\nThe unsolicited bid is the latest escalation by Musk in his war with co-founder Sam Altman, with whom he co-founded OpenAI with numerous other individuals back in 2015. Musk is already embroiled in a legal dispute with OpenAI, filing a 2024 injunction against its effort to transition away from its nonprofit status. The Musk-led team is positioning the move as a bid to refocus OpenAI on open sourced AI, as was its initial aim.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for OpenAI to return to the open source, safety-focused force for good it once was,\u201d Musk told The Journal, by way of Toberoff. \u201cWe will make sure that happens.\u201d Musk\u2019s own AI firm, xAI, is involved with the bid, leading to speculation that a successful acquisition could find the two companies merging.\nMusk specifically calls out X\u2019s Grok model in a related statement provided to TechCrunch. \u201cAt x.AI, we live by the values I was promised OpenAI would follow,\u201d the billionaire says. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Grok open source, and we respect the rights of content creators,\u201d said Musk. \u201cIt\u2019s time for OpenAI to return to the open-source, safety-focused force for good it once was. We will make sure that happens.\u201d\nIn response to Musk\u2019s offer, Altman earlier Monday authored a cheeky X post, writing, \u201cno thank you but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\u201d Musk and investors famously purchased Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. TechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI for further comment.\n\ntitle1:\nMacron announces AI investment\ndescription1:\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron greets journalists after meetings with guests at the Elysee Palace before the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, France, July 26, 2024. REUTERS/Yara Nard Yara Nardi | Reuters\nFrance's artificial intelligence sector will receive 109 billion euros ($112.6 billion) of private investment in the \"coming years,\" President Emmanuel Macron announced Sunday ahead of the country's global AI summit. Speaking with French broadcaster TF1, Macron described the multibillion-euro pledge as \"the equivalent for France of what the United States announced with Stargate,\" referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's massive $500 billion private AI investment project. The U.S. joint venture, dubbed Stargate, will see OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank spend up to $500 billion on AI infrastructure in America over the next four years. Meanwhile, the French financing will include commitments from the United Arab Emirates, American and Canadian investments funds and French companies like telecommunications firms Iliad and Orange , and aerospace and defense group Thales . A few days before France's AI Action Summit, which kicked off on Monday, the UAE said it would invest between 30 billion euros and 50 billion euros in the construction of a one-gigawatt AI data center in France as part of a campus focused on the technology's development.\nwatch now\nIliad committed to spending 3 billion euros on AI infrastructure, while Paris-based AI firm Mistral announced plans to invest billions to build its own data center in France. Victor Riparbelli, CEO of British AI startup Synthesia, said Macron's 109-billion-euro investment plan was a \"great\" thing for the European AI ecosystem \u2014 but added that more is needed to ensure the continent is able to compete with tech heavyweights like the U.S. and China. \"We need to set the right foundations for Europe to thrive as an ecosystem,\" Riparbelli told CNBC's Arjun Kharpal Monday. \"It's great that we invest more in infrastructure. I don't think it's the sole solution to the problem. There's lots of other things we need to worry about as well. But what I think is really great, is there's political will to actually do something,\" he added.\nGlobal AI race in focus\nThe Artificial Intelligence Action Summit will see world leaders and bosses from some of the leading companies developing the technology gather in Paris. Big-name attendees include U.S. Vice President JD Vance, EU President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft President Brad Smith, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. Elon Musk is currently not slated to attend. On Saturday, Axios reported that OpenAI's Altman will this week warn world leaders they need to widen their AI mindset so that, rather than just focusing on risk \u2014 as has often been the case in Europe \u2014 leaders will instead look to embrace growth and opportunity.\nThe emergence of Chinese firm DeepSeek's breakthrough open-source AI model R1 in recent weeks has stirred debates in the industry around the huge capital expenditures companies are committing toward computing infrastructure to train their systems. DeepSeek said total training costs for its newest AI model amounted to $5.6 million. However, doubts have been raised about DeepSeek's claims. Last month, semiconductor research firm SemiAnalysis estimated that DeepSeek's hardware spend is higher than $500 million over the company's history, adding that the startup's research and development and ownership costs are significant. On Sunday, Google DeepMind's Hassabis said DeepSeek's AI model is \"probably the best work\" he's seen out of China \u2014 but added that, from a technology point of view, it was not a big change. \"Despite the hype, there's no actual new scientific advance \u2026 it's using known techniques [in AI],\" Hassabis said, adding that the hype around Deepseek has been \"exaggerated a little bit.\" Nevertheless, with companies spending billions on data centers filled with advanced semiconductors from U.S. chipmaker Nvidia , DeepSeek's new model has led to worries of a potential bubble in the AI space. Ahead of the AI summit, Mike Capone, CEO of U.S. software firm Qlik, told CNBC that DeepSeek is likely to be a major discussion point this week as world governments grapple with China's AI advances. \"This summit isn't just about AI\u2014it's about influence,\" Capone told CNBC on Friday. \"Expect a strategic messaging war as U.S., French, and UK AI leaders downplay DeepSeek's relevance while China works to prove it's not just catching up \u2014 it's setting the pace.\" \"AI diplomacy is now as critical as AI development. The power struggle won't be about who builds the best model; it'll be about who controls the AI narrative,\" he added. - CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report\n\ntitle2:\nThese are the investors funding Musk's $97 billion OpenAI takeover attempt\ndescription2:\nAs if Elon Musk doesn\u2019t have enough going on, a consortium of investors led by him announced plans Monday for what appears to be a hostile takeover of OpenAI.\nThe investor group offered nearly $97.4 billion to buy all of OpenAI\u2019s assets and is \u201cprepared to consider matching or exceeding higher bids,\u201d it said in a press release sent to TechCrunch.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman isn\u2019t having it. He immediately replied on X, \u201cno thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.\u201d\nThe consortium includes Baron Capital Group Inc., Valor Management LLC, Atreides Management, LP, Vy Fund III L.P., Emmanuel Capital Management LLC, and Eight Partners VC LLC.\nWhile Emanuel Capital Management has a slimmer public profile, the others are firmly in Musk\u2019s orbit.\nBaron Capital Group, which manages multiple mutual funds, was founded by Ron Baron. The firm\u2019s Baron Partners Fund, which he manages with his son Michael Baron, has large stakes in Tesla and SpaceX.\nAtreides Management is associated with Boston-based hedge fund Atreides. As we previously reported, founder Gavin Baker spent 18 years at Fidelity where he made his first investment in SpaceX. Atreides has also invested in Tesla and Baker was a public supporter of Musk\u2019s enormous Tesla pay package.\nValor Management was founded by Antonio Gracias, an early SpaceX investor and former Tesla board member. He was also an investor in Musk\u2019s SolarCity before Tesla acquired it.\nVy Capital, founded by Alexander Tamas, also has a SpaceX stake and has invested in a number of other Musk companies like The Boring Company and Neuralink.\nEight Partners VC is better known as Joe Lonsdale\u2019s firm 8VC, according to public filings. Lonsdale is a vocal fan of Musk and runs in similar circles. He recently appeared on CNBC calling himself \u201ca huge fan\u201d of Musk\u2019s DOGE, an interview that Musk reposted on X.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how serious this group is. One plausible analysis floating around the internet is that this is as much trolling as offer. Some say this is Musk\u2019s attempt to drive up the price that Altman\u2019s team would have to pay to buy OpenAI\u2019s underlying assets in order to restructure it from its original nonprofit status.\nMusk was part of the founding of OpenAI as a nonprofit AI research organization and Musk has been attempting to halt Altman\u2019s restructuring plans.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle DeepMind CEO\ndescription3:\nIn this article GOOGL Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nGoogle DeepMind co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Demis Hassabis gives a conference during the Mobile World Congress (MWC), the telecom industry's biggest annual gathering, in Barcelona on February 26, 2024. Pau Barrena | Afp | Getty Images\nPARIS \u2014 DeepSeek's AI model \"is probably the best work\" out of China, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind said on Sunday, but added that the company didn't show any new scientific advances. Last month, China's DeepSeek released a research paper that rattled global markets after claiming its AI model was trained at a fraction of the cost of leading AI players and on less-advanced Nvidia chips. DeepSeek's announcement sparked an aggressive stock sell-off and sparked considerable debate over whether large tech firms are spending too much on AI infrastructure. Hassabis praised DeepSeek's model as \"an impressive piece of work.\"\n\"I think its probably the best work I've seen come out of China,\" Hassabis said at a Google-hosted event in Paris ahead of the AI Action Summit that is being hosted by the city. The DeepMind CEO said the AI model shows that DeepSeek can do \"extremely good engineering\" and that it \"changes things on a geopolitical scale.\" However, from a technology point of view, Hassabis said it was not a big change. \"Despite the hype, there's no actual new scientific advance \u2026 it's using known techniques [in AI],\" he said, adding that the hype around DeepSeek has been \"exaggerated a little bit.\" The DeepMind CEO said that the company's Gemini 2.0 Flash models, which Google this week released to everyone, are more efficient than DeepSeek's model. DeepSeek's claims around its low cost and the chips it uses have been questioned by experts, who think the cost of development for the Chinese firm's models is higher.\nAGI 5 years away\n\ntitle4:\nGoogle changed the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on Maps\ndescription4:\nGoogle Maps officially updated the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on Monday.\nAmong many other executive orders, President Donald Trump decreed on the day of his inauguration that the Gulf of Mexico would be renamed the Gulf of America. This executive order also reverses an Obama-era move to rename Mount McKinley to Denali, the name that Indigenous people have used for centuries. Similarly, the name Gulf of Mexico has been the most prevalent name for the body of water since the 16th century.\nThe president stated that these names are part of a gesture toward \u201c[restoring] American pride in the history of American greatness.\u201d\nAs of Monday afternoon, Google Maps users in the United States will see the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name changed to be the Gulf of America. International users will see both names, while Mexican users will only see the Gulf of Mexico. Google already stated in January that it would comply with Trump\u2019s executive order once the place names were updated in the United States\u2019 Geographic Names Information System.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would send a letter to Google questioning the company\u2019s decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico on Google Maps. But Google\u2019s decision to change the name of the gulf is consistent with its existing policies around how to navigate naming differences between countries. On mobile, Google changes Maps to align with the user\u2019s country location, determined by the user\u2019s operating system, SIM, and network.\nWhile Google has complied with Trump\u2019s order, Apple has not yet updated the name of the Gulf of Mexico or Denali on its Maps app. When searching \u201cGulf of America\u201d on Apple Maps, the app did not yield any results.\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook both attended Trump\u2019s inauguration; Cook personally donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund, while Google also made a $1 million contribution.\nUpdate, 2/10/25, 9:30 PM ET with additional information from Google.\"\n\nResponse:",
