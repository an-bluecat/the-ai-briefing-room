The project could cost between $20 billion to $30 billion, the report added.\nAmbani raised more than $25 billion in 2020 from a group of investors including Meta, Google, Silver Lake, General Atlantic, KKR, Mubadala and PIF to fund the growth of Reliance\u2019s retail and telecom ventures that now dominate the country. Reliance is India\u2019s most valuable company.\nAmbani aims to power the facility primarily with renewable energy from an adjacent green energy complex that will produce solar, wind and hydrogen power.\nAmbani is buying chips from Nvidia for the data center, the report added. Nvidia and Reliance announced a partnership to build infrastructure for AI applications in India in October.\nThe Jamnagar project comes as OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle this week pledged up to $500 billion for AI infrastructure in the United States through their Stargate Project.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\ndescription1:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman kicked off this year by saying in a blog post that 2025 would be big for AI agents, tools that can automate tasks and take actions on your behalf.\nNow, we\u2019re seeing OpenAI\u2019s first real attempt.\nOpenAI announced on Thursday that it is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator is coming to U.S. users on ChatGPT\u2019s $200 Pro subscription plan first. OpenAI says it plans to roll this feature out to more users in its Plus, Team, and Enterprise tiers eventually.\n\u201c[Operator] will be [in] other countries soon,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during a livestream Thursday. \u201cEurope will, unfortunately, take a while.\u201d\nThis initial research preview is available through operator.chatgpt.com, but soon, OpenAI says it wants to integrate Operator into all of its ChatGPT clients.\nOperator\u2019s home screen. Image Credits:OpenAI\nOperator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online, according to OpenAI. There are several task categories users can choose from within the Operator interface, including shopping, delivery, dining, and travel \u2014 all of which enable different kinds of automation.\nWhen ChatGPT users activate Operator, a small window will pop up showing a dedicated web browser that the agent uses to complete tasks, along with explanations of specific actions the agent is performing. Users can still take control of their screen while Operator is working, as Operator uses its own dedicated browser.\nOpenAI says that Operator is powered by a Computer-Using Agent model, or CUA, that combines the vision capabilities of the company\u2019s GPT-4o model with reasoning abilities from OpenAI\u2019s more advanced models. The CUA is trained to interact with the front-end of websites, meaning it doesn\u2019t need to use developer-facing APIs to tap into different services.\nIn other words, the CUA can use buttons, navigate menus, and fill out forms on a web page much like a human would.\nOpenAI says it\u2019s collaborating with companies like DoorDash, eBay, Instacart, Priceline, StubHub, and Uber to ensure that Operator respects these businesses\u2019 terms of service agreements.\nImage Credits:OpenAI\n\u201cThe CUA model is trained to ask for user confirmation before finalizing tasks with external side effects, for example before submitting an order, sending an email, etc., so that the user can double-check the model\u2019s work before it becomes permanent,\u201d OpenAI writes in materials provided to TechCrunch. \u201c[It] has already proven useful in a variety of cases, and we aim to extend that reliability across a wider range of tasks.\u201d\nBut OpenAI warns the CUA isn\u2019t perfect. The company says it \u201c[doesn\u2019t] expect [the] CUA to perform reliably in all scenarios just yet.\u201d\n\u201cCurrently, Operator cannot reliably handle many complex or specialized tasks,\u201d OpenAI adds in a support document, \u201csuch as creating detailed slideshows, managing intricate calendar systems, or interacting with highly customized or non-standard web interfaces.\nOut of an abundance of caution, OpenAI is also requiring supervision for some tasks, like banking transactions, the CUA and Operator could perform mostly on their own. Users will need to take over to put in credit card information, for example. OpenAI says that Operator doesn\u2019t collect or screenshot any data.\n\u201cOn particularly sensitive websites, such as email, Operator requires active user supervision, ensuring users can directly catch and address any potential mistakes the model might make,\u201d OpenAI says in its support materials.\nThis limits the usefulness of Operator, to be sure \u2014 but also ensures that the agent doesn\u2019t hallucinate and, say, spend your mortgage payment on accent chairs. Google took a similar approach with its Project Mariner AI agent, which also doesn\u2019t fill in info like credit card numbers.\nLimitations\nOperator has a few limitations worth noting.\nThere are rate limits \u2014 both daily and task-dependent. OpenAI says that Operator can perform multiple tasks at once, but that there are \u201cdynamic limits\u201d on this. There is also an overall usage limit that resets daily.\nAt this release stage, Operator will also refuse to perform tasks outright for security reasons, like sending emails (despite the fact that the CUA is capable of this) and deleting calendar events. OpenAI says this will change in the future, but gives no ETA.\nOperator may also get \u201cstuck\u201d if it runs into a particularly complex interface, password field, or CAPTCHA check. It\u2019ll ask the user to take over when this occurs, OpenAI says.\nAn agentic future\nOpenAI has been rather slow to develop an AI agent compared to rivals (see: agents from Rabbit, Google, and Anthropic), which may have something to do with the safety risks around the technology.\nWhen an AI system can take actions on the web, it opens the door to much more dangerous use cases from nefarious actors. You could automate AI agents to orchestrate phishing scams or DDoS attacks, or have them snatch up tickets to a concert before anyone else could. Especially for a tool as widely used as ChatGPT, it\u2019s important OpenAI take steps to prevent those sorts of exploits.\nOpenAI seems to think Operator is safe enough to release in its current form, at least as a research preview.\n\u201cOperator employs tools that seek to limit the model\u2019s susceptibility to malicious prompts, hidden instructions, and phishing attempts,\u201d OpenAI explains on its website. \u201cA monitoring system pauses execution if suspicious activity is detected, while automated and human-reviewed pipelines continuously update safeguards.\u201d\nOperator is OpenAI\u2019s boldest attempt yet at creating an AI agent. Last week, OpenAI released Tasks, giving ChatGPT simple automation features such as the ability to set reminders and schedule prompts to run at a set time every day.\nTasks gave ChatGPT users some familiar, but necessary, features to make ChatGPT as practical to use as Siri or Alexa. However, Operator shows off capabilities that the previous generation of virtual assistants could never do.\nAI agents have been pitched as the next big thing in AI after ChatGPT: a new technology that will change how people use the internet and their PCs. Instead of simply delivering and processing information, agents can \u2014 in theory \u2014 take actions and actually do things.\nWith the release of OpenAI\u2019s first concrete take on agents, it\u2019ll soon become clear just how realistic this vision is.\n\ntitle2:\nApple and Google hit with UK antitrust probe into mobile ecosystems\ndescription2:\nOmar Marques | Lightrocket | Getty Images\nLONDON \u2014 Britain's competition regulator on Thursday launched an investigation into Apple and Google's huge mobile ecosystems to determine whether the tech titans are in breach of the U.K.'s strict new digital competition rules. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said it was opening dual probes into both U.S. tech giants to assess whether they hold \"strategic market status\" in their respective mobile ecosystems, including operating systems, app stores and smartphone-based browsers. The investigations will \"explore the impact on people who use mobile devices and the thousands of businesses developing innovative services or content such as apps for these devices,\" the CMA said. \"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish,\" an Apple spokesperson told CNBC. \"We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\" \"In the U.K. alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform,\" the Apple spokesperson added. \"We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\"\nwatch now\nOliver Bethell, Google's senior director for competition, said the company's Android platform \"has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratise access to smartphones and apps.\" \"It's the only example of a successful and viable open source mobile operating system,\" said Bethell, urging for a \"way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for U.K. consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to U.K. growth prospects.\" Earlier this week, the U.K. replaced CMA Chair Marcus Bokkerink with Doug Gurr, a former Amazon U.K. country manager. At the time, the watchdog noted that regulators had been asked in a recent meeting with the government to \"tear down the barriers hindering business and refocus their efforts on promoting growth.\" Labour MP Dan Aldridge said via email that the launch of the CMA's investigation into Apple and Google was \"a crucial step forward in ensuring fair competition in our digital economy.\" \"Companies such as Apple and Google decide which ones we access and how much we pay,\" he said in an emailed comment Thursday. \"These investigations will examine these practices, as they can stifle innovation and lead to higher prices for consumers.\"\nNew powers\nThe CMA now has enhanced regulatory powers after a new U.K. law, called the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, or DMCC, came into effect at the start of this year. The DMCC seeks to prevent anti-competitive behavior in digital markets. It can designate large companies that have a significant amount of market power in a certain digital activity as having \"strategic market status.\" The CMA now has the power to impose changes to prevent potential anti-competitive behavior from any firm that is given strategic market status.\n\ntitle3:\nFitbit fined $12M over Ionic smartwatch burns\ndescription3:\nFitbit has settled with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) over a long-standing defect that caused some wearers to sustain burns. The deal finds the Google-owned fitness company paying a $12.25 million penalty for the issues surrounding its Ionic smartwatch.\nThe issue dates back to 2018, continuing on into 2020. Fitbit agreed to recall the wearable in March 2022, as the CPSC noted that it \u201ccreated an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death to consumers.\u201d\nA firmware update issued in early 2020 failed to address the issue entirely, according to the CPSC.\n\u201cDespite possessing information that reasonably supported the conclusion that the smartwatches contained a defect that could create a substantial product hazard or created an unreasonable risk of serious injury, Fitbit did not immediately report to the Commission as required,\u201d the organization notes.\nIn all, 115 U.S. consumers reported an issue with the smartwatch\u2019s overheating battery. Seventy-eight people reported burns, two of which were third-degree and four second-degree burns.\nThe agreement also requires Fitbit to submit an annual report to the commission, with an internal audit of safety operations. Fitbit is also required to \u201cmaintain internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), including enhancements made to its compliance program,\u201d per the agreement.\n\ntitle4:\nScale AI CEO says China has quickly caught the U.S. with DeepSeek\ndescription4:\nWang also said he believes the AI sector will reach a trillion dollars, on par with estimates that the generative AI market is poised to top $1 trillion in revenue within a decade.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Wang described the artificial intelligence race between the U.S. and China as an \"AI war,\" adding that he believes China has significantly more Nvidia H100 GPUs \u2014 AI chips that are widely used to build leading powerful AI models \u2014 than people may think, especially considering U.S. export controls.\n\"What we've found is that DeepSeek ... is the top performing, or roughly on par with the best American models,\" Wang said.\nWang, whose company provides training data to key AI players including OpenAI, Google and Meta , said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that DeepSeek, the leading Chinese AI lab, released an \"earth-shattering model\" on Christmas Day, then followed it up with a powerful reasoning-focused AI model, DeepSeek-R1, which competes with OpenAI's recently released o1 model.\nThe U.S. may have led China in the artificial intelligence race for the past decade, according to Alexandr Wang, CEO of Scale AI, but on Christmas Day, everything changed.\n\"The United States is going to need a huge amount of computational capacity, a huge amount of infrastructure,\" Wang said, later adding, \"We need to unleash U.S. energy to enable this AI boom.\"\nEarlier this week, President Donald Trump announced a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to invest billions of dollars in U.S. AI infrastructure. The project, Stargate, was unveiled at the White House by Trump, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Key initial technology partners will include Microsoft, Nvidia and Oracle, as well as semiconductor company Arm. They said they would invest $100 billion to start and up to $500 billion over the next four years.\nIn the interview Thursday, Wang said he believes that it'll take two to four years to reach artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a widely cited but vaguely defined benchmark used in the AI sector to denote a branch of AI pursuing technology that equals or surpasses human intellect on a wide range of tasks. AGI is a hotly debated topic, with some leaders saying we're close to attaining it and some saying it's not possible at all. Wang said his own definition of AGI is \"powerful AI systems that are able to use a computer just like you or I could ... and basically be a remote worker in the most capable way.\"\nAnthropic, the Amazon -backed AI startup founded by ex-OpenAI research executives, ramped up its technology development throughout the past year, and in October, the startup said that its AI agents were able to use computers like humans can to complete complex tasks. Anthropic's Computer Use capability allows its technology to interpret what's on a computer screen, select buttons, enter text, navigate websites and execute tasks through any software and real-time internet browsing, the startup said.\nThe tool can \"use computers in basically the same way that we do,\" Jared Kaplan, Anthropic's chief science officer, told CNBC in an interview at the time.
