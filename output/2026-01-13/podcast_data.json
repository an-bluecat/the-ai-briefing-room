However, there are some hints contained within a document that outlines an array of proposals and promises Hochul made in her State of the State address.\nAmong them is language to expand the state\u2019s existing AV pilot program to allow for \u201cthe limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.\u201d\nThe document goes on to say companies that want to operate robotaxi services commercially will have to submit applications that \u201cdemonstrate local support for AV deployment and adherence to the highest possible safety standards.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear what \u201climited deployment\u201d or \u201chighest possible safety standards\u201d mean. Nor does the document outline how the state will track or make judgments on a company\u2019s safety record, except that multiple agencies will be involved, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, Department of Transportation, and New York State Police.\nThe governor\u2019s office told TechCrunch more will be shared in the governor\u2019s executive budget proposal that is set to be released on January 20.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nStill, the remarks were enough of an opening to make Alphabet-owned Waymo cheer.\n\u201cGovernor Hochul\u2019s proposal to legalize fully autonomous vehicles is a transformative moment for New York\u2019s transportation system,\u201d Justin Kintz, Waymo\u2019s head of global public policy, said in an emailed statement.\n\u201cWith the Governor\u2019s leadership, New York has the opportunity to pair its investments in slower speeds, better traffic enforcement, and first-in-the-nation congestion management strategies with Waymo\u2019s demonstrably safe technology, creating a future where living in New York is safer, easier, and more accessible. We\u2019re ready to work with leaders around the state to make this future a reality, and bring new infrastructure, career opportunities, and investment to the Empire State,\u201d said Kintz.\nWaymo and other companies have tried for years to enter New York state with limited success. Current New York state law mandates that drivers keep one hand on the wheel at all times. That poses a problem for robotaxi operators like Waymo since no human is behind the wheel \u2014 if there is a steering wheel at all.\nThe state\u2019s AV pilot program has provided an exemption to that rule, theoretically allowing companies to develop and test autonomous vehicles in the state.\nStill, there are significant hurdles, particularly in New York City. Last August, city regulators granted a permit to Waymo to test its robotaxis in the densely populated city. Under that permit, Waymo can deploy up to eight of its Jaguar I-Pace vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn with a human safety operator behind the wheel. A Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch that the permit has been extended until March 31.\nEven with the permit, Waymo can\u2019t carry passengers or operate a commercial robotaxi service without getting separate licenses from the city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission.\nAnd while legislation was introduced last year to create a framework for driverless operation, it has languished in the state Senate\u2019s transportation committee. The governor\u2019s proposal could help loosen that bottleneck.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft announces glut of new data centers but says it won't let your electricity bill go up\ndescription1:\nAlthough public backlash against data centers has been intense over the past 12 months, all of the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies have promised additional buildouts of AI infrastructure in the coming year. That includes OpenAI partner Microsoft, which, on Tuesday, announced what it calls a \u201ccommunity-first\u201d approach to AI Infrastructure.\nMicrosoft\u2019s announcement, which comes only a day after Mark Zuckerberg said that Meta would launch its own AI infrastructure program, isn\u2019t unexpected. Last year, the company announced that it planned to spend billions to expand its AI capacity. What is a little unusual are the promises the company has now made about how it will handle that buildout.\nOn Tuesday, Microsoft promised to take the \u201csteps needed to be a good neighbor in the communities where we build, own, and operate our data centers.\u201d That includes, according to the company, its plans to \u201cpay its own way\u201d to ensure that local electricity bills don\u2019t go through the roof in the places where it builds. Specifically, the company says it will work with local utility companies to ensure that the rates it pays cover its full share of its burden on the local grid.\n\u201cWe will work closely with utility companies that set electricity prices and state commissions that approve these prices,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cOur goal is straightforward: to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our data centers is not passed on to residential customers.\u201d\nThe company has also promised to create jobs in the communities where it touches down, as well as to minimize the amount of water that its centers need to function. Water usage by data centers has obviously been a contentious topic, with data centers accused of creating substantial issues for local water supplies and spurring other environmental concerns. The jobs promise is also relevant, given lingering questions around the number of both short-term and permanent jobs that such projects typically create.\nIt\u2019s pretty clear why Microsoft feels it is necessary to make these promises right now. Data center construction has become a political flashpoint in recent years, generating intense backlash and protest from local communities. Data Center Watch, an organization that tracks anti-data center activism, has observed that there are as many as 142 different activist groups across 24 states currently organizing against such developments.\nThis backlash has already impacted Microsoft directly. In October, the company abandoned plans for a new data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after \u201ccommunity feedback\u201d was overwhelmingly negative. In Michigan, meanwhile, the company\u2019s plans for a similar project in a small central township have recently inspired locals to take to the streets in protest. On Tuesday, around the same time Microsoft announced its \u201cgood neighbor\u201d pledge, an op-ed in an Ohio newspaper (where Microsoft is currently developing several data center campuses) excoriated the company, blaming it and its peers for climate change.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nConcerns have extended even to the White House, where an AI buildout has become one of the major tenets of the Trump administration. On Monday, President Trump took to social media to promise that Microsoft specifically would make \u201cmajor changes\u201d to ensure that Americans\u2019 electricity bills wouldn\u2019t rise. Trump said the changes would \u201censure that Americans don\u2019t \u2018pick up the tab\u2019 for their power consumption.\u201d\nIn short, by now, Microsoft understands that it\u2019s fighting a tide of negative public opinion. It remains to be seen whether the company\u2019s new assurances of jobs, environmental stewardship, and low electricity bills will be enough to turn the tide.\n\ntitle2:\nDoctors think AI has a place in healthcare - but maybe not as a chatbot\ndescription2:\nDr. Sina Bari, a practicing surgeon and AI healthcare leader at data company iMerit, has seen firsthand how ChatGPT can lead patients astray with faulty medical advice.\n\u201cI recently had a patient come in, and when I recommended a medication, they had a dialogue printed out from ChatGPT that said this medication has a 45% chance of pulmonary embolism,\u201d Dr. Bari told TechCrunch.\nWhen Dr. Bari investigated further, he found that the statistic was from a paper about the impact of that medication in a niche subgroup of people with tuberculosis, which didn\u2019t apply to his patient.\nAnd yet, when OpenAI announced its dedicated ChatGPT Health chatbot last week, Dr. Bari felt more excitement than concern.\nChatGPT Health, which will roll out in the coming weeks, allows users to talk to the chatbot about their health in a more private setting, where their messages won\u2019t be used as training data for the underlying AI model.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Dr. Bari said. \u201cIt is something that\u2019s already happening, so formalizing it so as to protect patient information and put some safeguards around it [\u2026] is going to make it all the more powerful for patients to use.\u201d\nUsers can get more personalized guidance from ChatGPT Health by uploading their medical records and syncing with apps like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. For the security-minded, this raises immediate red flags.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\u201cAll of a sudden there\u2019s medical data transferring from HIPAA-compliant organizations to non-HIPAA-compliant vendors,\u201d Itai Schwartz, co-founder of data loss prevention firm MIND, told TechCrunch. \u201cSo I\u2019m curious to see how the regulators would approach this.\u201d\nBut the way some industry professionals see it, the cat is already out of the bag. Now, instead of Googling cold symptoms, people are talking to AI chatbots \u2014 over 230 million people already talk to ChatGPT about their health each week.\n\u201cThis was one of the biggest use cases of ChatGPT,\u201d Andrew Brackin, a partner at Gradient who invests in health tech, told TechCrunch. \u201cSo it makes a lot of sense that they would want to build a more kind of private, secure, optimized version of ChatGPT for these healthcare questions.\u201d\nAI chatbots have a persistent problem with hallucinations, a particularly sensitive issue in healthcare. According to Vectara\u2019s Factual Consistency Evaluation Model, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 is more prone to hallucinations than many Google and Anthropic models. But AI companies see the potential to rectify inefficiencies in the healthcare space (Anthropic also announced a health product this week).\nFor Dr. Nigam Shah, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chief data scientist for Stanford Health Care, the inability of American patients to access care is more urgent than the threat of ChatGPT dispensing poor advice.\n\u201cRight now, you go to any health system and you want to meet the primary care doctor \u2014 the wait time will be three to six months,\u201d Dr. Shah said. \u201cIf your choice is to wait six months for a real doctor, or talk to something that is not a doctor but can do some things for you, which would you pick?\u201d\nDr. Shah thinks a clearer route to introduce AI into healthcare systems comes on the provider side, rather than the patient side.\nMedical journals have often reported that administrative tasks can consume about half of a primary care physician\u2019s time, which slashes the number of patients they can see in a given day. If that kind of work could be automated, doctors would be able to see more patients, perhaps reducing the need for people to use tools like ChatGPT Health without additional input from a real doctor.\nDr. Shah leads a team at Stanford that is developing ChatEHR, a software that is built into the electronic health record (EHR) system, allowing clinicians to interact with a patient\u2019s medical records in a more streamlined, efficient manner.\n\u201cMaking the electronic medical record more user friendly means physicians can spend less time scouring every nook and cranny of it for the information they need,\u201d Dr. Sneha Jain, an early tester of ChatEHR, said in a Stanford Medicine article. \u201cChatEHR can help them get that information up front so they can spend time on what matters \u2014 talking to patients and figuring out what\u2019s going on.\u201d\nAnthropic is also working on AI products that can be used on the clinician and insurer sides, rather than just its public-facing Claude chatbot. This week, Anthropic announced Claude for Healthcare by explaining how it could be used to reduce the time spent on tedious administrative tasks, like submitting prior authorization requests to insurance providers.\n\u201cSome of you see hundreds, thousands of these prior authorization cases a week,\u201d said Anthropic CPO Mike Krieger in a recent presentation at J.P. Morgan\u2019s Healthcare Conference. \u201cSo imagine cutting 20, 30 minutes out of each of them \u2014 it\u2019s a dramatic time savings.\u201d\nAs AI and medicine become more intertwined, there\u2019s an inescapable tension between the two worlds \u2014 a doctor\u2019s primary incentive is to help their patients, while tech companies are ultimately accountable to their shareholders, even if their intentions are noble.\n\u201cI think that tension is an important one,\u201d Dr. Bari said. \u201cPatients rely on us to be cynical and conservative in order to protect them.\u201d\n\ntitle4:\nElevenLabs CEO says the voice AI startup crossed $330M ARR last year\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nElevenLabs, the AI voice-generation startup, crossed $330 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), CEO Mati Staniszewski said in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\u201cReally, what this [growth in ARR] shows is that trajectory across the company. We started the company in 2022 and launched the first product in 2023. It took us 20 months to reach $100 million in ARR, 10 months to reach $200 million, and five months to reach the current number,\u201d he said.\nStaniszewski mentioned that both Fortune 500 companies and startups are adopting its voice agent technology, which uses company data and knowledge bases to power customer support and customer experience interactions. In a separate post on X, the company noted that enterprises have deployed its technology to handle more than 50,000 calls per month.\nThe startup raised $180 million in Series C funding co-led by a16z and ICONIQ Growth at a $3.3 billion valuation in January 2025. It then doubled its valuation months later when ICONIQ and another earlier investor, Sequoia, shelled out another $100 million to snap up employee shares.\nBesides providing models for voice generation and voice agents, the company launched music creation capabilities last year and also struck a deal with celebrities such as Michael Caine and Matthew McConaughey to use their voices for AI-generated content.\"\n\nResponse:",
