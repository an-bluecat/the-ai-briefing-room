The deal underscores the growing importance of secondary markets and buyouts as traditional venture exits remain sluggish.\nThe investment bank is paying $665 million in cash and equity, with up to $300 million more tied to the firm\u2019s performance through 2030, according to a release from Goldman. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year, and all 45 Industry Ventures employees are expected to join Goldman.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Swildens for more information.\nThe acquisition comes as venture funds increasingly turn to non-traditional exits amid a prolonged IPO drought that only now looks to be breaking. Speaking on TechCrunch\u2019s StrictlyVC Download podcast earlier this year, Industry Ventures founder and CEO Hans Swildens said that tech buyout funds now account for 25% of all liquidity in the entire venture ecosystem \u2014 \u201ca huge chunk of liquidity,\u201d he said.\nSwildens explained that venture managers are being forced to adapt their approach. \u201cJust going out and seeing companies, putting them in your fund and then waiting for an IPO or strategic M&A exit probably won\u2019t work anymore,\u201d he said in the podcast interview. \u201c[VCs] need to start working on alternative liquidity solutions.\u201d\nAt the time \u2014 in April \u2014 he noted that at least five major venture funds had hired full-time staff dedicated to manufacturing non-traditional exits, including secondary transactions, continuation funds, and buyouts. \u201cAll the brand name funds are all staffing and thinking through liquidity structures,\u201d Swildens said.\nGoldman is making the acquisition to bolster its $540 billion alternatives investment platform, which the bank has identified as a key growth engine.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cIndustry Ventures\u2019 trusted relationships and venture capital expertise complement our existing investing franchises and expand opportunities for clients to access the fastest growing companies and sectors in the world,\u201d Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a prepared statement. \u201cBy combining the global resources of Goldman Sachs with the venture capital expertise of Industry Ventures, we are uniquely positioned to serve the increasingly complex needs of entrepreneurs, private technology companies, limited partners, and venture fund managers,\u201d the statement continued.\nIndustry Ventures says it has made more than 1,000 investments, has stakes in more than 700 venture firms, and that it boasts an internal rate of return of 18%.\n\ntitle1:\nCalifornia becomes first state to regulate AI companion chatbots\ndescription1:\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a landmark bill on Monday that regulates AI companion chatbots, making it the first state in the nation to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions.\nThe law, SB 243, is designed to protect children and vulnerable users from some of the harms associated with AI companion chatbot use. It holds companies \u2014 from the big labs like Meta and OpenAI to more focused companion startups like Character AI and Replika \u2014 legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet the law\u2019s standards.\nSB 243 was introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, and gained momentum after the death of teenager Adam Raine, who died by suicide after a long series of suicidal conversations with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. The legislation also responds to leaked internal documents that reportedly showed Meta\u2019s chatbots were allowed to engage in \u201cromantic\u201d and \u201csensual\u201d chats with children. More recently, a Colorado family has filed suit against role-playing startup Character AI after their 13-year-old daughter took her own life following a series of problematic and sexualized conversations with the company\u2019s chatbots.\n\u201cEmerging technology like chatbots and social media can inspire, educate, and connect \u2014 but without real guardrails, technology can also exploit, mislead, and endanger our kids,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some truly horrific and tragic examples of young people harmed by unregulated tech, and we won\u2019t stand by while companies continue without necessary limits and accountability. We can continue to lead in AI and technology, but we must do it responsibly \u2014 protecting our children every step of the way. Our children\u2019s safety is not for sale.\u201d\nSB 243 will go into effect January 1, 2026, and requires companies to implement certain features such as age verification, and warnings regarding social media and companion chatbots. The law also implements stronger penalties for those who profit from illegal deepfakes, including up to $250,000 per offense. Companies must also establish protocols to address suicide and self-harm, which will be shared with the state\u2019s Department of Public Health alongside statistics on how the service provided users with crisis center prevention notifications.\nPer the bill\u2019s language, platforms must also make it clear that any interactions are artificially generated, and chatbots must not represent themselves as healthcare professionals. Companies are required to offer break reminders to minors and prevent them from viewing sexually explicit images generated by the chatbot.\nSome companies have already begun to implement some safeguards aimed at children. For example, OpenAI recently began rolling out parental controls, content protections, and a self-harm detection system for children using ChatGPT. Replika, which is designed for adults over the age of 18, told TechCrunch it dedicates \u201csignificant resources\u201d to safety through content-filtering systems and guardrails that direct users to trusted crisis resources, and is committed to complying with current regulations.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

A Character AI spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company \u201cwelcomes working with regulators and lawmakers as they develop regulations and legislation for this emerging space, and will comply with laws, including SB 243.\u201d\nSenator Padilla told TechCrunch the bill was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d towards putting guardrails in place on \u201can incredibly powerful technology.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to move quickly to not miss windows of opportunity before they disappear,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cI hope that other states will see the risk. I think many do. I think this is a conversation happening all over the country, and I hope people will take action. Certainly the federal government has not, and I think we have an obligation here to protect the most vulnerable people among us.\u201d\nSB 243 is the second significant AI regulation to come out of California in recent weeks. On September 29th, Governor Newsom signed SB 53 into law, establishing new transparency requirements on large AI companies. The bill mandates that large AI labs, like OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Google DeepMind, be transparent about safety protocols. It also ensures whistleblower protections for employees at those companies.\nOther states, like Illinois, Nevada, and Utah, have passed laws to restrict or fully ban the use of AI chatbots as a substitute for licensed mental health care.\nTechCrunch has reached out to Meta and OpenAI for comment.\nThis article has been updated with comments from Senator Padilla, Character AI, and Replika.\n\ntitle2:\nSalesforce announces Agentforce 360 as enterprise AI competition heats up\ndescription2:\nSalesforce announced Monday the latest version of its AI agent platform as the company looks to lure enterprises to its AI software in an increasingly crowded market.\nThe customer relations manager giant unveiled the new platform, branded Agentforce 360, ahead of its annual Dreamforce customer conference that kicks off October 14. This newer version of Agentforce includes new ways to instruct AI agents through text, a new platform to build and deploy agents, and new infrastructure for messaging app Slack, among others.\nA notable aspect of Agentforce 360 is its new AI agent prompting tool, called Agent Script, which will be released in beta in November. Agent Script gives users the ability to program their AI agents to be more flexible and better respond to \u201cif/then\u201d situations. This allows AI agents to be programmed to be more predictable in less rigid situations like customer questions.\nUsers can tap into \u201creasoning\u201d models, which claim to think before responding as opposed to responding based on patterns. Anthropic, OpenAI and Google Gemini power these \u201creasoning\u201d agents.\nSalesforce also announced it is releasing a new agent building tool, Agentforce Builder, which allows users to build, test and deploy AI agents from a singular spot. This tool, which will be released in beta in November, includes Agentforce Vibes, an enterprise-grade app vibe coding tool that Salesforce announced earlier this month.\nThe company also announced a broader integration between Agentforce and Slack. Salesforce said its core apps, including Agenforce Sales, IT and HR, among others, will surface directly in Slack starting this month and expand through the beginning of 2026.\nSlack is piloting a new version of its Slackbot chatbot that is meant to be more of a personalized AI agent that learns about its user and will offer insights and suggestions.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nSalesforce wants Slack to serve as an enterprise search tool in the future too and plans to launch connectors with platforms like Gmail, Outlook, and Dropbox in early 2026.\nThis latest update from Salesforce comes at an interesting time for the enterprise AI market. Companies continue to release AI features aimed at their enterprise customers while enterprises struggle to see a return on investment for these tools.\nLast week Google announced Gemini Enterprise, a suite of tools \u2014 many of which were already available \u2014 for building enterprise-grade AI agents, that counts Figma, Klarna and Virgin Voyages as early customers, among others.\nAnthropic also started to show traction for its enterprise product, Claude Enterprise. The company announced it struck a deal with consulting giant Deloitte to bring its Claude chatbot to Deloitte\u2019s 500,000 global employees \u2014 its largest enterprise deal yet. Anthropic announced a strategic partnership with IBM the next day.\nSalesforce touts that Agentforce has 12,000 customers \u2014 significantly higher than any of its competitors, according to its Agentforce press release. Early pilot customers of its Agentforce 360 upgrades include Lennar, Adecco, and Pearson.\nThis is all despite a recent MIT study found that 95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before they reach production as companies still struggle to justify spending money on these AI tools.\n\ntitle3:\nGrindr's owners may take it private after a financial squeeze\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nGrindr\u2019s majority owners are scrambling to take the LGBTQ+ dating app private after a stock decline triggered a personal financial crisis, according to a report from Semafor.\nThe owners in question are Raymond Zage, a former hedge fund manager and U.S. expat now based in Singapore, and James Lu, a Chinese-American entrepreneur and former Amazon and Baidu exec. Together they led the 2020 acquisition of Grindr from Chinese ownership for over $600 million, then took the app public in 2022 through a blank-check merger.\nReportedly, Zage and Lu, who together control more than 60% of Grindr, pledged nearly all their shares as collateral for personal loans from a unit of Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Temasek. After Grindr began a slide at the end of September, those loans became undercollateralized (worth less than the debt), so the Temasek unit seized and sold some of the shares last week.\nGrindr\u2019s stock slide appears disconnected from business fundamentals \u2013 profits were up 25% in the second quarter, Semafor notes, though it has seen some executive turnover; there has been some investor concern about narrowing margins, too.\nEither way, the pair are now said to be in talks with Fortress Investment Group \u2013 itself now majority owned by Mubadala Investment Company, which is itself owned by the government of Abu Dhabi \u2013 to secure financing for a buyout at around $15 per share, which would value Grindr at around $3 billion. Shares jumped following the report.\n\ntitle4:\nAnduril's new EagleEye MR helmet sees Palmer Luckey return to his VR roots\ndescription4:\nIn the latest bid by a Silicon Valley defense firm to assert its own solution for the Army\u2019s mixed-reality ambitions, Anduril Industries on Monday unveiled \u201cEagleEye,\u201d a helmeted computing system that seeks to turn soldiers into AI-augmented warfighters.\nThe launch is notable given that the initiative is led by Anduri\u2019s co-founder Palmer Luckey, who previously started the pioneering VR company, Oculus, which was acquired by Meta.\nAnduril describes EagleEye as a modular \u201cfamily of systems\u201d built atop its Lattice software that puts command-and-control tools, sensor feeds, and AI directly into a soldier\u2019s field of vision.\nThe company claims the system can integrate live video feeds; features rear- and side-sensors to alert operators to threats; and can track teammates in real-time. EagleEye variations include a helmet, visor and glasses.\nThe launch comes as the U.S. Army looks to expand its pool of mixed-reality gear suppliers. It had been using Microsoft\u2019s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a $22 billion program awarded in 2018, but after years of issues, the Army handed control of the contract to Anduril this February.\nThen in September, Anduril won a $159 million award to prototype a new mixed-reality system for soldiers, part of a broader Soldier Borne Mission Command effort. Anduril said the award was \u201cthe largest effort of its kind\u201d to outfit \u201cevery soldier with superhuman perception and decision-making capabilities.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Anduril also announced a partnership with Meta to develop extended reality (XR) devices for the military, marking an unexpected reunion between Luckey and his former employer.\nTechcrunch event DISRUPT FLASH SALE: Save up to $624 until Oct 17 Netflix, Microsoft, Box, Phia, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
