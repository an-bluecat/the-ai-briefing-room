Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

Shares also recorded their best day in nearly a year.\nThe Denver-based software company posted adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share and $828 million in revenue. That topped the 11 cents per share and revenue of $776 million expected by analysts polled by LSEG.\nPalantir also issued upbeat guidance for the current quarter and full year. In the first quarter, the company forecast revenue between $858 million and $862 million. The LSEG estimate called for $799 million. The company projects sales of $3.74 billion to $3.76 billion for the full year, ahead of a $3.52 billion estimate.\nThe software company has been on a record run, with its shares surging 340% in 2024 as its AI platform gained traction amid ongoing investor excitement around the technology trend. Palantir provides software and technology services and is most widely known for its work with defense agencies.\nIn a letter to shareholders, co-founder and CEO Alex Karp called the momentum within its commercial and government segments \"unlike anything that has come before.\"\n\ntitle1:\nGoogle wants Search to be more like an AI assistant in 2025\ndescription1:\nGoogle Search is in the midst of a \u201cjourney\u201d around AI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Tuesday. The start of that journey was AI overviews, a controversial and monumental shift in how Google delivers information to billions of Search users.\nBut that was just the beginning.\n\u201cAs AI continues to expand the universe of queries that people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for search innovation yet,\u201d said Pichai during his opening remarks on the call.\nThroughout the call, Pichai laid out the next phase of Google\u2019s plan to pack Search with AI features from the company\u2019s research lab, DeepMind. The Search product is slowly becoming more like an AI assistant that browses the internet for you, looks at web pages, and returns an answer.\nIt\u2019s a long way off from a simple search system that gives you ten blue links.\nGoogle has been on this path for a few years now, ever since the search giant was caught flat footed by the release of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in 2022. The shift has massive implications for websites that rely on Google\u2019s traffic and businesses that buy ads on Google Search.\nNot everyone is happy about it, but Google is pushing ahead.\nWhen asked about the future of AI and Search, Pichai said that, \u201cYou can imagine the future with Project Astra,\u201d a reference to DeepMind\u2019s multimodal AI system, which can process live video from a camera or computer screen and answer user questions about what the AI sees in real time.\nGoogle has big plans for Project Astra in other parts of its business too. The company says it wants the multimodal AI system to power a pair of augmented reality smart glasses one day, which Google will create the operating system for.\nPichai also mentioned Gemini Deep Research \u2013 an AI agent that takes several minutes to create long research reports \u2013 as a feature that could fundamentally shift how people use Google Search. Deep Research automates work that people have traditionally done with Google Search. But now, it seems Google wants to do that research for users.\n\u201cYou are really dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work \u2013 things which don\u2019t always get answered instantaneously, but can take some time to answer,\u201d said Pichai. \u201cThose are all areas of exploration, and you will see us putting new experiences in front of users through the course of 2025.\u201d\nPichai said further that Google has a \u201cclear sense\u201d of the Search experiences it could create with another one of Google\u2019s AI agents, Project Mariner. That system can use the front-end of websites on behalf of users, making it unnecessary for people to use websites themselves.\nGoogle\u2019s CEO also said there\u2019s an \u201copportunity\u201d around letting users interact more and ask follow-up questions with Google Search. Pichai was light on details there, but it sounds like Google is considering ways to make its Search interface more like a chatbot.\n\u201cI think the [Search] product will evolve even more,\u201d said Pichai. \u201cAs you make it more easy for people to interact and ask follow-up questions, etc., I think we have an opportunity to drive further growth.\u201d\nToday, ChatGPT has matured into one of the internet\u2019s most used products, with hundreds of millions of weekly users. It presents an existential threat to Google Search\u2019s long-term business. To address it, Google is not only building a competitor AI chatbot with Gemini, but also injecting AI features directly in Search.\nOf course, the first step on Google Search\u2019s AI journey did not go very well. When Google rolled out AI overviews to all of Google Search, the system displayed inaccurate and weird AI hallucinations. These included answers that told people to eat rocks and put glue on their pizza. Google admitted at the time that AI overviews needed some work.\nDespite this negative rollout, it appears Google is just getting started putting AI into Search.\n\ntitle2:\nAlphabet praises DeepSeek, but it's massively ramping up its AI spending\ndescription2:\nBooming AI budgets seemed at risk last week when DeepSeek crashed Nvidia\u2019s stock based on speculation that its cheaper AI models would lower demand for AI chips and data centers.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai has certainly noticed the Chinese AI company, praising its work as \u201ctremendous\u201d in Alphabet\u2019s latest earnings call (while adding that some of Gemini\u2019s models are just as efficient).\nBut just like Meta, Alphabet isn\u2019t throwing down the towel in Big Tech\u2019s AI spending wars. In its latest earnings report, Alphabet announced it would boost capital expenditures to $75 billion this year \u2014 a whopping 42% increase \u2014 to accelerate its AI progress.\nAlphabet is betting that cheaper AI will massively boost demand for its services, rather than making it basically free and threatening its business models. The company noted it stands to benefit from this rise in usage \u2014 known as inference \u2014 thanks to its billions of existing users.\n\u201cPart of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible,\u201d Pichai said during the earnings call. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the opportunity space. It\u2019s as big as it comes, and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing us invest to meet that moment.\u201d\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made similar comments in Meta\u2019s earnings call last week, pledging to spend \u201chundreds of billions\u201d on AI in the long term despite all the DeepSeek buzz.\nWhether this all pans out is unclear, but for now, tech giants can afford the AI bills, and when (or if) they\u2019ll slow down is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\ntitle3:\nSpotify shares pop 13% after company reports first profitable year\ndescription3:\nSpotify's Co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek attends a live recording panel at Acquired, a technology podcast, at the Chase Center in San Francisco, California, U.S., Sept. 10, 2024.\nSpotify shares climbed 13% on Tuesday after the music streaming company recorded its first full year of profitability, closing the fiscal year with 1.14 billion euros in net income.\nHere are the numbers from its fourth-quarter earnings report, compared with analyst expectations:\nRevenue: 4.24 billion euros vs. 4.19 billion euros expected by analysts polled by LSEG\n4.24 billion euros vs. 4.19 billion euros expected by analysts polled by LSEG Earnings per share: 1.76 euros vs.1.99 euros expected by analysts polled by LSEG\n1.76 euros vs.1.99 euros expected by analysts polled by LSEG MAUs (monthly active users): 675 million vs. 664.3 million expected by analysts polled by StreetAccount\nThe Luxembourg-based company reported a 40% growth year over year for gross profit, rising 10% from the previous quarter. Operating income came in at 477 million euros, slightly below guidance.\nThe company said it paid a record $10 billion in royalties to the music industry in 2024, growth that's likely to continue with the streamer's new multiyear publishing agreement with Universal Music Group announced in January.\nThe deal will include new paid subscription tiers, bundles for music and nonmusic content and a direct license between the two companies for Spotify in the U.S. and other countries.\n\ntitle4:\nAMD pulls up the release of its next-gen data center GPUs\ndescription4:\nAMD says that it plans to launch its next major data center GPUs, the AMD Instinct MI350 series, sooner than originally announced.\nDuring the company\u2019s Q4 2024 earnings call Tuesday, AMD CEO Lisa Su said AMD plans to sample the MI350 with \u201clead customers\u201d this quarter and \u201caccelerate\u201d production shipments to \u201cmid-year.\u201d\n\u201cSo, we had previously stated that we thought we would launch [the MI350] in the second half of [2025],\u201d Su said. \u201cAnd frankly, that bring-up has come up better than we expected, and there\u2019s very strong customer demand, so we are actually going to pull that production ramp into the middle of the year, which improves our relative competitiveness.\u201d\nAMD\u2019s data center revenue pales in comparison to rival Nvidia\u2019s, which regularly eclipses tens of billions of dollars per quarter. But AMD has gained ground in the last year, acquiring and retaining customers, including Meta, Microsoft, and IBM.\nAMD says that sales of AMD Instinct chips reached over $5 billion in 2024, and the company expects its data center segment to grow \u201cdouble digits\u201d in 2025. Last year, data center revenue made up around half ($3.9 billion) of AMD\u2019s overall revenue ($7.1 billion), the company reported on Tuesday.\n\u201cI believe that the demand for AI compute is strong,\u201d Su continued. \u201c[MI350] will be a catalyst for the data center GPU business \u2026 We see [the data center] business growing to tens of billions as we go through the next couple of years.\u201d\nInvestors seemed generally pleased with AMD\u2019s fourth-quarter results. The company\u2019s stock was up 4.58% as of publish time.\"\n\nResponse:",
