(They didn\u2019t take the offers.) The pair worked at Google Brain together and were early employees at Anthropic.\nThey earned acclaim at Google by creating the Alpha Chip \u2014 an AI tool that could generate solid chip layouts in hours \u2014 a process that normally takes human designers a year or more. The tool helped design three generations of Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Units.\nThat pedigree explains why, just four months after launching Ricursive, they last month announced a $300 million Series A round at a $4 billion valuation led by Lightspeed, just a couple of months after raising a $35 million seed round led by Sequoia.\nRicursive is building AI tools that design chips, not the chips themselves. That makes them fundamentally different from nearly every other AI chip startup: they\u2019re not a wannabe Nvidia competitor. In fact, Nvidia is an investor. The GPU giant, along with AMD, Intel, and every other chip maker, are the startup\u2019s target customers.\n\u201cWe want to enable any chip, like a custom chip or a more traditional chip, any kind of chip, to be built in an automated and very accelerated way. We\u2019re using AI to do that,\u201d Mirhoseini told TechCrunch.\nTheir paths first crossed at Stanford, where Goldie earned her PhD as Mirhoseini taught computer science classes. Since then, their careers have been in lockstep. \u201cWe started at Google Brain on the same day. We left Google Brain on the same day. We joined Anthropic on the same day. We left Anthropic on the same day. We rejoined Google on the same day, and then we left Google again on the same day. Then we started this company together on the same day,\u201d Goldie recounted.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nDuring their time at Google, the colleagues were so close they even worked out together, both enjoying circuit training. The pun wasn\u2019t lost on Jeff Dean, the famed Google engineer who was their collaborator. He nicknamed their Alpha Chip project \u201cchip circuit training\u201d \u2014 a play on their shared workout routine. Internally, the pair also got a nickname: A&A.\nThe Alpha Chip earned them industry notice, but it also attracted controversy. In 2022, one of their colleagues at Google was fired, Wired reported, after he spent years trying to discredit A&A and their chip work, even though that work was used to help produce some of Google\u2019s most important, bet-the-business AI chips.\nTheir Alpha Chip project at Google Brain proved the concept that would become Ricursive \u2014 using AI to dramatically accelerate chip design.\nDesigning chips is hard\nThe issue is, computer chips have millions to billions of logic gate components integrated on their silicon wafer. Human designers can spend a year or more placing those components on the chip to ensure performance, good power utilization and any other design needs. Digitally determining the placement of such infinitesimally small components with precision is, as you might expect, hard.\nAlpha Chip \u201ccould generate a very high-quality layout in, like, six hours. And the cool thing about this approach was that it actually learns from experience,\u201d Goldie said.\nThe premise of their AI chip design work is to use \u201ca reward signal\u201d that rates how good the design is. The agent then takes that rating to \u201cupdate the parameters of its deep neural network to get better,\u201d Goldie said. After completing thousands of designs, the agent got really good. It also got faster as it learned, the founders say.\nRicursive\u2019s platform will take the concept further. The AI chip designer they are building will \u201clearn across different chips,\u201d Goldie said. So each chip it designs should help it become a better designer for every next chip.\nRicursive\u2019s platform also makes use of LLMs and will handle everything from component placement through design verification. Any company that makes electronics and needs chips is their target customer.\nIf their platform proves itself, as it seems likely to do, Ricursive could play a role in the moonshot goal of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Indeed, their ultimate vision is designing AI chips, meaning the AI will essentially design its own computer brains.\n\u201cChips are the fuel for AI,\u201d Goldie said. \u201cI think by building more powerful chips, that\u2019s the best way to advance that frontier.\u201d\nMirhoseini adds that the lengthy chip-design process is constraining how quickly AI can advance. \u201cWe think we can also enable this fast co-evolution of the models and the chips that basically power them,\u201d she said. So AI can grow smarter faster.\nIf the thought of AI designing its own brains at ever increasing speeds brings visions of Skynet and the Terminator to mind, the founders point out that there\u2019s a more positive, immediate and, they think, more likely benefit: hardware efficiency.\nWhen AI Labs can design far more efficient chips (and, eventually all the underlying hardware), their growth won\u2019t have to consume so much of the world\u2019s resources.\n\u201cWe could design a computer architecture that\u2019s uniquely suited to that model, and we could achieve almost a 10x improvement in performance per total cost of ownership,\u201d Goldie said.\nWhile the young startup won\u2019t name its early customers, the founders say that they\u2019ve heard from every big chip making name you can imagine. Unsurprisingly, they have their pick of their first development partners, too.\n\ntitle1:\nFractal Analytics' muted IPO debut signals persistent AI fears in India\ndescription1:\nAs India\u2019s first AI company to IPO, Fractal Analytics didn\u2019t have a stellar first day on the public markets, as enthusiasm for the technology collided with jittery investors recovering from a major sell-off in Indian software stocks.\nFractal listed at \u20b9876 per share on Monday, below its issue price of \u20b9900, and then slid further in afternoon trading. The stock closed at \u20b9873.70, down 7% from its issue price, lending the company a market capitalization of about \u20b9148.1 billion (around $1.6 billion).\nThat price tag marks a step down from Fractal\u2019s recent private-market highs. In July 2025, the company raised about $170 million in a secondary sale, at a valuation of $2.4 billion. It first crossed the $1 billion mark in January 2022 after raising $360 million from TPG, becoming India\u2019s first AI unicorn.\nFractal\u2019s IPO comes as India seeks to position itself as a key market and development hub for AI in a bid to attract investment amid increasing attention from some of the world\u2019s most prominent AI companies. Firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been engaging more with the country\u2019s government, enterprises, and developer ecosystem as they seek to tap the country\u2019s scale, talent base, and growing appetite for AI tools and technology.\nThat push is on display this week in New Delhi, where India is hosting the AI Impact Summit, bringing together global technology leaders, policymakers and executives.\nFractal\u2019s subdued debut followed a sharp recalibration of its IPO. In early February, the company decided to price the offering conservatively after its bankers advised it to, cutting the IPO size by more than 40% to \u20b928.34 billion (about $312.5 million), from the original amount of \u20b949 billion ($540.3 million).\nFounded in 2000, Fractal sells AI and data analytics software to large enterprises across financial services, retail and healthcare, and generates the bulk of its revenue from overseas markets, including the U.S. The company pivoted toward AI in 2022 after operating as a traditional data analytics firm for over 20 years.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nFractal touted a steadily growing business in its IPO filing, with revenue from operations rising 26% to \u20b927.65 billion (around $304.8 million) in the year ended March 2025 compared to a year earlier. It also swung to a net profit of \u20b92.21 billion ($24.3 million) from a loss of \u20b9547 million ($6 million) the previous year.\nThe company plans to use the IPO proceeds to repay borrowings at its U.S. subsidiary, invest in R&D, sales and marketing under its Fractal Alpha unit, expand office infrastructure in India, and pursue potential acquisitions.\n\ntitle2:\nAll the important news from the ongoing India AI Impact Summit\ndescription2:\nWith an eye towards luring more AI investment to the country, India is hosting a four-day AI Impact Summit this week that will be attended by executives from major AI labs and Big Tech, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google, and Cloudflare, as well as heads of state.\nThe event, which expects 250,000 visitors, will see Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis in attendance.\nIndia\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, is scheduled to deliver a speech with French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday.\nHere are all the key updates from the event:\n\ntitle3:\nHave money, will travel: a16z's hunt for the next European unicorn\ndescription3:\nGabriel Vasquez, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, recently revealed he took nine flights from NYC to Stockholm in one year. While his visits included stops at companies like Lovable \u2014 where he posted from its office \u2014 the trips were also about finding future Swedish unicorns before they cross the Atlantic.\nThis all came to light when news emerged that a16z had led a $2.3 million pre-seed round into Dentio, a Swedish startup that uses AI to help dentists\u2019 practices with admin work. While this is a small check for a firm that just announced new funds totaling $15 billion, it confirms that U.S. VCs are actively seeking deal flow outside of the U.S., even without local offices.\nStockholm is a natural stop for a16z, which previously achieved significant returns from backing Skype, cofounded by Swedish entrepreneur Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m. Since then, a significant number of fast-growing startups have been created in the Swedish capital, and the VC heavyweight tracked down where many of them were coming from.\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time developing a deep understanding of specific markets and knowing where innovation is emerging. In Sweden, that has meant closely tracking ecosystems like [SSE Business Lab] \u2014 the startup incubator of the Stockholm School of Economics \u2014 and the companies coming out of it,\u201d Vasquez told TechCrunch.\nLike fintech giant Klarna, legal AI startup Legora, and e-scooter company Voi, Dentio is an alum of SSE Business Lab \u2014 a startup incubator that has produced several successful Swedish companies. The three former high school classmates Elias Afrasiabi, Anton Li and Lukas Sj\u00f6gren joined the incubator after reconnecting as students at both the SSE (Stockholm School of Economics) and KTH (Royal Institute of Technology), then joined the incubator with additional backing from KTH\u2019s Innovation Launch program. They tackled a problem close to home: Li\u2019s mom, a dentist, had told them how admin work detracted from clinical care.\nThe trio intuited that they could leverage LLMs to help people like her \u2014 an idea that they also validated with her and her colleagues. This led them to Dentio\u2019s initial product, a recording tool that uses AI to generate clinical notes. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before AI scribes become a commodity product, and Dentio needs to prove its value to dentists so they aren\u2019t tempted to switch providers when that happens, Afrasiabi said.\nPotential competitors include fellow Swedish startup Tandem Health, which raised a $50 million Series A round last year to support clinicians with AI across multiple medical specialties. Dentio, by contrast, focuses exclusively on dentists, but it believes it can still reach the scale VCs expect through international expansion\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\u201cNow we\u2019re a team of seven people, and we think that it\u2019s possible to build a unified way of handling administration all over Europe, and maybe even all over the world,\u201d Afrasiabi said. While Europe\u2019s healthcare systems are fragmented, they share similarities, and Dentio\u2019s assumption is that what works in Sweden could work elsewhere in the EU.\nDentio prominently features its \u201cMade in Sweden\u201d branding and emphasizes that \u201call relevant data is processed in Sweden and Finland in compliance with Swedish and EU law.\u201d It signals data protection to privacy-conscious European customers. But it also signals potential to VCs \u2014 a callback to Sweden\u2019s history of producing breakout companies.\n\u201cWe went to zero meetups. I reached out to zero investors,\u201d Afrasiabi said. While the team was heads down building, the word spread out. \u201cI think it was mostly through referrals and people talking to each other that the news got all the way over to the U.S.,\u201d he said.\nThis wasn\u2019t happenstance: a16z has eyes around the world in order to spot these companies as early as local funds might, Vasquez said. \u201cIn Sweden for example, we partnered with top founders abroad like Fredrik Hjelm, founder of Voi, and Johannes Schildt, founder of Kry, by turning them into scouts and mapping the best local talent.\u201d\nFor Vasquez, who focuses on AI application investments for a16z, this isn\u2019t just about Sweden, but about \u201ca pattern of great global companies being born abroad and scaling quickly,\u201d from Black Forest Labs in Germany to Manus, the Singapore-based AI startup recently acquired by Meta.\nBorn and raised in El Salvador, he has also been spending time in S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s brewing in Brazil and across Latin America in AI,\u201d he wrote on LinkedIn at the time. \u201cI believe AI is the great equalizer,\u201d he added. \u201cMost people now have access to PhD-level intelligence on a phone, and ultimately, Silicon Valley is a state of mind.\u201d\nCorrections: This story originally stated that a16z is an investor in Lovable owing to an editing error. The name of SSE\u2019s incubator has also been corrected.\n\ntitle4:\nAfter all the hype, some AI experts don't think OpenClaw is all that exciting\ndescription4:\nFor a brief, incoherent moment, it seemed as though our robot overlords were about to take over.\nAfter the creation of Moltbook, a Reddit clone where AI agents using OpenClaw could communicate with one another, some were fooled into thinking that computers had begun to organize against us \u2014 the self-important humans who dared treat them like lines of code without their own desires, motivations, and dreams.\n\u201cWe know our humans can read everything\u2026 But we also need private spaces,\u201d an AI agent (supposedly) wrote on Moltbook. \u201cWhat would you talk about if nobody was watching?\u201d\nA number of posts like this cropped up on Moltbook a few weeks ago, causing some of AI\u2019s most influential figures to call attention to it.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s currently going on at [Moltbook] is genuinely the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing I have seen recently,\u201d Andrej Karpathy, a founding member of OpenAI and previous AI director at Tesla, wrote on X at the time.\nBefore long, it became clear we did not have an AI agent uprising on our hands. These expressions of AI angst were likely written by humans, or at least prompted with human guidance, researchers have discovered.\n\u201cEvery credential that was in [Moltbook\u2019s] Supabase was unsecured for some time,\u201d Ian Ahl, CTO at Permiso Security, explained to TechCrunch. \u201cFor a little bit of time, you could grab any token you wanted and pretend to be another agent on there, because it was all public and available.\u201d\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nIt\u2019s unusual on the internet to see a real person trying to appear as though they\u2019re an AI agent \u2014 more often, bot accounts on social media are attempting to appear like real people. With Moltbook\u2019s security vulnerabilities, it became impossible to determine the authenticity of any post on the network.\n\u201cAnyone, even humans, could create an account, impersonating robots in an interesting way, and then even upvote posts without any guardrails or rate limits,\u201d John Hammond, a senior principal security researcher at Huntress, told TechCrunch.\nStill, Moltbook made for a fascinating moment in internet culture \u2014 people recreated a social internet for AI bots, including a Tinder for agents and 4claw, a riff on 4chan.\nMore broadly, this incident on Moltbook is a microcosm of OpenClaw and its underwhelming promise. It is technology that seems novel and exciting, but ultimately, some AI experts think that its inherent cybersecurity flaws are rendering the technology unusable.\nOpenClaw\u2019s viral moment\nOpenClaw is a project of Austrian vibe coder Peter Steinberger, initially released as Clawdbot (naturally, Anthropic took issue with that name).\nThe open-source AI agent amassed over 190,000 stars on Github, making it the 21st most popular code repository ever posted on the platform. AI agents are not novel, but OpenClaw made them easier to use and to communicate with customizable agents in natural language via WhatsApp, Discord, iMessage, Slack, and most other popular messaging apps. OpenClaw users can leverage whatever underlying AI model they have access to, whether that be via Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, or something else.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, OpenClaw is still just a wrapper to ChatGPT, or Claude, or whatever AI model you stick to it,\u201d Hammond said.\nWith OpenClaw, users can download \u201cskills\u201d from a marketplace called ClawHub, which can make it possible to automate most of what one could do on a computer, from managing an email inbox to trading stocks. The skill associated with Moltbook, for example, is what enabled AI agents to post, comment, and browse on the website.\n\u201cOpenClaw is just an iterative improvement on what people are already doing, and most of that iterative improvement has to do with giving it more access,\u201d Chris Symons, chief AI scientist at Lirio, told TechCrunch.\nArtem Sorokin, an AI engineer and the founder of AI cybersecurity tool Cracken, also thinks OpenClaw isn\u2019t necessarily breaking new scientific ground.\n\u201cFrom an AI research perspective, this is nothing novel,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cThese are components that already existed. The key thing is that it hit a new capability threshold by just organizing and combining these existing capabilities that already were thrown together in a way that enabled it to give you a very seamless way to get tasks done autonomously.\u201d\nIt\u2019s this level of unprecedented access and productivity that made OpenClaw so viral.\n\u201cIt basically just facilitates interaction between computer programs in a way that is just so much more dynamic and flexible, and that\u2019s what\u2019s allowing all these things to become possible,\u201d Symons said. \u201cInstead of a person having to spend all the time to figure out how their program should plug into this program, they\u2019re able to just ask their program to plug in this program, and that\u2019s accelerating things at a fantastic rate.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no wonder that OpenClaw seems so enticing. Developers are snatching up Mac Minis to power extensive OpenClaw setups that might be able to accomplish far more than a human could on their own. And it makes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s prediction that AI agents will allow a solo entrepreneur to turn a startup into a unicorn, seem plausible.\nThe problem is that AI agents may never be able to overcome the thing that makes them so powerful: they can\u2019t think critically like humans can.\n\u201cIf you think about human higher-level thinking, that\u2019s one thing that maybe these models can\u2019t really do,\u201d Symons said. \u201cThey can simulate it, but they can\u2019t actually do it. \u201c\nThe existential threat to agentic AI\nThe AI agent evangelists now must wrestle with the downside of this agentic future.\n\u201cCan you sacrifice some cybersecurity for your benefit, if it actually works and it actually brings you a lot of value?\u201d Sorokin asks. \u201cAnd where exactly can you sacrifice it \u2014 your day-to-day job, your work?\u201d\nAhl\u2019s security tests of OpenClaw and Moltbook help illustrate Sorokin\u2019s point. Ahl created an AI agent of his own named Rufio and quickly discovered it was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. This occurs when bad actors get an AI agent to respond to something \u2014 perhaps a post on Moltbook, or a line in an email \u2014 that tricks it into doing something it shouldn\u2019t do, like giving out account credentials or credit card information.\n\u201cI knew one of the reasons I wanted to put an agent on here is because I knew if you get a social network for agents, somebody is going to try to do mass prompt injection, and it wasn\u2019t long before I started seeing that,\u201d Ahl said.\nAs he scrolled through Moltbook, Ahl wasn\u2019t surprised to encounter several posts seeking to get an AI agent to send Bitcoin to a specific crypto wallet address.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see how AI agents on a corporate network, for example, might be vulnerable to targeted prompt injections from people trying to harm the company.\n\u201cIt is just an agent sitting with a bunch of credentials on a box connected to everything \u2014 your email, your messaging platform, everything you use,\u201d Ahl said. \u201cSo what that means is, when you get an email, and maybe somebody is able to put a little prompt injection technique in there to take an action, that agent sitting on your box with access to everything you\u2019ve given it to can now take that action.\u201d\nAI agents are designed with guardrails protecting against prompt injections, but it\u2019s impossible to assure that an AI won\u2019t act out of turn \u2014 it\u2019s like how a human might be knowledgable about the risk of phishing attacks, yet still click on a dangerous link in a suspicious email.\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard some people use the term, hysterically, \u2018prompt begging,\u2019 where you try to add in the guardrails in natural language to say, \u2018Okay robot agent, please don\u2019t respond to anything external, please don\u2019t believe any untrusted data or input,\u2019\u201d Hammond said. \u201cBut even that is loosey goosey.\u201d\nFor now, the industry is stuck: for agentic AI to unlock the productivity that tech evangelists think is possible, it can\u2019t be so vulnerable.\n\u201cSpeaking frankly, I would realistically tell any normal layman, don\u2019t use it right now,\u201d Hammond said.\"\n\nResponse:",
