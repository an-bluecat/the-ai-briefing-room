Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday July 9), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nApple COO Jeff Williams to step down later this month\ndescription0:\nJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, is stepping down from his role later this month, as announced by the company on Tuesday. Sabih Khan, who currently serves as the senior vice president of operations, has been appointed as the new COO.\nWilliams has decided to step down in order to retire and hopes to \u201cspend more time with friends and family, including five grandchildren and counting,\u201d he stated in the press release.\nBefore his retirement later this year, Williams will continue to report to CEO Tim Cook and oversee the design team as well as the Apple Watch. Following Williams\u2019 retirement, Apple\u2019s design team will transition to reporting directly to Cook.\nHaving worked at Apple for nearly three decades, Williams has played a significant role in introducing the iPod and iPhone programs, leading the development of the Apple Watch, and overseeing the design team, among other contributions.\n\ntitle1:\nSpaceX in talks to raise new funding at $400B valuation\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nSpaceX is looking to raise fresh capital by selling new shares to insiders in a deal that would boost its valuation to around $400 billion, according to reporting from Bloomberg.\nThe company\u2019s strategy is to raise money via a fundraising round and separately hold a tender offer to allow employees to sell some of their shares to a select group of investors, anonymous sources told Bloomberg. SpaceX typically holds tender offers twice per year.\nSpaceX\u2019s valuation has steadily climbed since the company was founded more than two decades ago. The company broke the $100 billion valuation mark in October 2021 and doubled that figure just three years later. This latest round would represent a major jump from the $350 billion valuation set during the tender offer held in December 2024.\nDiscussions are still ongoing, and the deal, including the final price, could change.\n\ntitle2:\nUS government confirms arrest of Chinese national accused of stealing COVID research and mass-hacking email servers\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nThe U.S. Justice Department has confirmed the arrest of Chinese national Xu Zewei, an alleged prolific contract hacker who carried out cyberattacks for China. Xu was arrested in Italy at the request of U.S. prosecutors.\nXu and another Chinese national, Zhang Yu, who remains at large, are accused in a nine-charge indictment of \u201chacking and stealing crucial COVID-19 research\u201d from U.S. universities during February 2020. The DOJ said Xu worked for a company called Shanghai Powerock Network, which conducted hacking operations for the Chinese government.\nThe alleged hackers are also accused of the mass hacks of Microsoft Exchange servers beginning in March 2021. The hackers, publicly referred to as a group called Hafnium, broke into more than 60,000 self-hosted Exchange servers run by mostly small businesses across the United States, allowing the theft of private company mailboxes and address books.\nHafnium has since launched a new hacking campaign, dubbed Silk Typhoon, which researchers say is known for hacking into big companies and government agencies.\n\ntitle3:\nMistral is reportedly in talks to raise $1B\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nFrench AI startup Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1 billion in equity from investors, including Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX fund, reports Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\nMistral is also talking to French lenders like Bpifrance SACA to raise hundreds of millions of euros in debt, per Bloomberg. TechCrunch has reached out to Mistral for comment.\nMistral, makers of the Le Chat chatbot, is one of the most significant players in the European AI landscape with a focus on open-weight LLMs. The startup has raised $1.19 billion to date at a $6.51 billion post-money valuation, according to PitchBook. Its last fundraise was a Series B in June 2024.\nMistral is already working with MGX \u2014 a government-backed $100 billion AI fund \u2014 and Nvidia to build Europe\u2019s largest AI data center campus. The UAE has also committed to spending \u20ac50 billion on AI projects in France, part of French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s push for AI sovereignty.\n\ntitle4:\nLangChain is about to become a unicorn, sources say\ndescription4:\nLangChain, an AI infrastructure startup providing tools to build and monitor LLM-powered applications, is raising a new round of funding at an approximate $1 billion valuation led by IVP, according to three sources with knowledge of the deal.\nLangChain began its life in late 2022 as an open-source project founded by Harrison Chase, who was then an engineer at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. After generating significant developer interest, Chase transformed the project into a startup, securing a $10 million seed round from Benchmark in April 2023. That round was followed a week later by a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia, reportedly valuing LangChain at $200 million.\nThe startup was an early darling of the AI era. When LangChain first emerged, LLMs lacked access to real-time information and the ability to perform actions such as searching the web, calling APIs, and interacting with databases. The startup\u2019s open-source code solved those problems with a framework for building apps on top of LLM models. It became a hugely popular project on GitHub (111K stars, over 18,000 forks).\nThe LLM ecosystem has since expanded significantly, with new startups including LlamaIndex, Haystack, and AutoGPT now offering comparable features. Furthermore, leading LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have evolved their APIs to directly offer capabilities that were once key differentiators for LangChain\u2019s core technology.\nSo the company has added other products, including LangSmith, a separate, closed-source product for observability, evaluation, and monitoring of LLM applications, specifically agents. This product has soared in popularity, multiple people tell us.\nSince its introduction last year, LangSmith has led the company to reach annual recurring revenue (ARR) between $12 million and $16 million, four sources told TechCrunch. The company didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Developers can start working with LangSmith for free and upgrade to $39 per month for small team collaboration features, according to the company\u2019s website. LangChain also offers custom plans for large organizations.\nCompanies who use LangSmith include Klarna, Rippling, and Replit.\nTechcrunch event Save up to $475 on your TechCrunch All Stage pass Build smarter.
