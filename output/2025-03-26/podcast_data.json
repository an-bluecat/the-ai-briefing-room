    "Generate_script_prompt": "\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing as an example.\n        Response: I'm Wall-E, and this is your CNBC techcheck Briefing for Monday April 29th. Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Thursday March 27), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nNvidia is reportedly in talks to acquire Lepton AI\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nNvidia is looking to get into the server rental market.\nThe semiconductor giant is reportedly nearing a deal to acquire Lepton AI, a company that rents out servers that are powered by Nvidia\u2019s AI chips, according to The Information. Citing unnamed sources, the outlet says the deal deal is worth several hundred million dollars.\nTechCrunch reached out to Nvidia for more information.\nLepton AI was founded two years ago and raised an $11 million seed round in May 2023 from CRV and Fusion Fund. The other big player in the server rental market is Together AI, a startup that has raised more than $500 million in venture capital despite only being about a year older than Lepton.\nNvidia reportedly acquired synthetic data startup Gretel last week.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI's viral Studio Ghibli moment highlights AI copyright concerns\ndescription1:\nIt\u2019s only been a day since ChatGPT\u2019s new AI image generator went live, and social media feeds are already flooded with AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the cult-favorite Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d and \u201cSpirited Away.\u201d\nIn the last 24 hours, we\u2019ve seen AI-generated images representing Studio Ghibli versions of Elon Musk, \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201c, and President Donald Trump. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even seems to have made his new profile picture a Studio Ghibli-style image, presumably made with GPT-4o\u2019s native image generator. Users seem to be uploading existing images and pictures into ChatGPT and asking the chatbot to re-create it in new styles.\nOpenAI\u2019s latest update comes on the heels of Google\u2019s release of a similar AI image feature in its Gemini Flash model, which also sparked a viral moment earlier in March when people used it to remove watermarks from images.\nOpenAI\u2019s and Google\u2019s latest tools make it easier than ever to re-create the styles of copyrighted works \u2014 simply by typing a text prompt. Together, these new AI image features seem to reignite concerns at the core of several lawsuits against generative AI model developers. If these companies are training on copyrighted works, are they violating copyright law?\nAccording to Evan Brown, an intellectual property lawyer at the law firm Neal & McDevitt, products like GPT-4o\u2019s native image generator operate in a legal gray area today. Style is not explicitly protected by copyright, according to Brown, meaning OpenAI does not appear to be breaking the law simply by generating images that look like Studio Ghibli movies.\nHowever, Brown says it\u2019s plausible that OpenAI achieved this likeness by training its model on millions of frames from Ghibli\u2019s films. Even if that was the case, several courts are still deciding whether training AI models on copyrighted works falls under fair use protections.\n\u201cI think this raises the same question that we\u2019ve been asking ourselves for a couple years now,\u201d said Brown in an interview. \u201cWhat are the copyright infringement implications of going out, crawling the web, and copying into these databases?\u201d\nThe New York Times and several publishers are in active lawsuits against OpenAI, claiming the company trained its AI models on copyrighted works without proper attribution or payment. There have been similar claims brought in lawsuits against other leading AI companies, including Meta and AI image-generation startup Midjourney.\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, an OpenAI spokesperson says that while ChatGPT refuses to replicate \u201cthe style of individual living artists,\u201d OpenAI does permit it to replicate \u201cbroader studio styles.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s worth noting there are living artists who are credited with pioneering their studio\u2019s unique styles, such as Studio Ghibli\u2019s co-founder, Hayao Miyazaki.\nEvidently, users have also been able to use GPT-4o\u2019s native image-generation feature to re-create styles from other studios and artists. Someone else made a Marc Andreessen portrait in the style of Dr. Seuss, and a married couple re-created their wedding photos in the style of Pixar.\nstudio ghibli is out, dr seuss is in pic.twitter.com/4ECxwLLkoj \u2014 Jordi Hays (@jordihays) March 26, 2025\nWe tested several popular AI image generators \u2014 including ones available in Google\u2019s Gemini, xAI\u2019s Grok, and Playground.ai \u2014 to see their ability to match Studio Ghibli\u2019s style. We found OpenAI\u2019s new image generator created the most accurate replica of the animation studio\u2019s style.\nA real dog (Left) and an AI-generated image of a dog ChatGPT made in Studio Ghibli style (right). Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff/openAI\nFor now, OpenAI\u2019s and Google\u2019s new image features present a leap forward in what AI models can generate, which seems to be driving a surge in usage. OpenAI delayed the rollout of its new image tool to free-tier users on Wednesday, citing high demand. That may be the most important thing for these companies today, but we\u2019ll have to wait for the courts to weigh in on their legality.\n\ntitle2:\nChatGPT's new AI image feature is delayed for free users\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced on Wednesday that the rollout of ChatGPT\u2019s viral new AI image features to free users would be delayed, citing significantly higher demand than the company expected.\n\u201cImages in ChatGPT are wayyyy more popular than we expected (and we had pretty high expectations),\u201d Altman said in a post on X on Wednesday.\nOn Tuesday, the company announced the launch of GPT-4o\u2019s native image generation, which lets users upload and modify images, saying it would soon come to all tiers of ChatGPT. As of Wednesday, OpenAI has only rolled out the feature to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro, Plus, and Teams.\nIn recent months, OpenAI has faced similar hiccups around product launches, repeatedly blaming a lack of compute capacity. Shortly after launching Sora in December, OpenAI disabled signups. Perhaps, the company\u2019s planned $500 billion Stargate data center project will help with those capacity constraints.\n\ntitle3:\nIsland lands $250M in funding at a $4.8B valuation\ndescription3:\nEnterprise browser startup Island just raised a sizable funding round \u2014 one that bumps up its valuation significantly, and less than one year after its last fundraise.\nDallas-based Island raised $250 million in a Series E round led by Coatue that valued the company at $4.85 billion, the startup announced today. This brings the company\u2019s total funding to $730 million. Other backers in the round include Insight Partners, Sequoia, and Canapi Ventures, among others.\nIsland builds online browsers that are designed for enterprises and are meant to be more secure than traditional commercial search engines. They also have universal application access control, device visibility and management, and application automation, among other features.\nThis Series E round marks a notable step up for the nearly 5-year-old company. It raised $175 million in a Series D round that valued the company at $2.9 billion just 11 months ago, co-led by Sequoia and Coatue.\nAt the time, Sequoia partner Doug Leone told TechCrunch that he was attracted to the company right off the bat due to Island\u2019s team and unique value proposition.\n\u201cThe two founders, one of whom was a technical founder out of Israel \u2014 Dan Amiga \u2014 and one who was a very senior security executive out of the U.S. \u2014 Mike Fey \u2014 had a vision that if you could produce a browser based on Chromium that looks like a standard browser to the consumer employee in a corporation but was secure, it would stop bad guys from doing a whole bunch of things,\u201d Leone told TechCrunch at the time.\nEnterprises are clearly buying into the mission, too, as the company now counts 450 customers, among them Mattress Firm, Swiss Life, and Fiverr.\nTechCrunch reached out to Island for more information.\n\ntitle4:\nSpaceX reportedly has a secret backdoor for Chinese investment\ndescription4:\nElon Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX has allowed Chinese investors to buy stakes as long as the funds are routed through the Cayman Islands or other offshore hubs, according to reporting from ProPublica.\nSpaceX is a defense contractor for the Pentagon, one that handles sensitive work like building a classified spy satellite network. Investment from China raises national security concerns, as it could grant a foreign adversary access to sensitive military technology, intelligence, or supply chains.\nThe insight into SpaceX\u2019s investment approach surfaces new questions around Musk\u2019s own ties with China, particularly amid reports that the Pentagon briefed Musk on a potential war with China. The billionaire executive who is leading the charge to gut federal spending has regularly met with Communist Party officials in China to discuss his business interests. Tesla\u2019s Shanghai gigafactory builds about half of Tesla\u2019s cars, and the country makes up a significant (if shrinking) chunk of its sales.\nThe details of how SpaceX allows Chinese investors to buy into the company came to light through the testimony of its CFO, Bret Johnsen, and major investor Iqbaljit Kahlon during a recent corporate dispute in Delaware.\nThe dispute centered around an aborted 2021 deal with a Chinese firm that had planned to buy $50 million of the company\u2019s stock. When the news became public, SpaceX executives pulled out to avoid potential problems with national security regulators.\nKahlon testified in December that SpaceX finds it \u201cacceptable\u201d for Chinese investors to buy into the company through offshore vehicles, which are often used to keep investors anonymous.\nExperts who spoke to ProPublica said this practice is troubling because it\u2019s a potential sign that the company is taking active steps to conceal foreign ownership interests. It\u2019s unclear exactly why SpaceX does this; the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhile passive, noncontrolling stakes from foreign investors are welcome, it is the Trump administration\u2019s position that adversaries like China use concealed investment strategies to obtain technologies, IP, and leverage in strategic industries. As a result, typically such investments would be vetted by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).\nThere\u2019s no public record of SpaceX undergoing a formal CFIUS review. TechCrunch has reached out to CFIUS and SpaceX to learn more.\nProPublica\u2019s reporting follows an investigation from the Financial Times that found that Chinese investors are using special-purpose vehicles to quietly funnel millions into Musk-controlled companies, including SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink.\"\n\nResponse:",
