Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Wednesday February 26), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nBrex eyes $500M in revenue as it adds the likes of Anthropic and Robinhood as customers\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nFintech Brex expects its annual net revenue to reach $500 million in 2025, according to a person familiar with the company\u2019s operations as cited by Bloomberg and The Information.\nWhile the startup did not comment on the specific revenue projection, it did share that Brex has seen \u201c3x overall revenue growth\u201d year-over-year. It also told TechCrunch that it has grown its enterprise business by 80% year-over-year. Brex says it now counts over 150 public companies as customers, including Anthropic, Arm, Robinhood, ServiceTitan, Sonos, and Wiz.\nCEO and co-founder Pedro Franceschi told TechCrunch in 2024 that he expected the company to be cash-flow positive by 2025. At that time, he said that an IPO would soon follow the company turning a profit but that it had to \u201cget there first.\u201d\nThe startup has brought in over $1.5 billion in both primary and secondary transactions and was valued at over $12.3 billion at its peak in 2022.\nWant to reach out with a tip?

The company also rolled out Gemini Code Assist for GitHub, a code review \u201cagent\u201d designed to automatically look for bugs in code and offer suggestions directly within GitHub.\nCode Assist for individuals lets developers use a chat window to talk in natural language with a Google AI model that can access and edit their codebase. Much like GitHub\u2019s popular Copilot tool, Gemini Code Assist for individuals can fix bugs, complete sections of code, or explain parts of the codebase that don\u2019t make sense.\nGoogle\u2019s AI coding assistant uses a variant of the company\u2019s Gemini 2.0 AI model that\u2019s been fine-tuned for coding applications. Gemini Code Assist for individuals can integrate with popular coding environments such as VS Code and JetBrains via plugins, and works across many popular programming languages.\nImage Credits:Google\nNotably, Code Assist for individuals offers 180,000 code completions a month, which is 90 times the usage cap of the free GitHub Copilot plan (2,000 code completions a month). Code Assist for individuals also comes with 240 chat requests a day, close to 5 times the number of requests the free GitHub Copilot plan offers.\nThe model powering Code Assist for individuals has a 128,000-token context window, which Google says is over four times larger than what the competition offers. That means the model can take in more code in a single prompt, allowing it to reason over more complicated codebases.\nDevelopers can sign up for the free public preview of Gemini Code Assist for individuals beginning Tuesday.\nAs for Gemini Code Assist for GitHub, it automatically scans pull requests to look for bugs and offers additional possibly helpful recommendations.\nThe two tools arrive as Google ramps up its efforts to compete with Microsoft and its subsidiary, GitHub, in the developer tools space. Seven months ago, Google hired Ryan Salva, who previously led the GitHub Copilot team, to spearhead Google\u2019s work on developer tooling.\nBy offering a free AI coding assistant with very high usage caps, Google hopes to steer developers early in their careers toward Code Assist, Salva told TechCrunch in an interview. Salva expects at least a few of those developers to someday upgrade to an enterprise Code Assist plan, which is where Google will make its money.\nGoogle has been selling Gemini Code Assist to businesses for about a year. The company announced in December that the AI coding assistant would soon integrate with third-party tools from GitLab, GitHub, and Google Docs. Enterprise Code Assist tiers add features like audit logs, integration with other Google Cloud products, and customization for private repositories.\n\ntitle2:\nOpenAI rolls out deep research to paying ChatGPT users\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nOpenAI announced on Tuesday that it\u2019s rolling out deep research, its web browsing agent that creates thorough research reports, to all paying ChatGPT users.\nChatGPT Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu subscribers will get 10 deep research queries per month. OpenAI\u2019s Deep research was previously only available to ChatGPT Pro users, the company\u2019s $200-a-month tier; they now get 120 deep research queries a month, up from 100 at launch.\nOpenAI, Google, and Perplexity are racing to put their competing deep research products \u2014 which all have basically the same name and generate long reports \u2014 in the hands of more users. Google rolled out its deep research agent to all Gemini Advanced users last week.\nTech companies hope deep research tools help people see value in their pricey AI subscriptions. Though OpenAI notes it needs to do more testing around how these agents could be used to persuade people.\n\ntitle3:\nWhat to expect from Amazon's Alexa event on Wednesday\ndescription3:\nAmazon is hosting an Alexa-focused press event in NYC on Wednesday. Considering the company hasn\u2019t held a major device presser in nearly two years \u2014 the last one was in September 2023 \u2014 we\u2019re expecting some splashy announcements.\nThe event will not be livestreamed. However, TechCrunch will be reporting on the ground. The festivities, emceed by Amazon\u2019s new devices and services chief Panos Panay, formerly of Microsoft Surface fame, are scheduled to start at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe stakes are high for Amazon, which has reportedly lost billions of dollars on its Alexa business despite selling hundreds of millions of devices. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is said to have pushed the company\u2019s hardware team to find ways to boost profits through monetized subscriptions, fees, and other add-on services.\nWe may hear about one of those subscriptions on Wednesday.\nAmazon reportedly plans to introduce an upgraded Alexa experience, code-named Remarkable Alexa, designed to make interactions with the assistant feel more natural and intuitive, along the lines of ChatGPT. Priced between $5 and $10 a month, the enhanced Alexa is said to be able to respond to multiple requests in a single command and even take actions autonomously.\nAmazon teased some of this functionality back in 2023 during its last tentpole devices event. The company promised the upcoming Alexa experience would be compatible with existing devices and draw on generative AI technologies to take into account the context of requests and personalize its responses.\nImproved smart home capabilities could be in tow with the new Alexa, as well. The Verge reports that multiple companies are working on integrations with the new Alexa using developer tools that Amazon announced in 2023. Back then, Amazon said it was collaborating with brands, including iRobot and Philips, on features to simplify scene controls and allow Alexa to better understand what users might want their devices to do.\nA big question is whether the new, generative AI-infused Alexa will be able to overcome some of the underlying tech\u2019s more glaring flaws. According to reporting late last year, the new Alexa at one point struggled with basic commands like switching smart lights off and on.\nThanks to its tendency to get things wrong on occasion and hallucinate, today\u2019s generative AI is typically less reliable than the more rigid systems that make up Alexa\u2019s current technical scaffolding. The upgraded Alexa\u2019s many delays have given Amazon ample time to address the worst potential blunders, but there\u2019s always an element of unpredictability.\nFortunately, the new Alexa won\u2019t be a mandatory upgrade. Reports suggest that Amazon will allow device owners to stick with the \u201cClassic Alexa\u201d experience if they choose.\nAs for when they\u2019ll be presented with that choice, it may be a little while. According to The Washington Post, the launch of the upgraded Alexa was delayed earlier this month after the assistant gave incorrect answers to several test questions. Sources told the publication that it may not roll out until the end of March or later.\n\ntitle4:\nApple shareholders vote down anti-DEI proposal\ndescription4:\nIn Brief\nApple shareholders rejected an anti-DEI proposal at its investor meeting Tuesday.\nThe proposal was brought by a conservative group called the National Center for Public Policy Research. It asked Apple to end its DEI activities. Boards typically ask shareholders to reject shareholder proposals, and this was one of four such shareholder proposals.\nThis proposal gained national attention, however, because Apple\u2019s recommendation against it comes as other tech companies are trimming or eliminating their DEI programs. DEI has come under social and legal fire in the past year, exacerbated by the Trump administration\u2019s less-than-favorable look on the premise.\nMeta eliminated its DEI programs, while Amazon said it would curb some efforts, and Google announced it would ditch diversity hiring goals and conduct a review of its internal DEI programs.\nHowever, CEO Tim Cook warned at the meeting that \u201cas the legal landscape around these issues evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply,\u201d Reuters reported.\"\n\nResponse:",
