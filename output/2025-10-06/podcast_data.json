Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content.

It is everything you need to build, deploy, and optimize agent workflows with way less friction,\u201d Altman said.\nThe launch highlights OpenAI\u2019s push to increase developer adoption by making agent building faster and easier. It also signals a competitive move against other AI platforms racing to offer integrated tools for building autonomous agents for enterprises that can perform complex tasks, not just respond to prompts.\nAgentKit was one of several announcements at OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day, including the launch of the ability to build apps directly inside ChatGPT, which has hit 800 million weekly active users.\nAgentKit includes a few core capabilities. The first is Agent Builder, which Altman described as like Canva for building agents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fast, visual way to design the logic, steps, ideas,\u201d Altman said. \u201cIt\u2019s built on top of the responses API that hundreds of thousands of developers already use.\u201d\nThe second capability of AgentKit is ChatKit, which provides a simple embeddable chat interface that developers can use to bring chat experiences into their own apps.\n\u201cYou can bring your own brand, your own workflows, whatever makes your own product unique,\u201d Altman said.\nEvals for Agents introduces tools to measure AI agent performance, including step-by-step trace grading, datasets for assessing individual agent components, automated prompt optimization, and the ability to run evaluations on external models directly from the OpenAI platform.\nFinally, AgentKit includes access to OpenAI\u2019s connector registry, so developers can securely connect agents to internal tools and third-party systems through an \u201cadmin control panel\u201d while maintaining security and control.\nTo prove how easy it is to use AgentKit, Christina Huang, an OpenAI engineer, built an entire AI workflow and two AI agents live onstage in under eight minutes.\n\u201cThis is all the stuff that we wished we had when we were trying to build our first agents,\u201d Altman said, noting that OpenAI has already signed on several launch partners that have already scaled agents using AgentKit.\n\ntitle1:\nSam Altman says ChatGPT has hit 800M weekly active users\ndescription1:\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Monday that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users, marking an increase of adoption among consumers, developers, enterprises, and governments.\nChatGPT\u2019s impressive growth comes as OpenAI is on a race to secure as many AI chips and build as much AI infrastructure as possible. In August, OpenAI said it was on the cusp of reaching 700 million weekly active users, already an increase from 500 million weekly active users at the end of March.\n\u201cToday, 4 million developers have built with OpenAI,\u201d Altman said. \u201cMore than 800 million people use ChatGPT every week, and we process over 6 billion tokens per minute on the API. Thanks to all of you, AI has gone from something people play with to something people build with every day.\u201d\nAltman made the announcement during the keynote presentation for OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day, which also included announcements for new tools for building apps inside of ChatGPT as well as constructing more complex agentic systems.\n\u201cThis will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive, and personalized, that you can chat with,\u201d Altman said.\nLaunched in November 2022, ChatGPT saw unprecedented user growth almost immediately, becoming both the preeminent consumer AI product and one of the fastest-growing online services ever. More recently the tool expanded into proactive services with OpenAI Pulse, sending customized morning briefs to participating users. The service has also been dogged by concerns about sycophancy and AI-induced delusions, particularly in the recent case of Allan Brooks, who was misled into believing he\u2019d made a novel mathematical discovery with ChatGPT\u2019s help.\nStill legally designated as a nonprofit, OpenAI became the most valuable privately held company in the world on Thursday, after a private stock sale of $6.6 billion in shares valued the company at $500 billion. The company has also been launching new products at a blistering pace, releasing a new version of its video-generation tool Sora last week, paired with an accompanying social media network. That same week, the company partnered with Stripe to launch a platform for agentic commerce.\n\ntitle3:\nMicrosoft buys another 100 MW of solar, this time in Japan\ndescription3:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft is buying 100 megawatts of solar capacity from Japanese developer Shizen Energy, the latest in a string of renewable energy deals designed to power the tech company\u2019s growing compute needs.\nThe agreement, which the companies announced late last week, covers four different solar developments; one is already operating and three are under construction. The deal covers output from the plants for 20 years.\nSeattle-based Microsoft already operates two data centers in Japan. Microsoft\u2019s compute capacity is slated to expand as the company invests $2.9 billion in the country over the next year.\nSolar has become a favored source of power for tech companies and data center operators in recent years because it is quick and cheap to build. Solar is among the cheapest forms of new generating capacity, and projects are generally completed within 18 months. Plus, users can begin drawing power before the entire project is complete.\nMicrosoft has been a big buyer of solar in recent months. Since the year began, the company has contracted more than 1 gigawatt of solar capacity.\n\ntitle4:\nInstagram introduces new 'Ring' award for top creators\ndescription4:\nInstagram announced on Monday that it\u2019s launching an awards program, with 25 creators set to receive a gold ring next week. The company says the new awards program will recognize creators around the world who shift culture and break barriers.\nThe judges panel for the new awards program includes Instagram head Adam Mosseri, director Spike Lee, designer Marc Jacobs, YouTuber Marques Brownlee, actress Yara Shahidi, makeup artist Pat McGrath, and more.\nWinners will receive a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile. They\u2019ll also be able to design a custom \u201cLike\u201d button that appears when liking feed posts. Notably, winners won\u2019t be receiving any sort of monetary prize.\nImage Credits:Instagram\nThe move comes as Meta has been scaling back its creator payout programs over the past few years. Earlier this year, Meta shut down a program that paid creators for ads placed in their profiles. In 2023, the company stopped offering bonuses to Reels creators on Instagram and Facebook. The company also shut down its affiliate marketing bonuses in 2022.\nThe launch of the new awards program also comes as creators saw a 52% decrease in brand deals in 2024, according to a survey from Kajabi. Additionally, Bank of America said last year that along with a slowdown in sponsored partnerships, there\u2019s competition in the space, as more paid partnerships are concentrated among the top creators.\nGiven these recent shifts, it\u2019s interesting to see Instagram launch a symbolic awards program that doesn\u2019t offer any monetary compensation to recipients. Instead, it\u2019s focused on creating an awards program that\u2019s supposed to be like the Oscars for content creators (without an actual ceremony).\nThe company said in the blog post that the award is \u201call about celebrating those who aren\u2019t afraid to take creative chances and do it their way. Those who bring people together over their creativity, and deserve recognition.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.
