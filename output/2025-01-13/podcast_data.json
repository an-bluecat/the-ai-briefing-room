Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today. We'll see you back here tomorrow.\n        Prompt: Give a quick tech news update script in the style of CNBC techcheck briefing using the following news titles and content. Closely follow how CNBC techcheck chooses context to put into the script, the langauge style and sentence structure. Use the same beginning and ending(including mentioning host Wall-E and Tuesday January 14), and replace CNBC techcheck briefing to 'AI briefing' \n \"title0:\nChina is reportedly open to Elon Musk acquiring TikTok US\ndescription0:\nIn Brief\nChinese government officials have reportedly discussed a scenario where ByteDance sells TikTok\u2019s United States arm to Elon Musk, should the Supreme Court uphold the law banning the app on January 19.\nBloomberg reports that China would strongly prefer for TikTok to stay under ByteDance\u2019s ownership, but says government officials have considered a sale to Musk as part of a broader plan to work with incoming president Donald Trump\u2019s administration. In that scenario, Musk\u2019s X would acquire TikTok US, effectively absorbing the vertical video platform\u2019s 170 million American users and billions in potential ad revenue.\nA TikTok spokesperson called the report \u201cpure fiction\u201d in a statement to Variety.\nThe report states it is unclear how much ByteDance and TikTok know about China\u2019s discussions of a Musk sale, potentially highlighting China\u2019s alleged influence over the platform which brought about this law in the first place.\n\ntitle1:\nMicrosoft forms new internal dev-focused AI org\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft has created a new engineering organization aimed at accelerating AI infrastructure and software development within the company.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Jay Parikh, previously VP and global head of engineering at Meta, will lead the new division. He\u2019ll report to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and oversee groups, including the company\u2019s AI platform and developer teams.\nParikh worked on technical infrastructure and data center projects at Meta. Before joining Microsoft in October, he was appointed the CEO of cloud security startup Lacework.\nThe new org, called CoreAI \u2014 Platform and Tools, is actually a combination of Microsoft\u2019s existing Dev Div and AI platform teams, The Verge reports, along with some employees in the Office of the CTO division. CoreAI effectively rejiggers Microsoft\u2019s developer teams to ensure AI remains a top priority.\nIn an internal memo published on Microsoft\u2019s blog, Nadella said that Microsoft\u2019s focus for the coming year will be \u201cmodel-forward\u201d applications that \u201creshape all application categories.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nRobinhood agrees to pay $45M in SEC settlement\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nRobinhood has agreed to fork out $45 million to settle an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over several alleged violations, reported the Wall Street Journal on Monday.\nThe settlement is being made via two of Robinhood\u2019s brokerage units. One of the violations relates to Robinhood\u2019s November 2021 confirmation that it was hacked \u201cwith more than five million customer email addresses and two million customer names taken, as well as a much smaller set of more specific customer data.\u201d\nThe SEC alleged that the two units covered by the settlement \u2014 Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial \u2014 did not \u201cadopt sufficient policies and procedures to protect customer information,\u201d reported the WSJ.\nThe Robinhood units also did not put a program in place to sufficiently protect customers against identity theft, the SEC also charged.\n\ntitle3:\nXiaohongshu, China's answer to Instagram, hits No. 1 on the App Store as TikTok faces US shutdown\ndescription3:\nOn the heels of TikTok\u2019s looming shut down on January 19 over its ownership in the U.S. (unless the Supreme Court intervenes), it looks like another Chinese app is catching some attention. American users are flocking to Chinese short-form video app Xiaohongshu (known as RedNote in English). The app today surged to the No. 1 spot for free apps on the U.S. App Store. It is also the top Social Networking app across all free iPhone apps.\nSeveral TikTok creators are promoting Xiaohongshu on their accounts, encouraging their followers to transition to the platform. Influencers may not have a crystal ball to predict whether TikTok will weather a ban, but Xiaohongshu gives them a way to hedge their social bets.\n(We\u2019re digging into install numbers and will update this post with more data as we get it.)\nWhy Xiaohongshu?\nXiaohongshu originally launched back in 2013, and it hits a lot of the right notes for creators looking for a TikTok alternative: it has a layout that\u2019s similar to Pinterest\u2019s; it is typically thought of as China\u2019s answer to Instagram; and critically it boasts a number of social shopping features.\nAnd it also has been on a strong, viral trajectory. After a few steady years of growth, during the COVID-19 pandemic Xiaohongshu boomed among younger Chinese consumers. It now boasts 300 million monthly active users; 79% of them women. And for now it\u2019s the top app in the U.S.\nUnsurprisingly, the startup has also caught the attention of investors. To date, it has raised some $917 million in venture funding, with backers including Tencent, Alibaba, ZhenFund, DST, HongShan (formerly Sequoia China), and some 13 others. It was reportedly valued at $17 billion following a secondary share sale in 2024.\nAccording to a report from Bloomberg, the app is projected to increase its profits to over $1 billion in 2024 (it hit $1 billion quarterly sales last year, per this FT report), ahead of a possible IPO. This growth not only signifies the app\u2019s potential but also hints at the promising opportunities it could bring to its creators.\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Xiaohongshu will sustain the interest it\u2019s getting right now. And if it does, it\u2019s also still to be seen what that might mean in terms of scrutiny from U.S. authorities, given Xiaohongshu not only hails from China but seemingly has no pretense at all of being operative in the U.S.\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s notable that TikTok users have not been recommending apps from TikTok\u2019s biggest rival in the country, which is going through its own drama. Meta recently announced that its stable of social apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, would ease content moderation policies, discontinuing its third-party fact-checking in the process \u2014 raising concerns about the potential spread of hateful content and misinformation on its platforms.\n\ntitle4:\nNew tool will help fight health insurance denials\ndescription4:\nHealth-care payments company Waystar on Monday announced a new generative artificial intelligence tool that can help hospitals quickly tackle one of their most costly and tedious responsibilities: fighting insurance denials.\nHospitals and health systems spend nearly $20 billion a year trying to overturn denied claims, according to a March report from the group purchasing organization Premier.\n\"We think if we can develop software that makes people's lives better in an otherwise stressful moment of time when they're getting health care, then we're doing something good,\" Waystar CEO Matt Hawkins told CNBC.\nWaystar's new solution, called AltitudeCreate, uses generative AI to automatically draft appeal letters. The company said the feature could help providers drive down costs and spare them the headache of digging through complex contracts and records to put the letters together manually.\nHawkins led Waystar through its initial public offering in June, where it raised around $1 billion. The company handled more than $1.2 trillion in gross claims volume in 2023, touching about 50% of patients in the U.S.\nClaim denials have become a hot-button issue across the nation following the deadly shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December. Americans flooded social media with posts about their frustrations and resentment toward the insurance industry, often sharing stories about their own negative experiences.\"\n\nResponse:",
