The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.\nNvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.\nCompanies including Microsoft , Meta , Google and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in massive quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.\nOf the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.\nNvidia's revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.\nNvidia recently said demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is \"insane\" and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.\nWith a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second-most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI snatches up Microsoft generative AI research lead\ndescription1:\nIn Brief\nMicrosoft has lost an AI expert and OpenAI gained one, after the former\u2019s VP of generative AI research Sebastian Bubeck left for the latter. The Information first reported the move, and Reuters also confirmed the departure with Microsoft.\nWe know Bubeck as one of the main authors of papers describing Microsoft\u2019s Phi models, a series of extra-small language and vision models intended to help push AI applications to edge devices. That kind of expertise is increasingly important as large, centralized models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o give way in some markets to on-device models that work quickly, privately, and offline.\nWhile Bubeck\u2019s new role at OpenAI is still a mystery, it seems likely he\u2019ll be working on the efficiency and small-model side of things \u2014 a corner of the AI world where OpenAI is currently less prominent.\n\ntitle2:\nAdobe Max 2024: All the major announcements around design and AI\ndescription2:\nAdobe usually makes plenty of big product launches and updates at its annual MAX event, and this year\u2019s design conference is no exception. The creative software giant has announced its first generative AI video model, which is already available in Premiere Pro \u2014 beating rival offerings like OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Google\u2019s Veo to the market.\nCreative Cloud apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign are getting some new features, and the Frame.io cloud collaboration platform has been overhauled with its biggest update since it was launched in 2015, according to Adobe.\n\ntitle3:\nGoogle signed a deal to power data centers with nuclear micro-reactors from Kairos - but the 2030 timeline is very optimistic\ndescription3:\nGoogle announced today that it has signed a deal with nuclear startup Kairos Power to build seven small reactors to supply electricity to its data centers. The agreement promises to add around 500 megawatts of carbon-free electricity at a time when energy demand for data centers and AI is surging.\nThe new power plants are scheduled to come online by the end of the decade, according to Google. It\u2019s not clear whether the reactors would hook up to Google\u2019s sites directly \u2014 an arrangement known as \u201cbehind the meter\u201d \u2014 or if they would feed into the grid with Google claiming the carbon-free power by way of its agreement with Kairos.\nWith the deal, Google joins Microsoft and Amazon in turning to nuclear power to satiate its thirst for electricity. In September, Microsoft announced that it would pay Constellation Energy to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island that was shuttered in 2019. Earlier this year, Amazon said it would build a hyperscale data center and directly connect it to another nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.\nIf Kairos can hit the 2030 deadline, it would be a slight revision to a recent forecast: as recently as July, the company was targeting commercial operations by \u201cthe early 2030s,\u201d according to an article published by the U.S. Department of Energy. Even if Kairos can hit the revised target, it\u2019s locked in a race with fusion startups, many of which are aiming to turn on commercial-scale power plants before 2035.\nKairos is one of a new breed of nuclear startups that are building so-called small-modular reactors (SMR) in an attempt to lower the cost and speed the construction of nuclear power plants.\nMost nuclear plants are massive installations, supplying 1,000 megawatts or more but taking years to plan and nearly a decade to build. The newest fission reactors in the U.S., Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Georgia, were commissioned in 2023 and 2024, respectively, snapping a seven year drought (the next newest reactor was commissioned in 2016). Still, they were seven years late and $17 billion over budget.\nSMR startups are attempting to build nuclear power plants faster and cheaper by using mass production techniques to bring down costs and speed construction. Kairos tries to advance the technology a step further by cooling the reactor not with water but molten salts of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved the startup\u2019s plans for a 35-megawatt demonstration reactor, something that has eluded Oklo, another SMR startup.\nDespite the regulatory nod, Kairos still faces significant challenges. No commercial small-modular reactors have been commissioned yet, which means the economics remain largely unproven. On top of that, Kairos\u2019s molten salt design bucks decades of industry experience with water-cooled reactors.\nBut Kairos\u2019s biggest challenge might not be technical at all. While 56% of Americans say they favor nuclear power, according to both Pew Research, 44% remain opposed. The number opposed might rise when reactor sites are picked; the Pew survey only asked people if the U.S. should use expand nuclear power generally, not in their backyards. What\u2019s more, while support for nuclear power is near a recent high, far more people support wind and solar, two technologies that are available today and cost far less than new nuclear power plants.\n\ntitle4:\nMeta finally finds success in AR, VR three years after changing name\ndescription4:\nIn this article EL-FR\nMETA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg presents Orion AR Glasses, as he makes a keynote speech during the Meta Connect annual event, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S. September 25, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo | Reuters\nWhen Facebook changed its name to Meta in October 2021, CEO Mark Zuckerberg used the occasion to show the world his vision of a digital future of work and recreation accessible through a virtual reality headset. The company soon opened its play universe called Horizon Worlds, featuring floating personalized avatars. As the rebranding to Meta approaches its third anniversary, none of that stuff has gone mainstream. But the company appears to have found its footing in virtual and augmented reality through a different medium. After achieving surprise early success in the smart glasses market through a partnership with Ray-Ban, Meta is ginning up excitement for the prototype of a much more advanced pair of glasses called Orion, a project nearly a decade in the making. Zuckerberg's reveal of Orion late last month has triggered a level of enthusiasm that's unfamiliar in the metaverse. The triumphant demo, at Meta's annual Connect event, was a relief to many employees and represented an internal shift in sentiment toward Zuckerberg's costly hardware ambitions, according to people close to the company who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press on the matter. At the start of the demo, Zuckerberg pulled the device out of a locked metal briefcase. He showed off the gadget \u2014 a pair of black, thick-framed AR glasses \u2014 to the live audience before placing it on his face. Orion comes with a wireless puck that allows it to run holographic virtual images on top of what users see in real life. It also relies on a wristband that picks up on a user's neural signals to let them control the device. The demo was seamless. The crowd oohed and aahed. Rave product reviews followed from the few who got to test it. CNBC's Julia Boorstin described a call she had with her producer, saying, \"It was like I was FaceTiming with him but he was in my glasses.\" The Verge's Alex Heath played Zuckerberg in a game of Pong and wrote that he \"noticed little to no lag in the game.\" \"The right way to look at Orion is as a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said at Connect. \"These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\nwatch now\nFollowing the Orion showcase, Meta is preparing to strengthen its relationship with software developers as it works toward building a consumer version of the device, and to pushing its current generation of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to more consumers for the 2024 holiday shopping season. The company is also looking at ways to bring the technology developed for the Orion wristband to its other consumer devices, notably the Quest VR headsets and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to a person familiar with the matter. For Meta, the uptick in excitement among employees and users comes well after Wall Street jumped back into the stock. After the company lost almost two-thirds of its value in 2022 and then slashed about a quarter of its workforce, or 21,000 jobs, Meta's stock price almost tripled last year and is up more than 60% in 2024, reaching a fresh high this month. Meta proved the resilience of its dominant online advertising business, rebuilding the underlying technology after Apple's iOS privacy change made it harder to target users, and adding generative artificial intelligence tools to make it easier for brands to run campaigns. But proving that it can mimic its digital ad success in a totally different market has been a persistent challenge. Facebook's initial foray into VR came in 2014 with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus. Since then, the company has poured more than $63 billion into what's now called Reality Labs, its AR and VR hardware and software division, and it's recording operating losses in the billions of dollars per quarter. In the second quarter, Reality Labs generated just $353 million in revenue, accounting for less than 1% of the company's total sales. Industrywide, global shipments of VR and AR headsets in the period sank roughly 28% from a year earlier to 1.1 million units, according to market researcher IDC. \"This is a very long-term bet,\" Zuckerberg said in July 2023. \"At a deep level, I understand the discomfort that a lot of investors have with it because it's just outside of the model of I think even most long-term investors.\" Orion provides a tangible example of the company's strategy and a logical and compelling next step following smart glasses, people familiar with Reality Labs told CNBC. Meta declined to comment.\nA project 10 years in the making\nMeta is planning to start courting developers next year, as it tries to get them excited about building apps for Orion so the company can learn what might resonate with consumers, according to people familiar with the company's road map. The push into the developer community would coincide with Meta's expected debut of the fourth generation of its Llama family of AI models. By releasing a more powerful Llama, Meta is hoping that developers would be able to incorporate the software in their future AR apps to help power tasks like recognizing real-world objects and more accurately reacting to voice commands, the people said. Ultimately, Meta is working toward building a consumer version of Orion, something that could happen within two years, they said. That timeline may be overly ambitious considering how long it took to get Orion this far. Facebook began working on the device as far back as 2016 under the leadership of Oculus' then chief scientist, Michael Abrash, according to people familiar with the matter. Abrash is now chief scientist at Reality Labs.\nMeta employee Sara Nicholson poses with the Ray-Ban sunglasses at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 24, 2024. Manuel Orbegozo | Reuters\nIn 2018, the project was moved out of research and development and was put on the product path under the guidance of Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth, who was Facebook's head of hardware at the time and is now Meta's technology chief. At one point, the company had a version of the device that offered AR visuals but it had to be in extremely controlled settings to work, the people said. For example, visuals didn't work outdoors, they said. Meta has been testing functioning versions of Orion glasses for well over two years, the people said, getting the product to a point where it could finally be unveiled to the broader company and to outsiders. The company finished the prototype in March. Engineers put a lot of work into getting the device to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), about twice the weight of a heavy pair of glasses, and to have a 70-degree field of view, sources said. Zuckerberg, who's been the driving force behind the company's advances in AR and VR, made the ultimate decision to go public with Orion, the people said.\nBuilding on surprise success\nMeta is likely years away from being able to deliver a consumer version of Orion and has numerous challenges to overcome to reach mass production. \"One could criticize Orion as vaporware,\" Joseph Bonner, an analyst at Argus Research, wrote in a report to clients on Oct. 4, referring to \"technology that may not end up in an actual product.\" Bonner, who recommends buying the stock, said the product demonstrates \"Meta's continued commitment to virtual and mixed reality applications.\" Meta will need to develop a global manufacturing supply chain that can account for some of the rare materials used in the device. One particular hurdle will be figuring out how to get mass quantities of silicon carbide, which is used for the displays in the Orion lenses. Meta recently hired someone from semiconductor contract manufacturing company GlobalFoundries to help develop and oversee the supply chain for Orion and related AR and VR devices, people with knowledge of the matter said. In the meantime, Meta is looking to build on the success of its second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Released in partnership with EssilorLuxottica in September of last year, the product featured a number of upgrades, including better camera quality, improved battery life and an AI voice assistant. The smart glasses went viral on TikTok during the holiday shopping season, and sales exceeded both companies' expectations. More than 730,000 units have been sold in their first three quarters since release, according to IDC. Zuckerberg told investors in July that they were \"a bigger hit sooner than expected.\" Last month, Meta and Luxottica agreed to extend their partnership, with plans to release a bulkier, third generation of their glasses in time for the coming holiday season. The new device is expected to include a small display in one of the lenses, people familiar with the matter said. A Luxottica representative didn't respond to a request for comment. Meta is also opening a pop-up shop to showcase the smart glasses and to get them in front of more consumers. The pop-up shop will be at a retail space in Los Angeles. A job post by BDS Connected Solutions says the company is looking for retail staffers in the West Hollywood neighborhood. \"We're staffing up for the ultimate Meta pop-up experience in the heart of Los Angeles,\" BDS says in a post on X. \"With lowriders, street vibes, and everything that makes LA iconic, this pop-up is a true celebration of Southern California culture.\"\"\n\nResponse:",
