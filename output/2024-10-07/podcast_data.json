The company also can\u2019t force developers to use Google Play\u2019s billing system and must allow them to notify users of other ways to pay.\nGoogle also must also permit third-party Android app stores to access the Google Play Store\u2019s catalog of apps and must carry third-party apps in its app store.\nIn response to the ruling, Google said it will file an appeal and ask the courts to pause the ordered changes, arguing that the changes would \u201cundercut Android\u2019s ability to compete with Apple\u2019s iOS.\u201d\n\ntitle1:\nRobotaxis are here and the public is divided\ndescription1:\nDriverless cars are speeding onto America's streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question.\nNearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That's because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM -owned Cruise.\nNow Tesla , the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.\nThe company's existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won't guarantee a safe robotaxi network.\nTesla's upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course.\nAlphabet -owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.\nBesides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.\nAmazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn't been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi.\nAs driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else's car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it's unclear how long those partnerships will last.\nWatch this video to learn more.\n\ntitle2:\nBanks and tech companies at odds over online fraud liability in UK\ndescription2:\nMeta is facing calls from U.K. banks and payment firms like Revolut to financially compensate people who fall for scams on their services. Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto via Getty Images\nTensions are escalating between banking and payment companies and social media firms in the U.K. over who should be liable for compensating people if they fall victim to fraud schemes online. Starting from Oct. 7, banks will be required to start compensating victims of so-called authorized push payment (APP) fraud a maximum \u00a385,000 if those individuals affected were tricked or psychologically manipulated into handing over the cash. APP fraud is a form of a scam where criminals attempt to convince people to send them money by impersonating individuals or businesses selling a service. The \u00a385,000 reimbursement sum could prove costly for large banks and payment firms. However, it's actually lower than the mandatory \u00a3415,000 reimbursement amount that the U.K.'s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) had previously proposed. The PSR backed down from its bid for the lofty maximum compensation payout following industry backlash, with industry group the Payments Association in particular saying it would be far too costly a sum tor the financial services sector to bear. But now that the mandatory fraud compensation is being rolled out in the U.K., questions are being asked about whether financial firms are facing the brunt of the cost for helping fraud victims. On Thursday, London-based digital bank Revolut accused Meta of falling \"woefully short of what's required to tackle fraud globally.\" The Facebook-owner announced a partnership earlier this week with U.K. lenders NatWest and Metro Bank, to share intelligence on fraud activity that takes place on its platforms.\nWoody Malouf, Revolut's head of financial crime, said that Meta and other social media platforms should help cover the cost of reimbursing victims of fraud and that, by sharing no responsibility in doing so, \"they have no incentive to do anything about it.\" Revolut's call for large tech platforms to financially compensate people who fall for scams on their websites and apps isn't new.\nSocial media the 'Wild West' of fraud\nTensions have been running high between banks and tech companies for some time. Online fraud has risen dramatically over the last several years due to an acceleration in the usage of digital platforms to pay others and buy products online. In June, the Financial Times reported that the Labour Party had drafted proposals to force technology firms to reimburse victims of fraud that originates on their platforms. It is not clear whether the government still plans to require tech firms to pay compensation out to victims of APP fraud. A government spokesperson was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Riccardo Tordera, director of policy and government relations at industry body the Payments Association, told CNBC that, given the \"disproportionate amount\" of fraud that happens on social media, it's \"unacceptable\" tech firms don't take a mandated responsibility for reimbursing fraud victims. \"Social media platforms are still the wild west for fraudulent behaviour, and our members call for those in charge to increase the urgency with which they are embracing regulation that would make this activity more difficult to carry out,\" Tordera said in emailed comments Monday. Matt Akroyd, a commercial litigation lawyer at Stewarts, told CNBC that, after their victory on lowering the maximum reimbursement limit for APP fraud down to \u00a385,000, banks \"will receive another boost if their efforts to push the government to place some regulatory liability on tech companies is also successful.\" However, he added: \"The question of what regulatory regime could cover those companies who do not play an active role in the PSR's payment systems, and how, is complicated meaning that this issue is not likely to be resolved any time soon.\" More broadly, banks and regulators have long been pushing social media companies for more collaboration with retail banks in the U.K. to help combat the fast-growing and constantly evolving fraud threat. A key ask has been for the tech firms to share more detailed intelligence on how criminals are abusing their platforms.\nwatch now\nAt a U.K. finance industry event focusing on economic fraud in March 2023, regulators and law enforcement stressed the need for social media companies to do more. \"We hear anecdotally today from all of the firms that we talk to, that a large proportion of this fraud originates from social media platforms,\" Kate Fitzgerald, head of policy at the PSR, told attendees of the event. She added that \"absolute transparency\" was needed on where the fraud was occurring so that regulators could know where to focus their efforts in the value chain. Social media firms not doing enough to combat and remove attempts to defraud internet users was another complaint from regulatory authorities at the event.\n\"The bit that's missing is the at-scale social media companies taking down suspect accounts that are involved in fraud,\" Rob Jones, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, a unit of the U.K. National Crime Agency, said at the event. Jones added that it was tough to \"break the inertia\" at tech companies to \"really get them to get after it.\"\nTech firms push 'cross-industry collaboration'\nMeta has pushed back on suggestions that it should be held liable for paying out compensation to victims of APP fraud. In written evidence to a parliamentary committee last year, the social media giant said that banks in the U.K. are \"too focused on their efforts to transfer liability for fraud to other industries,\" adding that this \"creates a hostile environment which plays into the hands of fraudsters.\" The company said that it can use live intelligence from big banks through its Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange (FIRE) initiative to help stop fraud and evolve and improve its machine learning and AI detection systems. Meta called on the government to \"encourage more cross-industry collaboration like this.\" In a statement to CNBC Thursday, the tech giant stressed that banks, including Revolut, should look to join forces with Meta on its FIRE framework to facilitate data exchanges between the firm and large lenders. FIRE \"is designed to enable banks to share information so we can work together to protect people using our respective services,\" a spokesperson for Meta said last week. \"Fraud is a multi-sector spanning issue that can only be addressed by working collaboratively.\"\n\ntitle3:\nData breach leaks SSNs of over 230,000 Comcast customers\ndescription3:\nA data breach has exposed the names, addresses, social security numbers, and birthdates of more than 237,700 Comcast customers. The breach stems from a security incident at Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS), a debt collection agency Comcast previously used, according to a filing with the state of Maine on Friday, as reported by BleepingComputer and TechCrunch.\nFBCS revealed that it had suffered a breach in February, exposing the sensitive information of more than 4.2 million people. FBCS informed Comcast in July that its customer data had been affected, saying an \u201cunauthorized party downloaded data from FBCS systems and encrypted some systems as part of a ransomware attack.\u201d\nBreach Information:\nTotal number of persons affected (including residents): 237,703 Total number of Maine residents affected: 22 Date(s) Breach Occurred: February 14, 2024 Date Breach Discovered: July 17, 2024 Description of the Breach: External system breach (hacking)\nComcast says the data included in the breach \u201cdates from around 2021\u201d and that it stopped using FBCS\u2019s services in 2020. Truist Bank also revealed that some of its customers were impacted by the FBCS breach. Comcast is providing identity theft protection and credit monitoring services to customers affected by the leak.\n\ntitle4:\nFTX bankruptcy judge approves more than $14 billion payback plan\ndescription4:\nAlmost all of the creditors of failed crypto company FTX will end up profiting from the money they put into the exchange, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled Monday.\nNearly two years after FTX spiraled into bankruptcy, a Delaware judge approved the company's reorganization plan, which involves paying out more than $14 billion to customers of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange.\n\"Looking ahead, we are poised to return 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors through what will be the largest and most complex bankruptcy estate asset distribution in history,\" said John Ray, who took over as FTX CEO following the company's bankruptcy filing in late 2022, in a statement on Monday.\nRay, who also shepherded Enron through bankruptcy, added that the estate is working to finalize arrangements to make distributions to creditors around the world.\nThe company says it has collected between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion worth of property for distribution. FTX previously estimated that it owes creditors around $11.2 billion.\nAccording to the plan approved by Delaware bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey, 98% of FTX's creditors will get 119% of the amount of their allowed claim as of November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy protection.\nThe price of bitcoin is up roughly 260% since FTX's failure. FTX raised the money by selling a number of assets, including venture investments held by the exchange and other investments held by Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried's crypto hedge fund.\nOne of FTX's most high-profile investments was in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, which is backed by Amazon. FTX sold most of its stake in Anthropic this year for nearly $900 million.\nThe bankruptcy estate says it will make a separate announcement about the date the payout plan will go into effect and when it anticipates the start of distributions.\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted of seven criminal counts last November, including charges related to stealing billions of dollars from FTX's customers. He received a 25-year prison sentence.\n\u2014 CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Caroline Ellison sentenced to two years in prison for role in FTX collapse\"\n\nResponse:",
