On Thursday, the company introduced Jules Tools, a command-line interface that brings Jules directly into the developer\u2019s terminal. The CLI lets developers interact with the agent using commands, streamlining workflows by eliminating the need to switch between the web interface and GitHub. It allows them to stay within their environment while delegating coding tasks and validating results.\n\u201cWe want to reduce context switching for developers as much as possible,\u201d said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in an interview.\nGoogle already offers Gemini CLI, an AI-based command-line tool that works across developer environments like terminals and CI/CD pipelines. Both Gemini CLI and Jules use Google\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro AI model under the hood. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that Jules Tools is designed for \u201cvery scoped tasks,\u201d while Gemini CLI requires users to be \u201ca lot more iterative\u201d and to \u201ccollaborate a lot more with the tool.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s Jules Tools Image Credits:Google\nGoogle\u2019s senior developer advocate Denise Kwan also elaborated in a Medium post on how Jules differs from Gemini CLI. Jules is less interactive by design, she noted, and executes tasks independently once the user approves its plan.\nIn addition to the CLI, Google has made Jules\u2019 API public, which it had previously used for internal development. The purpose of this is also to help developers use Jules more often as they can extend the tool into their existing workflows where they have \u201ca lot of muscle memory and familiarity,\u201d Korevec said.\nDevelopers can also use the API to integrate Jules with their integrated development environment (IDE), a software application that helps make coding easier by providing a list of tools, such as VS Code. However, Korevec told TechCrunch that her team is keen to build specific plug-ins for IDEs to further expand Jules\u2019 presence.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nThe latest updates come just after Google introduced \u201cmemory\u201d for Jules to keep a record of interactions with users and their preferences, nudges, and corrections. For the last few weeks, the tool has also added a list of other features, including a stacked layout for the diff viewer, image upload, and the ability to read and respond to comments on pull requests.\nNow, another area Google is exploring with Jules is reducing its reliance on GitHub. Currently, the agent codes within a GitHub repository \u2014 requiring developers to either connect it to an existing repo or provide a blank one to work in.\n\u201cUsers want Jules to integrate with other code hosting providers,\u201d said Korevec. \u201cWe are looking into how we can enable that with other version control systems. We are also looking into enabling it for people who don\u2019t want a version control system, or they don\u2019t care where their code is hosted.\u201d\nOversight of AI tools remains a challenge, especially when they are used in professional settings. Jules, however, is designed to notify the user if it gets stuck on a particular task, prompting them to step in and assist.\n\u201cIf something happens where it runs into an issue, or it runs into a situation where it can\u2019t unstick itself, it will pause and ask me a question,\u201d Korevec said.\nHowever, oversight becomes more difficult when users interact with Jules on mobile, as native notifications are not yet supported. Korevec noted that many users are already accessing Jules through its mobile web interface, and said Google is working to improve the mobile experience \u2014 particularly by exploring ways to offer native notifications.\nSo far, Jules has primarily been used by software engineers and other professionals \u2014 unlike many vibe coding platforms that position themselves as go-to tools for non-coders. Still, some users are experimenting with Jules as a complement to more casual or creative coding environments.\n\u201cWe see a lot of people take that project that they have hit the limit in whatever vibe coding tool they\u2019re using, and then bring that to Jules for further extending it,\u201d Korevec told TechCrunch.\nLaunched in public preview in May, Jules exited beta in August and is now available under structured pricing tiers. A free plan offers up to 15 individual daily tasks and three concurrent tasks. Higher limits are available through the Google AI Pro and Ultra plans, priced at $19.99 and $124.99 per month, offering approximately 5x and 20x the limits, respectively.\n\ntitle1:\nOpenAI's Sora soars to No. 3 on the US App Store\ndescription1:\nOpenAI\u2019s Sora app for AI videos is a viral hit, despite being invite-only for now and limited to users in the U.S. and Canada at launch. On its first day, Sora saw 56,000 downloads, and is now ranked as the No. 3 Top Overall app on the U.S. App Store, according to new data from app intelligence provider Appfigures.\nThe firm estimates Sora\u2019s iOS app pulled in a total of 164,000 installs during its first two days, September 30th and October 1st.\nThe day-one figure puts Sora\u2019s debut ahead of the performance of other major AI app launches, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude and Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and puts it on par with xAI\u2019s Grok launch. Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini iOS apps had somewhat stronger launches, with each reaching at least 80,000 downloads on day one.\nSince Sora is still invite-only, this may not be the fairest comparison, we\u2019ll admit. It\u2019s possible the new video app could have attracted even more installs if it were open to all users.\nDespite this restriction, it\u2019s a fairly strong showing for the new release, indicating demand for AI video tools in consumers\u2019 hands in more of a social networking-like experience. (This is much to the chagrin of some at OpenAI, who want the company to focus on solving harder problems that benefit humanity. But who\u2019s to say that humanity isn\u2019t benefiting from deepfakes of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman asking, \u201cAre my piggies enjoying their slop?\u201d)\nTo compare Sora\u2019s early success to other AI apps, Appfigures had to run an analysis that only looked at the other AI apps\u2019 U.S. and Canadian downloads. That\u2019s because the different AI apps on the market have pursued different launch strategies. For instance, ChatGPT initially launched on iOS and limited itself to U.S. users at the time, while Grok limited its iOS-only release to the U.S., Australia, and India. Anthropic, meanwhile, didn\u2019t indicate there were geographic restrictions when it first brought its Claude app to iOS last year.\nFor more of an apples-to-apples comparison, Appfigures crunched the numbers to focus only on each app\u2019s U.S. downloads, plus those in Canada, if the app had been available there at launch.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nIt found that ChatGPT and Gemini had larger launches than Sora, with 81,000 and 80,000 day-one iOS downloads, respectively. Sora tied with Grok for day-one installs, at 56,000. And it easily beat out the launches from AI apps Claude and Copilot. The former pulled in 21,000 day-one downloads, while the latter only saw 7,000.\nSora also hit the U.S. App Store\u2019s top charts, becoming the No. 3 overall top app by day two. For comparison, ChatGPT reached No. 1 on its second day, while Grok was No. 4, Gemini was No. 6, Copilot was No. 19, and Claude was No. 78.\n\ntitle2:\nApple shelves Vision Pro overhaul to focus on AI glasses\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nApple is sidelining plans to overhaul its Vision Pro VR glasses to focus on developing AI smart glasses that can compete with products from Meta, according to a new report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman.\nAlthough the company had been developing a cheaper and lighter version of its Vision Pro, Apple is moving staff from that project to work on smart glasses.\nBloomberg reports that the tech giant is developing at least two types of smart glasses. The first model, nicknamed N50, will pair with an iPhone and not have its own display. Apple reportedly plans to unveil these smart glasses as soon as next year and release them in 2027.\nThe second version of smart glasses that the company is working on include a display. These glasses would compete with the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which were unveiled last month. While Apple had planned to release this version of its smart glasses in 2028, the company is now working to expedite development.\nDespite its recent shift in focus, Apple lags behind Meta, which launched its first smart glasses in 2021.\n\ntitle3:\nAmazon to resume drone delivery following crash in Arizona\ndescription3:\nAmazon will restart its drone delivery service in Arizona beginning Friday as two federal agencies continue to investigate a crash that occurred earlier this week.\nAmazon suspended operations in the West Valley of the Phoenix Metro area \u2014 currently its only commercial market \u2014 following a crash Wednesday. Two of the company\u2019s Prime Air delivery drones collided with the boom of a crane near its same-day site in Tolleson, Arizona, which sent them crashing to the ground.\nAmazon has been delivering packages, weighing up to five pounds, to customers via its Prime Air drone service in the West Valley of Phoenix since November 2024.\nAmazon spokesperson Terrence Clark said the company will continue to support \u201congoing reviews by relevant agencies.\u201d The National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday that investigations into the crash are underway.\n\u201cSafety is our top priority, and we\u2019ve completed our own internal review of this incident and are confident that there wasn\u2019t an issue with the drones or the technology that supports them,\u201d Clark said in an emailed statement. \u201cNonetheless, we\u2019ve introduced additional processes like enhanced visual landscape inspections to better monitor for moving obstructions such as cranes.\u201d\nThe program has faced several setbacks over the years, including the departure of key executives, as the company pushes toward its goal of using drones to deliver 500 million packages per year by the end of the decade.\nAmazon halted testing of its drones after a mid-air collision involving two of its models in Oregon in December 2024. At the time, Amazon said it would suspend drone deliveries in College Station, Texas and Arizona pending a software update to its drone fleet. Amazon no longer has operations in College Station.\nTechcrunch event Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025 Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Hugging Face, Elad Gil, Vinod Khosla \u2014 just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\nAmazon has also scored a win or two, including receiving approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to fly its delivery drones longer distances. That approval in May 2024 removed one regulatory hurdle, allowing Amazon to expand its Prime Air service. Amazon has previously said it planned to expand Prime Air delivery services in Texas in Richardson, San Antonio, and Waco, and across the country with sites planned for Detroit and Kansas City.\n\ntitle4:\nAnthropic hires new CTO with focus on AI infrastructure\ndescription4:\nAnthropic has a new chief technical officer, former Stripe CTO Rahul Patil. Patil started at the company earlier this week, taking over from co-founder Sam McCandlish, who will move to a new role as chief architect.\nAs part of the change, Anthropic is updating the structure of its core technical group, bringing the company\u2019s product-engineering team into closer contact with the infrastructure and inference teams. As CTO, Patil will oversee compute, infrastructure, inference, and a variety of other engineering tasks. In the chief architect role, McCandlish will work on pre-training and large-scale model training, extending much of his previous work. Both Patil and McCandlish will report to Anthropic president Daniela Amodei.\nThis new leadership structure comes as Anthropic faces intense infrastructure competition from AI labs at OpenAI and Meta, which have invested billions into computing infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Meta plans to spend $600 billion on U.S. infrastructure through the end of 2028, and OpenAI has contracted a similar amount through its work with Oracle and the Stargate project. The scale of Anthropic\u2019s own infrastructure spending is less clear, but there will be immense pressure to optimize the growing infrastructure for both speed and power consumption.\nAt the same time, the popularity of Anthropic\u2019s Claude products has already put the company\u2019s infrastructure under significant strain. In July, the company introduced new rate limits to Claude Code, with an eye toward power users who had been running the app \u201ccontinuously in the background, 24/7.\u201d Under the new rules, users are limited to between 240 and 480 hours of Sonnet usage each week, and between 24 and 40 hours of Opus 4 usage, depending on infrastructure strain.\nWith more than 20 years in different engineering roles, Patil brings significant infrastructure experience to Anthropic. He previously spent five years in technical roles at Stripe and served as a senior VP for cloud infrastructure at Oracle. He has also held engineering roles at Amazon and Microsoft.\nIn a statement, Amodei emphasized Patil\u2019s experience building stable infrastructure for enterprises. \u201cRahul brings a proven track record in building and scaling the kind of dependable infrastructure that businesses need,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited about what this means for strengthening Claude\u2019s position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises.\u201d\nIn a paired statement, Patil applauded Anthropic\u2019s research and commitment to AI safety. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to join Anthropic at this pivotal moment in AI development,\u201d Patil said, adding that his work at the company \u201cfeels like the most important work I could be doing right now \u2014 I personally can\u2019t think of a greater calling and responsibility.\u201d\"\n\nResponse:",
