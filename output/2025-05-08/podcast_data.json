Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

Eligible API customers and new ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu subscribers can choose to have their data stored at rest in supported countries: Japan, India, Singapore, and South Korea.\n\u201cFor the API platform and ChatGPT business products, data remains confidential, secure, and entirely owned by you,\u201d wrote OpenAI in a blog post. \u201cData residency further enhances data control for organizations.\u201d\nThe debut of the Asia data residency program comes as OpenAI looks to accelerate its expansion abroad. This week, the company announced OpenAI for Countries, an initiative OpenAI says will enable it to build out the infrastructure needed to better serve international clientele.\n\ntitle1:\nChatGPT's deep research tool gets a GitHub connector to answer questions about code\ndescription1:\nOpenAI is enhancing its AI-powered \u201cdeep research\u201d feature with the ability to analyze codebases on GitHub.\nOn Thursday, OpenAI announced what it\u2019s calling the first \u201cconnector\u201d for ChatGPT deep research, the company\u2019s tool that searches across the web and other sources to compile thorough research reports on a topic. Now, ChatGPT deep research can link to GitHub (in beta), allowing developers to ask questions about a codebase and engineering documents.\nThe connector will be available for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users over the next few days, with Enterprise and Edu support coming soon, according to an OpenAI spokesperson.\nOpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Deep Research feature can now connect to GitHub Image Credits:OpenAI\nThe GitHub connector for ChatGPT deep research arrives as AI companies look to make their AI-powered chatbots more useful by building ways to link them to outside platforms and services. Anthropic, for example, recently debuted Integrations, which gives apps a pipeline into its AI chatbot Claude.\nOpenAI years ago offered a plug-in capability for ChatGPT, but deprecated it in favor of custom chatbots called GPTs.\n\u201cI often hear that users find ChatGPT\u2019s deep research agent so valuable that they want it to connect to their internal sources, in addition to the web,\u201d OpenAI Head of Business Products Nate Gonzalez wrote in a blog post on LinkedIn. \u201c[That\u2019s why] today we\u2019re introducing our first connector.\u201d\nIn addition to answering questions about codebases, the new ChatGPT deep research GitHub connector lets ChatGPT users break down product specs into technical tasks and dependencies, summarize code structure and patterns, and understand how to implement new APIs using real code examples.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nThere\u2019s a risk that ChatGPT deep research hallucinates, of course \u2014 no AI model in existence doesn\u2019t confidently make things up sometimes. But OpenAI is pitching the new capability as a potential time saver, not a replacement for experts.\nAn OpenAI spokesperson said ChatGPT will respect an organization\u2019s settings so users only see GitHub content they\u2019re already allowed to view and codebases that\u2019ve been explicitly shared with ChatGPT.\nOpenAI has been investing in its tooling for assistive coding, recently unveiling an open source coding tool for terminals called Codex CLI and upgrading the ChatGPT desktop app to read code in a handful of developer-focused coding apps. The company sees programming as a top use case for its models. Case in point, OpenAI has reportedly reached an agreement to buy AI-powered coding assistant Windsurf for $3 billion.\nIn other OpenAI news on Thursday, the company launched fine-tuning options for developers looking to customize its newer models for particular applications. Devs can now fine-tune OpenAI\u2019s o4-mini \u201creasoning\u201d model via a technique OpenAI calls reinforcement fine-tuning, which uses task-specific grading to improve the model\u2019s performance. Fine-tuning has also rolled out for the company\u2019s GPT-4.1 nano model.\nOnly verified organizations can fine-tune o4-mini, according to OpenAI. GPT-4.1 nano fine-tuning, meanwhile, is available for all paying developers.\nOpenAI began gating certain models and developer features behind verification, which requires organizations to submit an ID and other identity documents, in April. The company claims that it\u2019s necessary to prevent abuse.\n\ntitle2:\nMeta taps former Google DeepMind director to lead its AI research lab\ndescription2:\nIn Brief\nMeta has chosen Robert Fergus to lead its Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab, according to Bloomberg.\nFergus had been working at Google DeepMind as a research director for roughly five years, per his LinkedIn. Prior to Google, he worked as a researcher scientist at Meta.\nMeta\u2019s FAIR, which has been around since 2013, has faced challenges in recent years, according to a report from Fortune. FAIR led research on the company\u2019s early AI models, including Llama 1 and Llama 2. However, researchers have reportedly departed the unit en masse for other startups, companies, and even Meta\u2019s newer GenAI group, which led the development of Llama 4.\nMeta\u2019s previous VP of AI Research, Joelle Pineau, announced in April she\u2019d be leaving the company for a new opportunity.\n\ntitle3:\nAurora to add night driving, new routes as it ramps driverless trucking\ndescription3:\nAutonomous vehicle technology company Aurora Innovation plans to expand on the success of its first driverless commercial launch and add night driving to its operations.\nAurora said Thursday that in the second half of 2025, it will start sending its self-driving trucks out at night and during adverse weather conditions like rain or heavy wind. The company, which provided the update in its first-quarter shareholder letter, also plans to expand its driverless trucking route beyond Dallas to Houston, and into El Paso and Phoenix.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to have a high return on asset for every truck that we have, and so we\u2019ll try to drive efficiency to get as many miles on as many trucks as fast as possible,\u201d Aurora CFO Dave Maday said Thursday during the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call. \u201cWe should be able to double our drive time as soon as we unlock night. And that\u2019s our next key milestone.\u201d\nAurora already runs freight with self-driving trucks in those conditions, but with a human safety operator behind the wheel. The company said it has completed more than 4,000 miles in a single self-driving truck without a driver running freight for its launch customers Hirschbach Motor Lines and Uber Freight.\nIn the week since Aurora\u2019s commercial launch, the company has already expanded to two driverless trucks operating on a daily basis and says it expects to operate \u201ctens of trucks\u201d by the end of 2025.\nThe milestone and future plans come alongside another major shift at the company: the resignation of co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson.\nAurora shared new details Thursday in its first-quarter shareholder letter about plans to grow its autonomous freight service, signaling it will offer more specific timelines for key milestones as it expands.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nAurora realized $871,000 in pilot revenue from its drivered commercial freight runs, which was up 22% on a quarterly basis and 54% compared to the same time last year, per Maday.\n\u201cAt commercial launch, we will begin recognizing revenue,\u201d he said Thursday during Aurora\u2019s first-quarter earnings call. \u201cThis will include driverless revenue, as well as continued pilot revenue \u2026 With our deliberate approach to launch, we expect our 2025 revenue to be modest, in the mid-single-digit millions. For modeling purposes, we expect revenue to build sequentially throughout the year.\u201d\nThe company reported $211 million in operating expenses, including $153 million for R&D. It used $142 million in operating cash and $8 million in capex in the first quarter, ending with nearly $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Aurora expects to spend $175 million to $185 million per quarter for the rest of this year.\nIn the short-term, Aurora plans to own, operate, maintain, and insure its own trucks \u2014 made available on the Uber Freight network \u2014 for customers. The company is working with partners Paccar and Volvo Trucks to build self-driving trucks at scale. Starting in 2027 or earlier, Aurora expects customers to buy those trucks directly from manufacturers so it can shift to a driver-as-a-service model and achieve \u201chigh gross margins,\u201d per Maday.\nThis article was updated with more information about Aurora\u2019s recorded revenue and the company\u2019s next milestones.\n\ntitle4:\nAppfigures: Apple made over $10B from US App Store commissions last year\ndescription4:\nOver $10 billion \u2014 that\u2019s how much revenue Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store raked in last year, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures.\nThe firm\u2019s estimates indicate that U.S. App Store revenue from commissions more than doubled between 2020 and 2024. In 2020, Apple\u2019s share of App Store commissions was approximately $4.76 billion, growing to over $10.1 billion by 2024.\nBased on Appfigures\u2019 data, U.S. App Store developers generated $33.68 billion in gross revenue from their apps and games using Apple\u2019s payments system in 2024, and took home $23.57 billion after Apple\u2019s cut.\nImage Credits:Appfigures\nThough Apple doesn\u2019t typically break out its App Store revenue during earnings, it did publish a report in May 2023 where it said the App Store globally generated $104 billion in estimated billings for digital goods and services in 2022.\nHowever, Appfigures\u2019 analysis found the App Store made $61.5 billion globally in 2022, which grew to $91.3 billion in 2024. From this, Apple made more than $27.39 billion in commissions globally last year, Appfigures also said.\nThat leads to a discrepancy between Appfigures\u2019 analysis and Apple\u2019s own.\nThis can be explained by an important caveat found in Apple\u2019s report. Under Apple\u2019s chart, it states that its \u201cbillings and sales\u201d figures are \u201cnot the same as App Store billings.\u201d That\u2019s important here.\nTechcrunch event Exhibit at TechCrunch Sessions: AI Secure your spot at TC Sessions: AI and show 1,200+ decision-makers what you\u2019ve built \u2014 without the big spend.

Berkeley, CA | BOOK NOW\nWhen Apple wrote its report, the company was trying to show how big the App Store is and how key it is to the overall economy, so it merged App Store revenue with revenue generated outside the App Store to generate its total for the \u201cBillings and Sales\u201d category.\nIn the report, Apple calculated the portion of an app\u2019s total revenue that is facilitated by the App Store, even if the purchase was made elsewhere. For instance, if a user buys a subscription to Hulu on the web, but then spends 60% of their time streaming Hulu on Apple devices, Apple credits itself with facilitating 60% of that user\u2019s spend. (To determine usage, the report relied on third-party sources, like market research firms, to estimate how much usage occurred on smartphones versus tablets, desktops, or TVs.)\nApple also allows enterprises to distribute apps with in-app purchases, but these aren\u2019t visible in the App Store.\n\u201cGrave Irreparable Harm?\u201d\nExamining the numbers around U.S. Apple App Store revenue is more relevant than ever in the wake of the recent court ruling that now prevents Apple from charging a 27% commission on transactions that take place outside the App Store.\nApple initially attempted to comply with the court\u2019s injunction resulting from its antitrust battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games by making changes that wouldn\u2019t harm App Store profits.\nTo do so, Apple last year gave developers a way to apply for an exception to its App Store rules so they could add web links inside their apps that directed customers to external purchases. However, Apple continued to charge a 27% commission on those purchases and dictated how the website links should appear. (This even included the use of \u201cscare screens\u201d to warn consumers of the dangers of making purchases outside the App Store.)\nLast week, a judge ruled that Apple was in \u201cwillful violation\u201d of the 2021 injunction by continuing to collect fees on purchases made outside apps and by creating new anticompetitive barriers.\nThis decision forced Apple to update its U.S. App Store rules, which now allow developers to link out to other ways for consumers to make purchases, without obstacles or commissions. Since then, several apps have taken advantage of the ability to introduce web payments, including Spotify, Amazon Kindle, and Patreon. One small game emulator called Delta is now supporting itself via Patreon memberships, too.\nApple is appealing the decision, arguing in its most recent filing that the ruling causes Apple \u201cgrave irreparable harm.\u201d\n\u201cThese restrictions, which will cost Apple substantial sums annually, are based on conduct that has never been adjudicated to be (and is not) unlawful,\u201d Apple\u2019s filing stated. \u201cRather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law injunction that is itself invalid.\u201d\nThis argument won\u2019t likely go over well with developers, as many believe Apple should have lowered commissions for everyone years ago, not just for small business developers.\nAppfigures\u2019 analysis also broke down U.S. App Store revenue by apps and games, which generated Apple approximately $6.28 billion and $3.83 billion, respectively, in 2024.\nTogether, these figures highlight how critical App Store revenue remains to Apple\u2019s bottom line, and why it\u2019s fighting so hard to retain control.\"\n\nResponse:",
