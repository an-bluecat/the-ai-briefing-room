The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021.\nMeesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing.\nSome of Meesho\u2019s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers \u2014 including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity \u2014 are not selling any shares.\nMeesho\u2019s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth \u20b911.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.\nFounded in 2015, Meesho began as a social commerce platform that targeted first-time online shoppers through WhatsApp before evolving into a full-fledged marketplace. It has since carved out a fast-growing niche with a low-cost model tailored to India\u2019s price-sensitive consumers and small merchants \u2014 an approach that has increasingly pressured larger rivals Amazon and Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based company uses a commission-light model, earning primarily from logistics fees, advertising, and other services, while charging commissions on products sold through its separate Meesho Mall channel.\nMeesho reported revenue from operations of \u20b955.78 billion (about $624.0 million) for the six months ended September 30, up from \u20b943.11 billion (around $482.0 million) a year earlier, per its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% year-over-year to \u20b9191.94 billion (roughly $2.15 billion). However, its losses widened, with Meesho posting a restated loss before tax of \u20b94.33 billion (around $48.4 million) for the September 2025 half-year, compared with \u20b90.24 billion (about $2.7 million) a year earlier.\nIn the last 12 months, Meesho recorded 234.20 million transacting users \u2014 unique consumers who purchased at least one product on the platform. Over the same period, the company had 706,471 annual transacting sellers, defined as sellers who received at least one order in the year.\nMeesho also uses a sprawling creator network for product discovery, with more than 50,000 active content creators generating at least one placed order through their content over the past year.\n\u201cMany Indians are only experiencing e-commerce for the first time on Meesho, and much like the rest of us, over the next decade, they will buy more and more things and more and more frequently on this platform,\u201d Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director at Peak XV Partners, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s why long-term conviction is the reason to hold on to as much of our stake as we can hold on to.\u201d\nPeak XV \u2014 which first invested in Meesho in 2018 during its Sequoia Capital India era and holds about 13% across its two vehicles \u2014 is selling around 17.38 million shares in the IPO.\nMeesho has positioned itself as a value-focused platform \u2014 unlike Amazon and Flipkart, which it sees as convenience-led players. In that respect, the company compares itself with other value-driven marketplaces such as Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America.\n\u201cIf you look at the value-focused bucket, here, you are trying to appeal to mass market consumers selling all kinds of products and categories in a marketplace business model, which tends to be asset light,\u201d Aatrey told reporters during Meesho\u2019s press conference on Friday. \u201cAnd the reason people come back is because they want access to more and more selection with the affordability value proposition.\u201d\nMeesho also sees the IPO improving its ability to attract talent and strengthening confidence across its wider ecosystem, CFO Dhiresh Bansal told TechCrunch. He said a public listing boosts the company\u2019s brand with job candidates \u2014 including those coming from big tech firms \u2014 and has a positive knock-on effect on consumers, sellers and logistics partners by reinforcing Meesho\u2019s governance standards.\nThe IPO will open for public subscription on December 3, with the anchor book scheduled for December 2. About 75% of the offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 10% for retail investors and 15% for non-institutional investors.\nSoftBank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\ntitle1:\nHow OpenAI and Google see AI changing go-to-market strategies\ndescription1:\nFor years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market.\n\u201cYou can do more with less than ever before,\u201d Max Altschuler, general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month.\nThe challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there\u2019s still a need for more specific domain expertise.\n\u201cWhen you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven\u2019t gone out the window. I think it\u2019s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,\u201d Altschuler said.\nAlison Wagonfeld, vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required.\n\u201cYou certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,\u201d Wagonfeld said.\nTeams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly \u201cYou can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,\u201d , she added.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nMarc Manara, head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it\u2019s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.\u201d\nSpecifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past. Rather than just a simple query of a database, AI prompts can help startups find prospective customers that fit a very specific set of requirements.\nInbound marketing has changed, too, he added, by using the results of those prompts to qualify and score inbound leads \u201cwith a lot more precision could have been in the past.\u201d\nWhen it comes time for a startup to begin crafting its go-to-market strategy, Wagonfeld said its important to consider what qualities it might want in a GTM team.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a change in hiring perspective, where the past it was more about hiring specialists, people who really knew, sometimes even like a sub-specialty within marketing or within sales. And now it\u2019s hiring for a sense of curiosity and understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost the top thing to hire for now.\u201d\n\ntitle2:\nThe race to regulate AI has sparked a federal vs state showdown\ndescription2:\nFor the first time, Washington is getting close to deciding how to regulate artificial intelligence. And the fight that\u2019s brewing isn\u2019t about the technology, it\u2019s about who gets to do the regulating.\nIn the absence of a meaningful federal AI standard that focuses on consumer safety, states have introduced dozens of bills to protect residents against AI-related harms, including California\u2019s AI safety bill SB-53 and Texas\u2019s Responsible AI Governance Act, which prohibits intentional misuse of AI systems.\nThe tech giants and buzzy startups born out of Silicon Valley argue such laws create an unworkable patchwork that threatens innovation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to slow us in the race against China,\u201d Josh Vlasto, co-founder of pro-AI PAC Leading the Future, told TechCrunch.\nThe industry, and several of its transplants in the White House, is pushing for a national standard or none at all. In the trenches of that all-or-nothing battle, new efforts have emerged to prohibit states from enacting their own AI legislation.\nHouse lawmakers are reportedly trying to use the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to block state AI laws. At the same time, a leaked draft of a White House executive order also demonstrates strong support for preempting state efforts to regulate AI.\nA sweeping preemption that would take away states\u2019 rights to regulate AI is unpopular in Congress, which voted overwhelmingly against a similar moratorium earlier this year. Lawmakers have argued that without a federal standard in place, blocking states will leave consumers exposed to harm, and tech companies free to operate without oversight.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Ted Lieu (D-CA) and the bipartisan House AI Task Force are preparing a package of federal AI bills that cover a range of consumer protections, including fraud, healthcare, transparency, child safety, and catastrophic risk. A megabill such as this will likely take months, if not years, to become law, underscoring why the current rush to limit state authority has become one of the most contentious fights in AI policy.\nThe battle lines: NDAA and the EO\nTrump displays an executive order on AI he signed on July 23, 2025. (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) Image Credits:ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP / Getty Images\nEfforts to block states from regulating AI have ramped up in recent weeks.\nThe House has considered tucking language in the NDAA that would prevent states from regulating AI, Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told Punchbowl News. Congress was reportedly working to finalize a deal on the defense bill before Thanksgiving, Politico reported. A source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch negotiations have focused on narrowing the scope to potentially preserve state authority over areas like kids\u2019 safety and transparency.\nMeanwhile, a leaked White House EO draft reveals the administration\u2019s own potential preemption strategy. The EO, which has reportedly been put on hold, would create an \u201cAI Litigation Task Force\u201d to challenge state AI laws in court, direct agencies to evaluate state laws deemed \u201conerous,\u201d and push the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Trade Commission towards national standards that override state rules.\nNotably, the EO would give David Sacks \u2013 Trump\u2019s AI and Crypto Czar and co-founder of VC firm Craft Ventures \u2013 co-lead authority on creating a uniform legal framework. This would give Sacks direct influence over AI policy that supersedes the typical role of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and its head Michael Kratsios.\nSacks has publicly advocated for blocking state regulation and keeping federal oversight menial, favoring industry self-regulation to \u201cmaximize growth.\u201d\nThe patchwork argument\nSacks\u2019s position mirrors the viewpoint of much of the AI industry. Several pro-AI super PACs have emerged in recent months, throwing hundreds of millions of dollars into local and state elections to oppose candidates who support AI regulation.\nLeading the Future \u2013 backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI president Greg Brockman, Perplexity, and Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale \u2013 has raised more than $100 million. This week, Leading the Future launched a $10 million campaign pushing Congress to craft a national AI policy that overrides state laws.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to drive innovation in the tech sector, you can\u2019t have a situation where all these laws keep popping up from people who don\u2019t necessarily have the technical expertise,\u201d Vlasto told TechCrunch.\nHe argued that a patchwork of state regulations will \u201cslow us in the race against China.\u201d\nNathan Leamer, executive director of Build American AI, the PAC\u2019s advocacy arm, confirmed the group supports preemption without AI-specific federal consumer protections in place. Leamer argued that existing laws, like those addressing fraud or product liability, are sufficient to handle AI harms. Where state laws often seek to prevent problems before they arise, Leamer favors a more reactive approach: let companies move fast, address problems in court later.\nNo preemption without representation\nAlex Bores speaking at an event in Washington, D.C., on November 17, 2025. Image Credits:TechCrunch\nAlex Bores, a New York Assembly member running for Congress, is one of Leading the Future\u2019s first targets. He sponsored the RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have safety plans to prevent critical harms.\n\u201cI believe in the power of AI, and that is why it is so important to have reasonable regulations,\u201d Bores told TechCrunch. \u201cUltimately, the AI that\u2019s going to win in the marketplace is going to be trustworthy AI, and often the marketplace undervalues or puts poor short-term incentives on investing in safety.\u201d\nBores supports a national AI policy, but argues states can move faster to address emerging risks.\nAnd it\u2019s true that states move quicker.\nAs of November 2025, 38 states have adopted more than 100 AI-related laws this year, mainly targeting deepfakes, transparency and disclosure, and government use of AI. (A recent study found that 69% of those laws impose no requirements on AI developers at all.)\nActivity in Congress provides more evidence of the slower-than-states argument. Hundreds of AI bills have been introduced, but few have passed. Since 2015, Rep. Lieu has introduced 67 bills to the House Science Committee. Only one became law.\nMore than 200 lawmakers signed an open letter opposing preemption in the NDAA, arguing that \u201cstates serve as laboratories of democracies\u201d that must \u201cretain the flexibility to confront new digital challenges as they arise.\u201d Nearly 40 state attorneys general also sent an open letter opposing a state AI regulation ban.\nCybersecurity expert Bruce Schneier and data scientist Nathan E. Sanders \u2013 authors of Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship \u2013 argue the patchwork complaint is overblown.\nAI companies already comply with tougher EU regulations, they note, and most industries find a way to operate under varying state laws. The real motive, they say, is avoiding accountability.\nWhat could a federal standard look like?\nLieu is drafting an over 200-page megabill he hopes to introduce in December. It covers a range of issues, like fraud penalties, deepfake protections, whistleblower protections, compute resources for academia, and mandatory testing and disclosure for large language model companies.\nThat last provision would require AI labs to test their models and publish results \u2013 something most do voluntarily now. Lieu hasn\u2019t yet introduced the bill, but he said it doesn\u2019t direct any federal agencies to review AI models directly. That differs from a similar bill introduced by Sens Josh Hawley (R-MS) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CN) which would require a government-run evaluation program for advanced AI systems before they deployed.\nLieu acknowledged his bill wouldn\u2019t be as strict, but he said it had a better chance at making it into law.\n\u201cMy goal is to get something into law this term,\u201d Lieu said, noting that House Majority Leader Scalise is openly hostile to AI regulation. \u201cI\u2019m not writing a bill that I\u2019d have if I were king. I\u2019m trying to write a bill that could pass a Republican-controlled House, a Republican-controlled Senate, and a Republican-controlled White House.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nBest iPad apps to boost productivity and make your life easier\ndescription3:\nApple\u2019s iPads come with built-in productivity tools like Notes, Calendar, and Reminders, but if you\u2019d like to explore new ways to maximize productivity and organize your life, there are many apps out there to help you.\nAlthough the iPad started off as a device that could be used to stream content or browse the web on the go, Apple has essentially turned its iPads into computers that can handle a variety of different tasks for personal, work, and school use.
