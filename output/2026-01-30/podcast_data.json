TechCrunch reached out to Martin to learn how this news has affected SpaceX secondary sales. His response:\n\u201cThe news that SpaceX may be considering various transactions with xAI and Tesla, has caused a temporary pause in the market for SpaceX shares, as shareholders and investors sort through the implications of these potential transactions. As both SpaceX and Tesla look to expand their business identities beyond their core businesses to reflect their future leadership in AI, the merger of any of these entities is increasingly intriguing.\u201c\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nGreg, welcome to the show. Before we dive in, can you share a bit about your background?\nI\u2019m founder and managing director of Rainmaker Securities, which specializes in helping large late-stage, pre-IPO companies transact shares in the secondary market. I am also the founder of a secondary firm that buys private company shares called Archer Capital Group, and co-founder of Liquid Stock, a business that helps employees and executives exercise their options using their shares as collateral.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\nI\u2019m sure the secondaries business has been booming with this IPO drought from the past couple years.\nNo doubt. Private companies are staying private much longer now. Many of these businesses \u2014 including SpaceX and other companies that would be top 30 in the S&P 500 \u2014 would historically have gone public years ago.\nThese companies are significant in our economy, and investors really want access to these companies. At the same time, there are shareholders and executives and founders who have been in them for a long time and want to start seeing some liquidity from their shares, which are a very high percentage of their net worth.\nSo these two forces have created a thriving secondary market. And we only see this trend growing because more market cap is now housed in the private markets.\nDo you imagine the secondary markets shifting if we have a break in IPOs this year?\nIt\u2019s an interesting question, because clearly when a SpaceX goes public, you could argue that $800 billion has just left the private system and is now in the public markets. But I think it just increases interest in more companies offering liquidity, and more investors coming into private markets. While SpaceX is a one-of-kind company, there are a lot of companies that are being started today and that are growing very fast. I mean, three or four years ago, what were OpenAI and Anthropic valued at? Those are now over a trillion dollars of combined market cap.\nI really see the trend of the opportunity in the private secondary spaces as growing overall, and frankly, when we see the matriculation of SpaceX to the public markets, I think it\u2019s going to actually increase the capital market interest in private companies.\nWhat are some things you\u2019re noticing around the SpaceX IPO?\nIf you think about the IPO market the last few years, it\u2019s been pretty dismal since 2021, so the markets are really waiting for a bellwether company. And I think SpaceX is clearly a bellwether company\u2026and there\u2019s a huge amount of interest in that company.\nSpaceX also just did a tender at an $800 billion valuation, and we see a ton of interest on our platform at Rainmaker in continuing to buy into the secondary. And it\u2019s not just SpaceX.\nWe\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in some of the other bellwether companies, whether it\u2019s ByteDance, whether it\u2019s Stripe, Databricks, obviously OpenAI, Anthropic, the AI businesses, Perplexity. So there is a lot of interest, but SpaceX, I think, is the one that people are following the most closely. And I really think it could create a reset in the IPO market if it were to go public this year.\nWhat kind of bid movement are you seeing on your platform?\nSpaceX has continued to defy gravity. Even during the down periods of \u201822 and \u201823, SpaceX was the one company that continued to price up every time there was a hint of the company going public.\nWe have seen a significant uptick in interest, both from a size and a price point \u2014 it\u2019s already pricing well above where the last tender round was and getting closer to that trillion and a half that they had discussed as a potential IPO price.\nElon Musk famously said he wouldn\u2019t take SpaceX public until rockets were flying to Mars regularly. Why is he racing to the public markets now?\nThe company has been private for a long time, so I wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s racing to go public, although his stance has shifted.\nWe are in a very good market, we\u2019re at all-time highs across the board. SpaceX has seen a large amount of interest in the private markets, but the private markets are constrained. Not every investor on the planet can access the private markets.\nSpaceX has a huge opportunity in front of it. They dominate the rocket-launching business.\nThey\u2019re building an amazing Starlink business. They have Starship, which has so many businesses related to it, whether it\u2019s sending bulk payloads into space or logistics around the world. Now they\u2019re talking about building data centers in space, and as a truly vertically integrated company, they can manage it.\nAnd so it just makes sense, given the positive market dynamics and massive potential opportunity that SpaceX could address across its many business lines. Why not go and unlock all the rest of the capital markets to help them fund their businesses?\nYou could argue that it does open up that potential risk channel. I think if they do a public offering, it\u2019ll probably be a sliver deal, so only 5% of their company that\u2019s technically available. Now we\u2019ll see what happens, but at least things will be out in the open and publicly disclosed, so they can see who owns their shares.\nThe question will then become, do any of these companies \u2014 even if they\u2019re in adversarial countries \u2014 have any real control? If they\u2019re just economic interests, that\u2019s something that can be tolerated. The reality is, Elon and a pretty tight-knit group of people will still continue to control the company.\nYou said it\u2019s not a race to IPO, but it certainly feels that way now, in part because of Elon Musk\u2019s public feud with Sam Altman, who is also chasing close to a $1 trillion IPO. Altman is also looking to buy Stoke Space, while Bezos is talking about orbital data centers. A lot of rivals appear to be converging on a similar mission.\nSpaceX\u2019s success is going to breed some imitation. We\u2019ve heard now that Bezos is going to launch a communication network to compete with Starlink, but they\u2019re a long way behind. And OpenAI has its own set of capital risks in the core business that they have to address. So for them to go public makes a ton of sense, because the AI trade is still very hot in the public markets. They have an insatiable need for capital right now, if you look at their burn rate. So there\u2019s no point in them constraining the investors that can access their company, because right now they need capital.\nI think SpaceX can be a little more measured. They can find the right time when the market presents itself well, because they have a business that is largely profitable, and they have dominance in their two key businesses. So they\u2019re in the driver\u2019s seat.\nIf there\u2019s any downdraft in the market, I think they\u2019ll stay private.\nIt\u2019s not all roses for SpaceX. They are facing their own challenges launching Starship V3, and several of their aircraft have exploded over the past year. But a lot of that might not matter since this is an Elon Musk company, and those tend to do well in terms of stock price just off the back of his name. How do you think the SpaceX IPO will be priced relative to what its actual balance sheet says, versus the impact of Elon Musk and his empire?\nIt will definitely get a premium multiple. There\u2019s an Elon halo effect, and he\u2019s delivered. Even though Tesla\u2019s primary revenues come from automobiles, it\u2019s completely vertically integrated. It captures data. It now has self-driving taxis. It has Optimus robots \u2013\nIt\u2019s got a minimal rollout of self-driving taxis and Optimus is still years away\u2026\nRobots are the future at Tesla. Tesla is really a state of the art manufacturing company, and Elon owns xAI, Twitter, SpaceX \u2014 these companies can be very virtuous.\nI do think there\u2019s a halo effect around Elon and that creates some pressure, too. So I expect he will get a premium well and above what typical market rates would be for a company like SpaceX, given their balance sheet and revenue.\nI think people believe in the future of a data center in space that\u2019s cooled by space and run by solar panels directly from the sun. I mean, it sounds crazy and pie in the sky, just like going to Mars sounds crazy and pie in the sky. But if anyone can do it, Elon\u2019s probably the guy.\nYou say that, but he hasn\u2019t actually done a lot of the weird pie in the sky stuff that he has promised to do. In fact, others have beat him to the punch, especially when it comes to full self-driving.\nThat will be debated by investors and will be where the tension is. When you put so much value in the belief that one person can exceed expectations continuously, that\u2019s a big challenge. And some people will not be comfortable with that risk.\nHow significant is it that SpaceX is lining up banks for a 2026 IPO?\nIt\u2019s a pretty big signal. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re just playing games.\nBut having a conversation with banks doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the IPO is coming this year. What are some other signals that people could watch for when a company is getting ready to go public \u2014 not just SpaceX, but anyone?\nLook at the people they hire and if that portends more of an IPO senior executive team versus an entrepreneurial team. If they seem really focused on a chief accounting officer from a public company. Or if there\u2019s a swap out and a new CFO comes in with deep public company experience. If they\u2019re beefing up their investor relations team, accounting, legal.\nCompanies like SpaceX have had public-grade teams for a while, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot to learn there.\nZooming out a little bit, how would you say private-market valuations typically compare to what companies achieve in their IPOs?\nIt\u2019s a good sign for private companies to pre-understand their demand. If a company didn\u2019t have that and they basically had to rely on a two-week marketing period from when they file publicly or if they start a road show where they only talk to top accountants, that\u2019s often when you have a really difficult pricing environment because they\u2019re not getting proper price discovery.\nSo we\u2019re really pushing companies to actually open up your private secondary capability because it\u2019s a great way to develop price discovery well in advance of the IPO, to start getting people attached to your business, to open yourself up to a broader investor base. That way, by the time you do go on your road show, you actually have a pretty good view of what your price should be, and you end up with a much more efficient IPO.\nThink about when Figma went public and traded up 200% \u2014 that\u2019s not really a good IPO. That\u2019s a company that probably didn\u2019t do very good price discovery in advance.\nWalk us through how secondaries actually work. Let\u2019s say I\u2019m a SpaceX employee with stock options. What are my options before IPO?\nAll private companies are not created equally. SpaceX has very tight controls on their cap table, partially because they don\u2019t want to exceed the number of shareholders, at which point they would have to be a public company. And so Space X, unlike most companies, runs tender offers two or three times a year, so there tends to be a reasonable amount of liquidity for employees.\nNow there\u2019s also what I would call the SPV (special purpose vehicle) world that trades in SpaceX, where people put their shares in SPVs and then trade units in their SPVs, rather than the shares themselves. So there actually isn\u2019t a cap table change, but there is an economic ownership change by virtue of trading units in the SPV. That\u2019s where most of the trading in SpaceX lies.\nWhereas some companies allow trading of shares directly on their cap table, and some companies absolutely prohibit all secondary transactions, which I don\u2019t think is a good idea. That\u2019s why people work with firms like Rainmaker, because we get to know the companies. We get to know how they monitor and guard trades so we can help get those trades done. We can help provide liquidity for people who want it. We can provide either ownership of the shares or ownership in the economics of the shares for investors.\nYou say access to information is one of an investor\u2019s biggest problems in the secondary markets. Does Rainmaker help provide information?\nWe work with some companies where we\u2019re provided data rooms and can provide access to information. We do our own research on anything publicly available and have a view of supply and demand dynamics. So we have a lot of information we can provide, but we can\u2019t share inside company information unless the company allows it. Increasingly, we\u2019re helping companies with those processes. The more information we can provide, the lower the risk for investors, and that tends to open up markets. But it\u2019s an evolving process. These are private companies for a reason \u2014 they\u2019re guarded with what they want to share, and we\u2019re very respectful of that.\nWhat are sophisticated investors looking for when they buy pre-IPO shares at this scale?\nJust like a traditional investor, they would want to be able to do their due diligence across financials, across management. They certainly would like an understanding of the cap table \u2014 like how many shares are outstanding, what\u2019s the preferences? What does this price represent? What\u2019s the debt? They would love to understand what the supply and demand equilibrium is like.\nThe more they have, the better. That\u2019s why they\u2019re more comfortable with more public-facing private companies, like SpaceX \u2014 even without exact historical financials \u2014 than the less well-known names.\nAre you seeing more of an appetite for buying secondary shares from other late-stage unicorns? What companies would you point to?\nWe continue to see substantial demand for companies like Databricks, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, ByteDance. The AI trade continues to be strong, whether it\u2019s Lambda Labs or Cohere, which is a Canadian company near and dear to my heart.\nAs companies signal they\u2019re going to go public \u2014 like Discord, Motive, Canva \u2014 people get a feeling that there\u2019s going to be liquidity, and that\u2019s when we start to see things open. There are probably 20 to 30 companies on our platform that trade pretty regularly, and that just continues to grow. As the IPO market starts to open up, we\u2019re going to see that broaden.\nLike in 2021, we were trading hundreds of companies, and then as the IPO market closed, and that number compressed. But last year was our biggest year \u2014 we were trading over $1 billion worth of secondaries.\nWhere can our listeners connect with you online?\nI\u2019m on LinkedIn.

The deal would value the platform at $5.5 billion.\nThe source said that of that $5.5 billion, $3.5 billion would be equity and $2 billion would be debt. Under those terms, Architect would assume a 60% stake in the business. The two parties are in exclusivity, meaning that OnlyFans is barred from negotiating with other potential buyers for a set period of time. It\u2019s unclear what the timeline for completing the deal might be. The negotiations were previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\nTechCrunch reached out to Architect Capital for comment.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time in recent memory that OnlyFans has been in talks to sell off its business. Last year, the New York Post reported that Leonid Radvinsky, the billionaire owner of the site, was looking to \u201ccash out,\u201d and was courting potential buyers. Subsequent reporting showed that the platform\u2019s parent company, Fenix International Ltd., was in talks with a U.S.-based investor group led by the Los Angeles-based investment firm Forest Road Company. It\u2019s unclear what happened to those discussions, although the source told TechCrunch that there had been a number of interested parties since OnlyFans announced its desire to sell a majority stake.\nThe potential business partner in this particular deal, Architect, launched in 2021 as an asset-based lender \u2014 a firm that provides loans secured by company assets \u2014 that looks to partner with early-stage startups.\nOnlyFans maintains that it\u2019s not a pornography website, despite the fact that a majority of the creators on it produce adult content. A British firm, the site was founded in 2016 by Tim Stokely, who also initially served as its CEO. Stokely sold a majority stake of the site\u2019s parent company, Fenix International, to Radvinsky in 2018. Over the years, it has suffered from a variety of legal controversies, including lawsuits accusing the site of profiting off of abusive videos.\n\ntitle2:\na16z partner Kofi Ampadu to leave firm after TxO program pause\ndescription2:\nKofi Ampadu, the partner at a16z who led the firm\u2019s Talent x Opportunity (TxO) fund and program, has left the firm, according to an email he sent to staff that TechCrunch obtained. This comes months after the firm paused TxO and laid off most of its staff.\n\u201cDuring my time at the firm, I was deeply grateful for the opportunity and the trust to lead this work,\u201d Ampadu wrote in the email, sent Friday afternoon, with the subject line \u201cClosing My a16z Chapter.\u201d\n\u201cIdentifying out-of-network entrepreneurs and supporting them as they sharpened their ideas, raised capital, and grew into confident leaders was one of the most meaningful experiences of my career,\u201d he wrote.\nAmpadu led the program, which launched in 2020, for over four years until its pause last November, taking over for the initial leader, Nait Jones. Afterward, Ampadu seems to have worked at a16z\u2019s latest accelerator, Speedrun.\nAmpadu\u2019s departure perhaps signals the end of the TxO chapter. The fund and program focused on supporting underserved founders by providing access to tech networks and investment capital through a donor-advised fund. Though some founders spoke highly of the program, others criticized the controversial donor-advised structure. The program also launched a grant program in 2024 to provide $50,000 to nonprofits that help diverse founders.\nIts last cohort was in March 2025, and its indefinite pause came as many top tech names reframe, cut, or eliminate prior public commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We\u2019ve reached out to a16z and Ampadu for comment.\nHis full note below:\n\ntitle3:\nPhysical Intelligence, Stripe veteran Lachy Groom's latest bet, is building Silicon Valley's buzziest robot brains\ndescription3:\nFrom the street, the only indication I\u2019ve found Physical Intelligence\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco is a pi symbol that\u2019s a slightly different color than the rest of the door. When I walk in, I\u2019m immediately confronted with activity. There\u2019s no reception desk, no gleaming logo in fluorescent lights.\nInside, the space is a giant concrete box made slightly less austere by a haphazard sprawl of long blonde-wood tables. Some are clearly meant for lunch, dotted with Girl Scout cookie boxes, jars of Vegemite (someone here is Australian), and small wire baskets stuffed with one too many condiments. The rest of the tables tell a different story entirely. Many more of them are laden with monitors, spare robotics parts, tangles of black wire, and fully assembled robotic arms in various states of attempting to master the mundane.\nDuring my visit, one arm is folding a pair of black pants, or trying to. It\u2019s not going well. Another is attempting to turn a shirt inside out with the kind of determination that suggests it will eventually succeed, just not today. A third \u2014 this one seems to have found its calling \u2014 is quickly peeling a zucchini, after which it is supposed to deposit the shavings into a separate container. The shavings are going well, at least.\n\u201cThink of it like ChatGPT, but for robots,\u201d Sergey Levine tells me, gesturing toward the motorized ballet unfolding across the room. Levine, an associate professor at UC Berkeley and one of Physical Intelligence\u2019s co-founders, has the amiable, bespectacled demeanor of someone who has spent considerable time explaining complex concepts to people who don\u2019t immediately grasp them.\nImage Credits:Connie Loizos for TechCrunch\nWhat I\u2019m watching, he explains, is the testing phase of a continuous loop: data gets collected on robot stations here and at other locations \u2014 warehouses, homes, wherever the team can set up shop \u2014 and that data trains general-purpose robotic foundation models. When researchers train a new model, it comes back to stations like these for evaluation. The pants-folder is someone\u2019s experiment. So is the shirt-turner. The zucchini-peeler might be testing whether the model can generalize across different vegetables, learning the fundamental motions of peeling well enough to handle an apple or a potato it\u2019s never encountered.\nThe company also operates a test kitchen in this building and elsewhere using off-the-shelf hardware to expose the robots to different environments and challenges. There\u2019s a sophisticated espresso machine nearby, and I assume it\u2019s for the staff until Levine clarifies that no, it\u2019s there for the robots to learn. Any foamed lattes are data, not a perk for the dozens of engineers on the scene who are mostly peering into their computers or hovering over their mechanized experiments.\nThe hardware itself is deliberately unglamorous. These arms sell for about $3,500, and that\u2019s with what Levine describes as \u201can enormous markup\u201d from the vendor. If they manufactured them in-house, the material cost would drop below $1,000. A few years ago, he says, a roboticist would have been shocked these things could do anything at all. But that\u2019s the point \u2014 good intelligence compensates for bad hardware.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

At 31, Groom still has the fresh-faced quality of Silicon Valley\u2019s boy wonder, a designation he earned early, having sold his first company nine months after starting it at age 13 in his native Australia (this explains the Vegemite).\nWhen I first approached him earlier, as he welcomed a small gaggle of sweatshirt-wearing visitors into the building, his response to my request for time with him was immediate: \u201cAbsolutely not, I\u2019ve got meetings.\u201d Now he has 10 minutes, maybe.\nGroom found what he was looking for when he started following the academic work coming out of the labs of Levine and Chelsea Finn, a former Berkeley PhD student of Levine\u2019s who now runs her own lab at Stanford focused on robotic learning. Their names kept appearing in everything interesting happening in robotics. When he heard rumors they might be starting something, he tracked down Karol Hausman, a Google DeepMind researcher who also taught at Stanford and who Groom had learned was involved. \u201cIt was just one of those meetings where you walk out and it\u2019s like, This is it.\u201d\nGroom never intended to become a full-time investor, he tells me, even though some might wonder why not given his track record. After leaving Stripe, where he was an early employee, he spent roughly five years as an angel investor, making early bets on companies like Figma, Notion, Ramp, and Lattice while searching for the right company to start or join himself. His first robotics investment, Standard Bots, came in 2021 and reintroduced him to a field he\u2019d loved as a kid building Lego Mindstorms. As he jokes, he was \u201con vacation much more as an investor.\u201d But investing was just a way to stay active and meet people, not the endgame. \u201cI was looking for five years for the company to go start post-Stripe,\u201d he says. \u201cGood ideas at a good time with a good team \u2014 [that\u2019s] extremely rare. It\u2019s all execution, but you can execute like hell on a bad idea, and it\u2019s still a bad idea.\u201d\nImage Credits:Connie Loizos for TechCrunch\nThe two-year-old company has now raised over $1 billion, and when I ask about its runway, he\u2019s quick to clarify it doesn\u2019t actually burn that much. Most of its spending goes toward compute. A moment later, he acknowledges that under the right terms, with the right partners, he\u2019d raise more. \u201cThere\u2019s no limit to how much money we can really put to work,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s always more compute you can throw at the problem.\u201d\nWhat makes this arrangement particularly unusual is what Groom doesn\u2019t give his backers: a timeline for turning Physical Intelligence into a money-making endeavor. \u201cI don\u2019t give investors answers on commercialization,\u201d he says of backers that include Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, and Thrive Capital among others that have valued the company at $5.6 billion. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of a weird thing, that people tolerate that.\u201d But tolerate it they do, and they may not always, which is why it behooves the company to be well-capitalized now.\nSo what\u2019s the strategy, if not commercialization? Quan Vuong, another co-founder who came from Google DeepMind, explains that it revolves around cross-embodiment learning and diverse data sources. If someone builds a new hardware platform tomorrow, they won\u2019t need to start data collection from scratch \u2014 they can transfer all the knowledge the model already has. \u201cThe marginal cost of onboarding autonomy to a new robot platform, whatever that platform might be, it\u2019s just a lot lower,\u201d he says.\nThe company is already working with a small number of companies in different verticals \u2014 logistics, grocery, a chocolate maker across the street \u2014 to test whether their systems are good enough for real-world automation. Vuong claims that in some cases, they already are. With their \u201cany platform, any task\u201d approach, the surface area for success is large enough to start checking off tasks that are ready for automation today.\nPhysical Intelligence isn\u2019t alone in chasing this vision. The race to build general-purpose robotic intelligence \u2014 the foundation on which more specialized applications can be built, much like the LLM models that captivated the world three years ago \u2014 is heating up. Pittsburgh-based Skild AI, founded in 2023, just this month raised $1.4 billion at a $14 billion valuation and is taking a notably different approach. While Physical Intelligence remains focused on pure research, Skild AI has already deployed its \u201comni-bodied\u201d Skild Brain commercially, saying it generated $30 million in revenue in just a few months last year across security, warehouses, and manufacturing.\nImage Credits:Connie Loizos for TechCrunch\nSkild has even taken public shots at competitors, arguing on its blog that most \u201crobotics foundation models\u201d are just vision-language models \u201cin disguise\u201d that lack \u201ctrue physical common sense\u201d because they rely too heavily on internet-scale pretraining rather than physics-based simulation and real robotics data.\nIt\u2019s a pretty sharp philosophical divide. Skild AI is betting that commercial deployment creates a data flywheel that improves the model with each real-world use case. Physical Intelligence is betting that resisting the pull of near-term commercialization will enable it to produce superior general intelligence. Who\u2019s \u201cmore right\u201d will take years to resolve.\nIn the meantime, Physical Intelligence operates with what Groom describes as unusual clarity. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pure company. A researcher has a need, we go and collect data to support that need \u2014 or new hardware or whatever it is \u2014 and then we do it. It\u2019s not externally driven.\u201d The company had a 5- to 10-year roadmap of what the team thought would be possible. By month 18, they\u2019d blown through it, he says.\nThe company has about 80 employees and plans to grow, though Groom says hopefully \u201cas slowly as possible.\u201d What\u2019s the most challenging, he says, is hardware. \u201cHardware is just really hard. Everything we do is so much harder than a software company.\u201d Hardware breaks. It arrives slowly, delaying tests. Safety considerations complicate everything.\nAs Groom springs up to rush to his next commitment, I\u2019m left watching the robots continue their practice. The pants are still not quite folded. The shirt remains stubbornly right-side-out. The zucchini shavings are piling up nicely.\nThere are obvious questions, including my own, about whether anyone actually wants a robot in their kitchen peeling vegetables, about safety, about dogs going crazy at mechanical intruders in their homes, about whether all of the time and money being invested here solves big enough problems or creates new ones. Meanwhile, outsiders question the company\u2019s progress, whether its vision is achievable, and if betting on general intelligence rather than specific applications makes sense.\nIf Groom has any doubts, he doesn\u2019t show it. He\u2019s working with people who\u2019ve been working on this problem for decades and who believe the timing is finally right, which is all he needs to know.\nBesides, Silicon Valley has been backing people like Groom and giving them a lot of rope since the beginning of the industry, knowing there\u2019s a good chance that even without a clear path to commercialization, even without a timeline, even without certainty about what the market will look like when they get there, they\u2019ll figure it out. It doesn\u2019t always work out. But when it does, it tends to justify a lot of the times it didn\u2019t.\n\ntitle4:\nBlue Origin pauses space tourism flights to focus on the moon\ndescription4:\nJeff Bezos\u2019 space company Blue Origin is pausing its space tourism flights for \u201cno less than two years\u201d in order to focus all of its resources on upcoming missions to the moon, the company announced Friday.\nThe decision puts a temporary halt on a program that Blue Origin has been using to fly humans past the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the recognized boundary of space, for the last five years.\nBlue Origin made the announcement just a few weeks ahead of the expected third launch of its New Glenn mega-rocket, which is slated for late February. The company had previously suggested it was going to use the third New Glenn launch to send its robotic lunar lander to the moon, but that spacecraft is still undergoing testing at NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Texas.\nSince retaking office, President Donald Trump has put pressure on NASA to send astronauts back to the moon before the end of his second term. That has cleared the way for companies other than SpaceX to compete for these missions.\n\u201cThe decision reflects Blue Origin\u2019s commitment to the nation\u2019s goal of returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent, sustained lunar presence,\u201d the company wrote Friday.\nBlue Origin first flew the New Shepard rocket more than a decade ago, and it became the first rocket to go to space and safely land back on Earth. Unlike SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9, though, the New Shepard rocket was never intended to reach Earth orbit. Its utility has therefore been limited to space tourism flights, which allow passengers around four minutes of weightlessness in Blue Origin\u2019s space capsule, and science missions.\nThe company said Friday that New Shepard has flown 38 times and carried 98 humans to space, along with more than 200 scientific and research payloads.\nTechcrunch event TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026: Tickets Live On June 23 in Boston, more than 1,100 founders come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

There were no humans on that flight, and the capsule safely ejected away from the booster. But New Shepard remained grounded until late 2023 while Blue Origin worked on identifying and fixing the cause.\"\n\nResponse:",
