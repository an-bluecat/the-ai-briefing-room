Tesla is asking shareholders to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, which a Delaware judge voided earlier this year. The judge ruled that the record-setting compensation deal was, quote, deeply flawed. Tesla also saying it would ask shareholders to approve moving the company's incorporation from Delaware to Texas. The company has hired a proxy solicitor and plans to spend millions of dollars to help secure votes for the two proposals. Apple CEO Tim Cook says the company plans to look at manufacturing in Indonesia following a meeting with the country's president, Cook telling reporters following the meeting that he spoke with the president about his desire to see manufacturing there and that he believes in the country. The comments come as Apple is pushed to diversify its supply chain with more manufacturing outside of China in countries such as Vietnam and India. Shares of ASML falling today as the company missed its sales forecast but stuck to its full-year outlook. Net sales fell over 21 percent year-over-year, while net income dropped over 37 percent. ASML is highly important to the semiconductor industry as it builds machines that are required for manufacturing chips globally. Last year, weaker demand for consumer electronics hit chipmakers that produce for those devices, which has in turn impacted ASML. That's all for today.

It\u2019s a signal of just how critical this work has become as Google pours up to $93 billion into capital expenditures by the end of 2025 \u2014 a number that parent company Alphabet expects will be a whole lot bigger next year.\nVahdat isn\u2019t new to the game. The computer scientist, who holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and started as a research intern at Xerox PARC back in the early \u201990s, has been quietly building Google\u2019s AI backbone for the past 15 years. Before joining Google in 2010 as an engineering fellow and VP, he was an associate professor at Duke University and later a professor and SAIC Chair at UC San Diego. His academic credentials are formidable \u2014 with what appears to be around 395 published papers \u2014 and his research has always focused on making computers work more efficiently at massive scale.\nVahdat already maintains a high profile with Google. Just eight months ago, at Google Cloud Next, he took the stage to unveil the company\u2019s seventh-generation TPU, called Ironwood, in his role as VP and GM of ML, Systems, and Cloud AI. The specs he rattled off at the event were staggering, too: over 9,000 chips per pod delivering 42.5 exaflops of compute \u2014 more than 24 times the power of the world\u2019s No. 1 supercomputer at the time, he said. \u201cDemand for AI compute has increased by a factor of 100 million in just eight years,\u201d he told the audience.\nBehind the scenes, as noted by Semafor, Vahdat has been orchestrating the unglamorous and essential work that keeps Google competitive, including those custom TPU chips for AI training and inference that give Google an edge over rivals like OpenAI, as well as the Jupiter network, the super-fast internal network that allows all its servers to talk to each other and move massive amounts of data around. (In a blog post late last year, Vahdat said that Jupiter now scales to 13 petabits per second, explaining that\u2019s enough bandwidth to theoretically support a video call for all 8 billion people on Earth simultaneously.)\nVahdat has also been deeply involved in the ongoing development of the Borg software system, Google\u2019s cluster management system that acts as the brain coordinating all the work happening across its data centers. And he has said he oversaw the development of Axion, Google\u2019s first custom Arm-based general-purpose CPUs designed for data centers, which the company unveiled last year and continues to build.\nIn short, Vahdat is central to Google\u2019s AI story.\nIndeed, in a market where top AI talent commands astronomical compensation and constant recruitment, Google\u2019s decision to elevate Vahdat to the C-suite may also be about retention. When you\u2019ve spent 15 years building someone into a linchpin of your AI strategy, you make sure they stay.\n\ntitle1:\nState attorneys general warn Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and other AI giants to fix 'delusional' outputs\ndescription1:\nAfter a string of disturbing mental health incidents involving AI chatbots, a group of state attorneys general have sent a letter to the AI industry\u2019s top companies, with a warning to fix \u201cdelusional outputs\u201d or risk being in breach of state law.\nThe letter, signed by dozens of AGs from U.S. states and territories with the National Association of Attorneys General, asks the companies, including Microsoft, OpenAI, Google, and 10 other major AI firms, to implement a variety of new internal safeguards to protect their users. Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter.\nThe letter comes as a fight over AI regulations has been brewing between state and federal government.\nThose safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to \u201cevaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,\u201d the letter states.\n\u201cGenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused\u2014and has the potential to cause\u2014serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,\u201d the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year \u2014 including suicides and murder \u2014 in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. \u201cIn many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users\u2019 delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.\u201d\nAGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents \u2014 with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures.\nCompanies should develop and publish \u201cdetection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,\u201d the letter states. In a similar fashion to how data breaches are currently handled, companies should also \u201cpromptly, clearly, and directly notify users if they were exposed to potentially harmful sycophantic or delusional outputs,\u201d the letter says.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nAnother ask is that the companies develop \u201creasonable and appropriate safety tests\u201d on GenAI models to \u201censure the models do not produce potentially harmful sycophantic and delusional outputs.\u201d These tests should be conducted before the models are ever offered to the public, it adds.\nTechCrunch was unable to reach Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI for comment prior to publication. The article will be updated if the companies respond.\nTech companies developing AI have had a much warmer reception at the federal level.\nThe Trump administration has made it known it is unabashedly pro-AI, and, over the past year, multiple attempts have been made to pass a nationwide moratorium on state-level AI regulations. So far, those attempts have failed \u2014 thanks, in part, to pressure from state officials.\nNot to be deterred, Trump announced Monday he plans to pass an executive order next week that will limit the ability of states to regulate AI. The president said in a post on Truth Social he hoped his EO would stop AI from being \u201cDESTROYED IN ITS INFANCY.\u201d\n\ntitle3:\nSpotify tests more personalized, AI-powered 'Prompted Playlists'\ndescription3:\nSpotify announced on Wednesday that, for the first time, it\u2019s giving users more control over the streaming service\u2019s algorithm. That\u2019s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new \u201cPromoted Playlists,\u201d a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.\nThe feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.\nThe new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the \u201cfull arc\u201d of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one \u2014 something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.\nThe feature is an evolution from Spotify\u2019s existing AI playlist option, which debuted last year, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That\u2019s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch.\nIn addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify\u2019s other AI playlist offerings.\nFor instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, \u201cmusic from my top artists from the last five years,\u201d then amend the prompt to include a request for \u201cdeep cuts I haven\u2019t heard yet.\u201d\nImage Credits:Spotify\nIn another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for \u201chigh-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down\u201d or \u201cmusic from this year\u2019s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.\u201d\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nIn addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify\u2019s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that\u2019s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they\u2019d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify\u2019s genre-focused Daily Mixes.\nThe company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you\u2019re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.\nSpotify isn\u2019t the only social app pitching how it\u2019s letting users take control of its algorithm. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own.\n\ntitle4:\nOSHA investigating new crane accident at SpaceX's Starbase facility\ndescription4:\nA construction worker building a concrete wall at SpaceX\u2019s Starbase site in November was crushed by a large metal support that fell from a crane, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is investigating the incident, TechCrunch has learned.\nThe worker, Eduardo Cavazos, filed a previously unreported lawsuit in November detailing the accident, and is suing SpaceX and one of its contractors for negligence. SpaceX reported the incident to OSHA, and the agency opened a \u201crapid response investigation,\u201d according to Joanna Hawkins, deputy regional director of public affairs.\nRapid response investigations typically involve OSHA asking an employer for more information before determining if the agency will perform an on-site inspection. Hawkins said OSHA is still waiting for SpaceX\u2019s response to that request.\nThis is the second known crane-related accident at Starbase this year that OSHA is probing. The agency also opened an investigation into a crane that collapsed at Starbase in late June. It\u2019s still not known if any workers were injured during that accident; neither SpaceX nor Starbase city officials have commented on the collapse, which was caught on livestreamed video by LabPadre.\nThe crane-related accidents are part of a growing list of incidents at the rapidly expanding launch facility in South Texas as CEO Elon Musk has pushed his company to develop massive rockets that can go to the moon and Mars.\nA broken hip, knee, and tibia\nLawyers for Cavazos, a resident of Cameron County, Texas, filed his lawsuit in November just a few days after the accident. They said he was working as a subcontractor of CCC Group, which was hired by SpaceX to construct concrete walls at the Starbase site. On November 15, a crane operator was lifting a \u201cvertical formwork\u201d \u2014 which holds wet concrete in place until it dries \u2014 when one of the long metal supports \u201cdetached\u201d and landed on him, Cavazos\u2019 lawyers claim in the lawsuit.\nIn an amended petition filed this week, Cavazos\u2019 lawyers claim another CCC Group employee was operating the crane and was seen using a cell phone around the time of the accident. The operator \u201crecklessly lowered\u201d the formwork, causing it to strike the ground and surprising Cavazos and two other workers. The operator then suddenly lifted the formwork up, according to the complaint, which is when the 1,200-pound support struck Cavazos.\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\nThe metal support broke Cavazos\u2019 hip, knee, and tibia, and he suffered other injuries to his neck, head, shoulders, back, and legs. \u201cIn all reasonable probability, [Cavazos] has and/or will undergo physical therapy, daily medications, pain management treatment, and/or surgical intervention in an attempt to control the pain caused by the injuries sustained in this incident,\u201d his lawyers wrote in the complaint.\nCavazos sued both CCC Group and SpaceX for negligence and is seeking unspecified damages. He claims both companies should be held responsible for not verifying the metal support was properly attached, and failing to properly warn workers of this type of hazard on the site, among other alleged safety violations.\nRepresentatives for CCC Group and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Cavazos\u2019 lawyers declined to comment beyond the contents of the complaint.\nStarbase\u2019s safety record\nWorkers have sustained serious injuries at SpaceX\u2019s Starbase facility for years. In 2023, a Reuters report about the safety of Starbase uncovered numerous previously unreported injuries, as well as the fact that an employee died at the South Texas site in 2014 when construction began.\nPublicly available data shows the site continues to be dangerous in comparison to other SpaceX facilities and those run by its rivals.\nA TechCrunch analysis of OSHA data this past July found Starbase had a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of around 4.27 injuries per 100 workers in 2024. SpaceX\u2019s McGregor, Texas rocket testing facility had a TRIR of 2.48 in 2024, and its Hawthorne, California site measured out at 1.43. The TRIR for aerospace manufacturing as a whole in 2024 was 1.6 injuries per 100 workers.\nFormer OSHA chief of staff Debbie Berkowitz told TechCrunch at the time that Starbase\u2019s TRIR \u201cis a red flag that there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed.\u201d\nTransparency at Starbase is difficult, too. Companies are supposed to report serious injuries to OSHA within 24 hours if they involve hospitalizations, amputations, or the loss of an eye. While it appears SpaceX did so in the case of Cavazos, OSHA penalized SpaceX $7,000 in early June for not reporting a different injury at Starbase that fell into one of those categories. SpaceX contested the penalty and the two sides reached an undisclosed settlement.\nSpaceX has been building out Starbase for more than a decade, but the company has big plans to expand the facility in the coming years. It\u2019s currently constructing a $250 million, 700,000-square-foot rocket factory called \u201cGigabay\u201d that it expects to finish by the end of 2026. The company has said it could be used to make as many as 1,000 Starship rockets per year.\nThe pressure has only been mounting on SpaceX, too. Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently chastised the company for not moving quickly enough to return astronauts to the moon, after Musk called lunar missions \u201ca distraction\u201d from Mars. Duffy suggested NASA may opt to use rockets from Jeff Bezos\u2019 space company Blue Origin to land people on the moon before China, which is expected to attempt the feat in 2029.\nThis story has been updated with new information from Cavazos\u2019 amended petition.\"\n\nResponse:",
